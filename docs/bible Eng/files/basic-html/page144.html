                  you and all your company have gathered        27  So they went away from the tent of
                  together against Yahweh! What is Aaron Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side.
                  that you complain against him?”             Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood
                    12 Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram,  at the door of their tents with their wives,
                  the sons of Eliab; and they said, “We won’t  their sons, and their little ones.
                  come up!  13 Is it a small thing that you have  28  Moses said, “Hereby you shall know

                  milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,  works; for they are not from my own mind.
                  but you must also make yourself a prince    29  If these men die the common death of

                  neither have I hurt one of them.”             31  As he finished speaking all these
                    16 Moses said to Korah, “You and all your  words, the ground that was under them
                  company go before Yahweh, you, and they,    split apart.  32 The earth opened its mouth
                  and Aaron, tomorrow.    17  Each man take   and swallowed them up with their house-
                  his censer and put incense on it, and each holds, all of Korah’s men, and all their
                  man bring before Yahweh his censer, two     goods.  33  So they, and all that belonged
                  hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, to them went down alive into Sheol. † The
                  each with his censer.”                      earth closed on them, and they perished
                    18 They each took his censer, and put fire  from among the assembly.  34 All Israel that
                  in it, and laid incense on it, and stood at  werearoundthemfledattheircry; forthey
                  the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!”  35 Fire

                    25 Moses rose up and went to Dathan and                         40

                  theirs, lest you be consumed in all their as his company; as Yahweh spoke to him by
