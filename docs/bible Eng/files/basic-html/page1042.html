                  about as much as 2 Roman denarii, or about 2 days’ wages. It was commonly used to pay the half-shekel temple tax,
                  because 2 drachmas were worth one half shekel of silver. A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces. § 17:27
                  A stater is a silver coin equivalent to four Attic or two Alexandrian drachmas, or a Jewish shekel: just exactly enough
                  to cover the half-shekel temple tax for two people. A shekel is about 10 grams or about 0.35 ounces, usually in the
                  form of a silver coin.</code></pre>
