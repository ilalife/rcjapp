                  because Yahweh, the God of your fathers, princes, and gave it to the king of Assyria;
                  was angry with Judah, he has delivered but it didn’t help him.

                  them in a rage which has reached up to passed yet more against Yahweh, this same
                  heaven.  10  Now you intend to degrade the King Ahaz.  23 For he sacrificed to the gods
                  children of Judah and Jerusalem as male of Damascus which had defeated him. He
                  and female slaves for yourselves. Aren’t said, “Because the gods of the kingsof Syria
                  there even with you trespasses of your own helped them, I will sacrifice to them, that
                  against Yahweh your God?  11 Now hear me they may help me.” But they were the ruin
                  therefore, and send back the captives that of him and of all Israel.  24 Ahaz gathered
                  you have taken captive from your brothers, together the vessels of God’s house, cut
                  for the fierce wrath of Yahweh is on you.” the vessels of God’s house in pieces, and

                  and to our guilt; for our guilt is great, and  and Israel.  27  Ahaz slept with his fathers,
                  there is fierce wrath against Israel.”      and they buried him in the city, even in
