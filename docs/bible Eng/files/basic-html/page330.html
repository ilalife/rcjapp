                  sent the captains of his armies against the years.  34  He did that which was evil in
                  cities of Israel, and struck Ijon, and Dan, Yahweh’s sight, and walked in the way of
                  and Abel Beth Maacah, and all Chinneroth, Jeroboam, and in his sin with which he
