                  “one and only”.  † 4:10 “atoning sacrifice” is from the Greek “ιλασμος”, an appeasing, propitiating, or the means
                  of appeasement or propitiation—the sacrifice that turns away God’s wrath because of our sin.  ‡ 4:19 NU omits
                  “him”.  * 5:7 Only a few recent manuscripts add “in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these
