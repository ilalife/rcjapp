                  Yahweh destroyed before the children of his father; and Amon sacrificed to all the

                  brought him again to Jerusalem into his

                  Yahweh’s altar, and offered sacrifices of   Baals in his presence; and he cut down

                  of the seers who spoke to him in the name   and Jerusalem. He did this in the cities of
