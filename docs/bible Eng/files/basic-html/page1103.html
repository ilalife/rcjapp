                    37  They, answering, asked him, “Where, I tell you, whoever doesn’t receive God’s
                  Lord?”                                      Kingdom like a little child, he will in no way

                  there the vultures will also be gathered      18  A certain ruler asked him, saying,
                  together.”                                  “Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit

                    1  He also spoke a parable to them that good? No one is good, except one: God.
                  they must always pray and not give up,      20  You know the commandments: ‘Don’t
                  2 saying, “There was a judge in a certain commit adultery,’ ‘Don’t murder,’ ‘Don’t

                  man.     3  A widow was in that city, and your father and your mother.’ ” ✡
                  she often came to him, saying, ‘Defend me     21  He said, “I have observed all these
                  from my adversary!’     4 He wouldn’t for things from my youth up.”
                  a while; but afterward he said to himself,    22 When Jesus heard these things, he said
                  ‘Though I neither fear God nor respect to him, “You still lack one thing. Sell all
                        5
                  man, yet because this widow bothers me, that you have and distribute it to the poor.
                  I will defend her, or else she will wear me Then you will have treasure in heaven;
                  out by her continual coming.’ ”             then come, follow me.”
                    6  The Lord said, “Listen to what the       23  But when he heard these things, he
                  unrighteous judge says.      7  Won’t God   became very sad, for he was very rich.
                  avenge his chosen ones who are crying out     24 Jesus, seeing that he became very sad,
                  to him day and night, and yet he exercises  said, “How hard it is for those who have
                  patience with them?    8  I tell you that he  riches to enter into God’s Kingdom!  25 For
                  will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless,     it is easier for a camel to enter in through
                  when the Son of Man comes, will he find     a needle’s eye than for a rich man to enter
                  faith on the earth?”                        into God’s Kingdom.”
                    9  He also spoke this parable to certain
                                                                  Those who heard it said, “Then who

                  and prayed by himself like this: ‘God, I
                  thankyou that I am not like the rest of men:  29  He said to them, “Most certainly I tell
                  extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or  you, there is no one who has left house, or
