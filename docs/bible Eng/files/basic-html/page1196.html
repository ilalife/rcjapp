                  keep silent.  31 For you all can prophesy one so we preach, and so you believed.

                  exhorted.  32  The spirits of the prophets been raised from the dead, how do some
                  are subject to the prophets,  33  for God is among you say that there is no resurrec-

                  not been permitted for them to be talking   then our preaching is in vain and your faith
                                                              also is in vain.
