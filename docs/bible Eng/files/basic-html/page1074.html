                    1  It was now two days before the           16  His disciples went out, and came into
                  Passover and the Feast of Unleavened the city, and found things as he had said to
                  Bread, and the chief priests and the scribes  them, and they prepared the Passover.
                  sought how they might seize him by de-        17 When it was evening he came with the
                  ception and kill him. For they said, “Not   twelve.  18 Astheysatandwereeating, Jesus

                  riot among the people.”                     will betray me—he who eats with me.”
                    3  While he was at Bethany, in the house    19
                                                                  They began to be sorrowful, and to

                  a woman came having an alabaster jar of
                  ointment of pure nard—very costly. She      another said, “Surely not I?”
                  broke the jar and poured it over his head.    20  He answered them, “It is one of the

                  they grumbled against her.                    22  As they were eating, Jesus took bread,

                  twelve, went away to the chief priests, that    Jesus said to them, “All of you will be
