                    20  The watchman said, “He came to on the horses. Then he trampled her under
                  them, and isn’t coming back. The driving is  foot.  34 When he had come in, he ate and
                  like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, drank. Then he said, “See now to this
                  for he drives furiously.”                   cursed woman, and bury her; for she is a

                    They got his chariot ready. Then Joram      35 They went to bury her, but they found
                  king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah    no more of her than the skull, the feet, and
                  went out, each in his chariot; and they     the palms of her hands.  36 Therefore they
                  went out to meet Jehu, and found him        came back, and told him.
                                                                He said, “This is Yahweh’s word, which

                  said to Ahaziah, “This is treason, Ahaziah!”  they won’t say, “This is Jezebel.” ’ ”
                    24  Jehu drew his bow with his full
                  strength, and struck Joram between his                         10
                  arms; and the arrow went out at his heart,    1 Now Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.
                  and he sunk down in his chariot.  25  Then  Jehu wrote letters and sent them to
                  Jehu said to Bidkar his captain, “Pick him Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, even the
                  up, and throw him in the plot of the field of elders, and to those who brought up Ahab’s
                  Naboth the Jezreelite; for remember how, sons, saying, “Now as soon as this letter

                  when you and I rode together after Ahab comes to you, since your master’s sons
                  his father, Yahweh laid this burden on him: are with you, and you have chariots and
                  26  ‘Surely I have seen yesterday the blood horses, a fortified city also, and armor,
                  of Naboth, and the blood of his sons,’ says  3 select the best and fittest of your master’s
                  Yahweh; ‘and I will repay you in this plot sons, set him on his father’s throne, and

                  take and cast him onto the plot of ground,    4  But they were exceedingly afraid, and
                  according to Yahweh’s word.”                said, “Behold, the two kings didn’t stand
                    27  But when Ahaziah the king of Judah before him! How then shall we stand?”
                  saw this, he fled by the way of the garden  5  He who was over the household, and he
                  house. Jehu followed after him, and said,   who was over the city, the elders also, and
                  “Strike him also in the chariot!”    They   those who raised the children, sent to Jehu,
                  struck him at the ascent of Gur, which is   saying, “We are your servants, and will do
                  by Ibleam. He fled to Megiddo, and died     all that you ask us. We will not make any
                  there.  28  His servants carried him in a   man king. You do that which is good in
                  chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his your eyes.”
                  tomb with his fathers in David’s city.  29 In  6 Then he wrote a letter the second time
                  the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, to them, saying, “If you are on my side, and
                  Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.          if you will listen to my voice, take the heads
                    30  When Jehu had come to Jezreel,        of the men who are your master’s sons, and
                  Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this

                  at the window.   31  As Jehu entered in at    Now the king’s sons, being seventy per-
                  the gate, she said, “Do you come in peace,  sons, were with the great men of the city,
                  Zimri, you murderer of your master?”        who brought them up.    7  When the letter
                    32  He lifted up his face to the window,  came to them, they took the king’s sons
                  and said, “Who is on my side? Who?”         and killed them, even seventy people, and
                    Two or three eunuchs looked out at him.   put their heads in baskets, and sent them
                                                                               8
                    33 He said, “Throw her down!”             to him to Jezreel. A messenger came and
                    So they threw her down; and some of told him, “They have brought the heads of
