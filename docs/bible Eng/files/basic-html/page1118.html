                    12 Then they asked him, “Who is the man done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.
                  who said to you, ‘Take up your mat and      30  I can of myself do nothing. As I hear,
                  walk’?”                                     I judge; and my judgment is righteous,
                    13  But he who was healed didn’t know because I don’t seek my own will, but the
                  who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, a      will of my Father who sent me.
                  crowd being in the place.                     31  “If I testify about myself, my witness
                    14 Afterward Jesus found him in the tem- is not valid.  32  It is another who testifies
                  ple and said to him, “Behold, you are made about me. I know that the testimony which
                  well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse he testifies about me is true.        33  You
                  happens to you.”                            have sent to John, and he has testified to
                    15  The man went away, and told the       the truth.  34  But the testimony which I
                  Jews that it was Jesus who had made him     receive is not from man. However, I say
                  well.  16 For this cause the Jews persecuted  these things that you may be saved.  35 He
                  Jesus and sought to kill him, because he    was the burning and shining lamp, and you
                  did these things on the Sabbath.    17  But  were willing to rejoice for a while in his
                  Jesus answered them, “My Father is still    light.  36  But the testimony which I have
                  working, so I am working, too.”             is greater than that of John; for the works
                    18  For this cause therefore the Jews     which the Father gave me to accomplish,
                  sought all the more to kill him, because he  the very works that I do, testify about me,
                                                                                          37
                  not only broke the Sabbath, but also called  that the Father has sent me.  The Father
                                                              himself, who sent me, has testified about
                  God his own Father, making himself equal    me. You have neither heard his voice at
                  with God.    19  Jesus therefore answered any time, nor seen his form.   38  You don’t
                  them, “Most certainly, I tell you, the Son have his word living in you, because you
                  can do nothing of himself, but what he don’t believe him whom he sent.
                  sees the Father doing. For whatever things    39  “You search the Scriptures, because
                  he does, these the Son also does likewise. you think that in them you have eternal
                  20  For the Father has affection for the Son, life; and these are they which testify about
                  and shows him all things that he himself    me.  40 Yet you will not come to me, that
                  does. He will show him greater works than   you may have life.  41 I don’t receive glory
                  these, that you may marvel.   21  For as the  from men.  42  But I know you, that you

                  even so the Son also gives life to whom he  have come in my Father’s name, and you
                  desires.  22  For the Father judges no one,  don’t receive me. If another comes in his
                  but he has given all judgment to the Son, own name, you will receive him.     44 How
                  23 that all may honor the Son, even as they can you believe, who receive glory from
                  honor the Father. He who doesn’t honor one another, and you don’t seek the glory
                  the Son doesn’t honor the Father who sent   that comes from the only God?
                  him.                                          45
                    24  “Most certainly I tell you, he who        “Don’t think that I will accuse you to

                  judgment, but has passed out of death into  hope.   46  For if you believed Moses, you
                  life.  25 Most certainly I tell you, the hour  would believe me; for he wrote about me.
                                                                But if you don’t believe his writings, how
                                                              47
                  comes, and now is, when the dead will hear
                  the Son of God’s voice; and those who hear  will you believe my words?”
                  will live.  26  For as the Father has life in
                  himself, even so he gave to the Son also to                    6

                  the hour comes in which all who are in the  multitude followed him, because they saw
