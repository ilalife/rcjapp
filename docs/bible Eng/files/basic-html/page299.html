                    Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is       17  Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your
                  staying in Jerusalem; for he said, ‘Today kindness to your friend? Why didn’t you

                  came out, whose name was Shimei, the son      20  Then Absalom said to Ahithophel,
                  of Gera. He came out and cursed as he “Give your counsel what we shall do.”
                  came.   6  He cast stones at David and at     21  Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to

                  people and all the mighty men were on his   keep the house. Then all Israel will hear
                  right hand and on his left.  7  Shimei said  that you are abhorred by your father. Then
                  when he cursed, “Be gone, be gone, you      the hands of all who are with you will be

                  Yahweh has delivered the kingdom into       the top of the house, and Absalom went in
                  the hand of Absalom your son! Behold, you   to his father’s concubines in the sight of all

                    9 Then Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to  at the inner sanctuary of God. All the

                  “What have I to do with you, you sons of                       17
                  Zeruiah? Because he curses, and because       1 Moreover Ahithophel said to Absalom,
                  Yahweh has said to him, ‘Curse David,’ who “Let me now choose twelve thousand men,
                  then shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’ ”   and I will arise and pursue after David

                    11  David said to Abishai and to all his  tonight.  2 I will come on him while he is
                  servants, “Behold, my son, who came out weary and exhausted, and will make him
                  of my bowels, seeks my life. How much afraid. All the people who are with him will

                  alone, and let him curse; for Yahweh has bring back all the people to you. The man
                  invited him.  12 It may be that Yahweh will whom you seek is as if all returned. All the
                  look on the wrong done to me, and that people shall be in peace.”
                  Yahweh will repay me good for the cursing     4  The saying pleased Absalom well, and
                  of me today.”   13  So David and his men    all the elders of Israel. Then Absalom said,
                                                                                   5
                  went by the way; and Shimei went along on “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let’s
                  the hillside opposite him and cursed as he hear likewise what he says.”
                  went, threw stones at him, and threw dust.    6  When Hushai had come to Absalom,
                  14  The king and all the people who were Absalom spoke to him, saying, “Ahithophel
                  with him arrived weary; and he refreshed has spoken like this. Shall we do what he
                  himself there.                              says? If not, speak up.”
                    15 Absalom and all the people, the men of   7  Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel

                  Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the mighty men, and they are fierce in their
