                  where was it from? From heaven or from out the vineyard to other farmers who will
                  men?”                                       give him the fruit in its season.”
                    They reasoned with themselves, saying,      42 Jesus said to them, “Did you never read
                  “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will ask      in the Scriptures,
                  us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’     ‘The stone which the builders rejected

                  multitude, for all hold John as a prophet.”  This was from the Lord.
                  27 They answered Jesus, and said, “We don’t     It is marvelous in our eyes’? ✡
                  know.”                                        43  “Therefore I tell you, God’s Kingdom
                    He also said to them, “Neither will I tell  will be taken away from you and will be
                  you by what authority I do these things.    given to a nation producing its fruit.  44 He
                  28  But what do you think? A man had two    who falls on this stone will be broken to
                  sons, and he came to the first, and said,   pieces, but on whomever it will fall, it will
                  ‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’  29 He  scatter him as dust.”
                  answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he      45  When the chief priests and the Phar-
                  changed his mind, and went.    30  He came  isees heard his parables, they perceived
                  to the second, and said the same thing.     that he spoke about them.   46  When they
                  He answered, ‘I’m going, sir,’ but he didn’t  sought to seize him, they feared the mul-
                  go.  31 Which of the two did the will of his  titudes, because they considered him to be
                  father?”                                    a prophet.
                    They said to him, “The first.”
                    Jesus said to them, “Most certainly I tell                   22

                  before you.   32  For John came to you in of Heaven is like a certain king, who made
                  the way of righteousness, and you didn’t a wedding feast for his son,   3 and sent out
                  believe him; but the tax collectors and the his servants to call those who were invited
                  prostitutes believed him. When you saw it, to the wedding feast, but they would not
                  you didn’t even repent afterward, that you come.   4 Again he sent out other servants,
                  might believe him.                          saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “Be-

                  man who was a master of a household who and my fatlings are killed, and all things
                  planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it,   are ready. Come to the wedding feast!” ’
                  dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased  5  But they made light of it, and went their
                  it out to farmers, and went into another    ways, one to his own farm, another to
                  country.     34  When the season for the    his merchandise;  6  and the rest grabbed
                  fruit came near, he sent his servants to the  his servants, treated them shamefully, and
                  farmers to receive his fruit.  35 The farmers                7
                  took his servants, beat one, killed another,  killed them.     When the king heard
                  and stoned another.     36  Again, he sent  that, he was angry, and sent his armies,
                  other servants more than the first; and     destroyed those murderers, and burned
                  they treated them the same way.     37  But their city.
                  afterward he sent to them his son, say-       8 “Then he said to his servants, ‘The wed-

                  the farmers, when they saw the son, said weren’t worthy.       9  Go therefore to the
                  among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, intersections of the highways, and as many

                  39  So they took him and threw him out of feast.’  10 Those servants went out into the
