                                                                20  He declared, and didn’t deny, but he
                                                              declared, “I am not the Christ.”
                    The Good News According to                  21 They asked him, “What then? Are you
                                   John                       Elijah?”
                                                                He said, “I am not.”
                    1  In the beginning was the Word, and       “Are you the prophet?”
                  the Word was with God, and the Word was       He answered, “No.”
                       2
                  God. The same was in the beginning with       22  They said therefore to him, “Who are
                       3
                  God. All things were made through him.      you? Give us an answer to take back to
                  Without him, nothing was made that has      those who sent us. What do you say about
                  been made.   4  In him was life, and the life  yourself?”
                  was the light of men.   5  The light shines   23  He said, “I am the voice of one crying
                  in the darkness, and the darkness hasn’t in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way
                  overcome * it.                              of the Lord,’ ✡ as Isaiah the prophet said.”
                    6  There came a man sent from God,          24 Theoneswhohadbeensentwerefrom
                                         7
                  whose name was John. The same came as       the Pharisees.  25  They asked him, “Why
                  a witness, that he might testify about the  then do you baptize if you are not the
                  light, that all might believe through him.  Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?”
                  8  He was not the light, but was sent that    26  John answered them, “I baptize in
                  he might testify about the light. The true  water, but among you stands one whom
                                                  9
                  light that enlightens everyone was coming   you don’t know.    27  He is the one who
                  into the world.                             comes after me, who is preferred before
                    10 He was in the world, and the world was
                  made through him, and the world didn’t      me, whose sandal strap I’m not worthy
                  recognize him.  11 He came to his own, and  to loosen.”  28  These things were done in
                  those who were his own didn’t receive him.  Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John
                  12 But as many as received him, to them he  was baptizing.
                  gave the right to become God’s children, to   29  The next day, he saw Jesus coming to
                  those who believe in his name:  13 who were him, and said, “Behold, † the Lamb of God,
                  born, not of blood, nor of the will of the who takes away the sin of the world!  30 This
                  flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.  is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a
                    14  The Word became flesh and lived       man who is preferred before me, for he was
                  among us. We saw his glory, such glory      before me.’  31  I didn’t know him, but for
                  as of the only born † Son of the Father, this reason I came baptizing in water, that
                  full of grace and truth.  15  John testified he would be revealed to Israel.”  32  John
                  about him. He cried out, saying, “This testified, saying, “I have seen the Spirit
                  was he of whom I said, ‘He who comes descending like a dove out of heaven, and it
                  after me has surpassed me, for he was remained on him.       33 I didn’t recognize him,
                  before me.’ ”  16  From his fullness we all but he who sent me to baptize in water
                  received grace upon grace.  17  For the law  said to me, ‘On whomever you will see the
                  was given through Moses. Grace and truth    Spirit descending and remaining on him is
                  were realized through Jesus Christ. ‡ 18 No  he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.’  34  I
                  one has seen God at any time. The only      have seen and have testified that this is the
                  born § Son, * who is in the bosom of the Son of God.”
                  Father, has declared him.                     35 Again, the next day, John was standing
                                                                                     36
                    19  This is John’s testimony, when with two of his disciples, and he looked at
                  the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jesus as he walked, and said, “Behold, the
                  Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?”        Lamb of God!”  37  The two disciples heard

                  * 1:5 The word translated “overcome” (κατέλαβεν) can also be translated “comprehended.” It refers to getting a
                  grip on an enemy to defeat him.  † 1:14 The phrase “only born” is from the Greek word “μονογενους”, which is
                  sometimes translated “only begotten” or “one and only”.  ‡ 1:17 “Christ” means “Anointed One”.  § 1:18 The
                  phrase “only born” is from the Greek word “μονογενη”, which is sometimes translated “only begotten” or “one and
                  only”. * 1:18 NU reads “God” ✡ 1:23 Isaiah 40:3 † 1:29 “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice,
                  observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.</code></pre>
