                  perceived that one event happens to them    3 a time to kill,
                  all.  15  Then I said in my heart, “As it       and a time to heal;
                  happens to the fool, so will it happen even  a time to break down,
                                                                  and a time to build up;
                  to me; and why was I then more wise?”       4
                  Then I said in my heart that this also is    a time to weep,
                                                                  and a time to laugh;
                  vanity.  16 For of the wise man, even as of  a time to mourn,
                  the fool, there is no memory forever, since     and a time to dance;
                  in the days to come all will have been long  5 a time to cast away stones,
                  forgotten. Indeed, the wise man must die        and a time to gather stones together;
                  just like the fool!                         a time to embrace,
                    17  So I hated life, because the work that    and a time to refrain from embracing;
                  is worked under the sun was grievous to     6 a time to seek,
                  me; for all is vanity and a chasing after       and a time to lose;
                  wind.   18  I hated all my labor in which   a time to keep,
                  I labored under the sun, because I must         and a time to cast away;
                  leave it to the man who comes after me.     7 a time to tear,
                  19  Who knows whether he will be a wise         and a time to sew;
                  man or a fool? Yet he will have rule over   a time to keep silence,
                  all of my labor in which I have labored, and    and a time to speak;
                  in which I have shown myself wise under     8 a time to love,
                  the sun. This also is vanity.                   and a time to hate;
                    20 Therefore I began to cause my heart to  a time for war,
                                                                  and a time for peace.

                  I had labored under the sun.  21  For there  in which he labors?  10  I have seen the
                  is a man whose labor is with wisdom, with   burden which God has given to the sons of
                  knowledge, and with skillfulness; yet he                              11
                  shall leave it for his portion to a man who  men to be afflicted with.  He has made

                  have of all his labor and of the striving   done from the beginning even to the end.

                  his travail is grief; yes, even in the night  long as they live.  13  Also that every man

                  saw, that it is from the hand of God.  25 For  taken from it; and God has done it, that
                  who can eat, or who can have enjoyment,     men should fear before him.  15 That which
                  more than I? 26 For to the man who pleases  is has been long ago, and that which is to
                  him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and       be has been long ago. God seeks again that

                                                              heart, “God will judge the righteous and
