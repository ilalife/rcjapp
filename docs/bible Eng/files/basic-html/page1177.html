                  were made dead to the law through the ferent law in my members, warring against
                  body of Christ, that you would be joined the law of my mind, and bringing me into
                  to another, to him who was raised from captivity under the law of sin which is in
                  the dead, that we might produce fruit to    my members.    24  What a wretched man I

                  the sinful passions which were through the  of this death?  25 I thank God through Jesus
                  law worked in our members to bring out      Christ, our Lord! So then with the mind, I
                  fruit to death.  6  But now we have been    myself serve God’s law, but with the flesh,
                  discharged from the law, having died to     sin’s law.
                  that in which we were held; so that we
                  serve in newness of the spirit, and not in                     8
                  oldness of the letter.                        1  There is therefore now no condem-
                    7  What shall we say then? Is the law     nation to those who are in Christ Jesus,
                  sin? May it never be! However, I wouldn’t   who don’t walk according to the flesh, but
                  have known sin except through the law.      according to the Spirit. * 2  For the law of
                  For I wouldn’t have known coveting unless   the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus made me
                  the law had said, “You shall not covet.” ✡  free from the law of sin and of death. For

                  commandment, produced in me all kinds       weak through the flesh, God did, sending
                  of coveting. For apart from the law, sin    his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh
                  is dead.  9  I was alive apart from the law and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,
                  once, but when the commandment came,        4  that the ordinance of the law might be
                  sin revived and I died.  10  The command- fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh,
                  ment which was for life, this I found to but after the Spirit.   5  For those who live
                  be for death;  11  for sin, finding occasion  according to the flesh set their minds on
                  through the commandment, deceived me,       the things of the flesh, but those who live
                  and through it killed me.  12 Therefore the  according to the Spirit, the things of the
                  law indeed is holy, and the commandment     Spirit. For the mind of the flesh is death,

                  holy, righteous, and good.                  but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace;

                  that through the commandment sin might        9  But you are not in the flesh but in the
