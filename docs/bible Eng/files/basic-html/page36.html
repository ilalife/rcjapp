                  grieved, and they were very angry, because    24  All who went out of the gate of his

                    11 Shechem said to her father and to her went away.    27  Jacob’s sons came on the
                  brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, dead, and plundered the city, because they

                  didn’t wait to do this thing, because he had to all who were with him, “Put away the
