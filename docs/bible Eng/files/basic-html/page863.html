                  Jerusalem,  7  when the king of Babylon’s a liberty,” says Yahweh, “to the sword,
                  army was fighting against Jerusalem and to the pestilence, and to the famine. I

                  left, against Lachish and against Azekah; among all the kingdoms of the earth.    18  I

                  Judah as fortified cities.                  my covenant, who have not performed the
                    8 The word came to Jeremiah from Yah- words of the covenant which they made
                  weh, after King Zedekiah had made a before me when they cut the calf in two
                  covenant with all the people who were and passed between its parts:     19 the princes
                  at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them, of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the
                  9  that every man should let his male ser- eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of
                  vant, and every man his female servant, the land, who passed between the parts of
                  who is a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free, the calf.   20  I will even give them into the
                  that no one should make bondservants of hand of their enemies and into the hand
                  them, of a Jew his brother.     10  All the of those who seek their life. Their dead
                  princes and all the people obeyed who had bodies will be food for the birds of the sky
                  entered into the covenant, that everyone and for the animals of the earth.
                  should let his male servant and everyone      21  “I will give Zedekiah king of Judah
                  his female servant go free, that no one and his princes into the hands of their
                  should make bondservants of them any enemies, into the hands of those who seek
                  more. They obeyed and let them go,  11 but  their life and into the hands of the king
                  afterwards they turned, and caused the      of Babylon’s army, who has gone away
                  servants and the handmaids whom they        from you.  22 Behold, I will command,” says
                  had let go free to return, and brought      Yahweh, “and cause them to return to this
                                                              city. They will fight against it, take it, and

                  handmaids.                                  Judah a desolation, without inhabitant.”
                    12  Therefore Yahweh’s word came
                  to   Jeremiah   from   Yahweh,     saying,                     35

                  a covenant with your fathers in the day     Yahweh in the days of Jehoiakim the son
                  that I brought them out of the land of      of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,  2  “Go to
                  Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying:  the house of the Rechabites, and speak
                  14  At the end of seven years, every man    to them, and bring them into Yahweh’s
                  of you shall release his brother who is a   house, into one of the rooms, and give
                  Hebrew, who has been sold to you, and       them wine to drink.”
                  has served you six years. You shall let       3  Then I took Jaazaniah the son of
                  him go free from you. But your fathers      Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, with his
                  didn’t listen to me, and didn’t incline their  brothers, all his sons, and the whole house
                  ear.  15 You had now turned, and had done   of the Rechabites;  4  and I brought them
                  that which is right in my eyes, in every    into Yahweh’s house, into the room of the
                  man proclaiming liberty to his neighbor.    sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the
                  You had made a covenant before me in the    man of God, which was by the room of
                  house which is called by my name;   16  but
                  you turned and profaned my name, and        the princes, which was above the room of
                  every man caused his servant and every      Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of
                                                                            5
                  man his handmaid, whom you had let          the threshold. I set before the sons of the
                                                              house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine,
                  go free at their pleasure, to return. You   and cups; and I said to them, “Drink wine!”
                  brought them into subjection, to be to you    6  But they said, “We will drink no wine;
                  for servants and for handmaids.’ ”          for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father,
                    17  Therefore Yahweh says: “You have      commanded us, saying, ‘You shall drink
                  not listened to me, to proclaim liberty,    no wine, neither you nor your children,
                  every man to his brother, and every man     forever. You shall not build a house, sow
