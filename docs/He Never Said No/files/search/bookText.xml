                                                        (English Edition)



                     On May 16, 2004, during a very solemn celebration in St. Peter’s Square, John Paul II
               declared Father Hannibal Mary Di Francia a Saint. It was the worthy conclusion of the long
               journey of love for God and neighbor, especially the poor and the little ones, and of dedication
               to the prayer for good laborers for the Lord’s harvest, that Father Hannibal had started more
               than 150 years ago in Messina (Italy).

                     Hannibal Mary Di Francia lived for God forgetting himself to serve others. He is a model
               for our times, for the youth, priests, consecrated, lay, teachers, social workers, etc., and for all
               who are in love with humankind.
                     For many years, Father Hannibal had hardly been known in the Church, and much less
               in society, in Italy and abroad. It was St. Luigi Orione who woke up the Rogationists, urging
               them to produce at least a biography in order to bring this great hero of charity and the Rogate
               to the forefront.
                     In 1939, Fr. Francesco Vitale, one of the first collaborators of Father Hannibal and his
               immediate successor in the governance of the Rogationists, published a biography written with
               historical objectivity and the affection of a son. ‘Canon Hannibal M. Di Francia in His Life
               and Works’ - that is the title - is a thick volume of more than 700 pages, which has been
               translated into several languages.
                     However,  as  the  fame  of  the  sanctity  of  Father  Hannibal  increased,  many  more
               biographers  wrote  about  him  from  different  points  of  view  and  according  to  the  varying
                                                         1
               perceptions and expectations of their times.
                     One of them is Fr. Teodoro Tusino, a Rogationist who had been with Father Hannibal for
               16 years and in 1966, wrote this biography entitled “He Never Said No”. Fr. Tusino was no
               ordinary writer. As the Postulator of the Cause of Canonization of Father Hannibal, he had
               access to all the documents and archives. He read all the approximately 14,000 pages of Father
               Hannibal’s Writings and until his last days, he wrote extensively about “the Father”.
                     In  this  work,  Fr.  Tusino  gives  us  many  details  coming  from  his  closeness  with  the
               Founder  and  from  ‘touching’  his  sanctity.  Fr.  Tusino’s  filial  devotion  to  St.  Hannibal  and
               intense effort in handing on his heritage to us as faithfully as possible is evident and admirable.

                     According to Fr. Tusino himself, this biography “wants to highlight the spirit of Father
               Hannibal,  especially  in  connection  with  his  twofold  mission  as  Apostle  of  the  Rogate  in
               spreading the prayer for vocations, and as Apostle of Charity in serving the poor and the

               considering the times and the fact that it was just a biography of a Saint-to-be, is already
               something great. It has also been translated and printed in other languages.
                     The English translation is overdue. Fr. Gapare Gallitto, former Superior of the Philippine-
               Indian Delegation and Novice Master, wanted it to have a simple, handy, and reliable approach
               to the Founder, accessible to our seminarians and friends. This is, therefore, the purpose of this
               work, which I cordially dedicate to his memory.
                       Allow  me  also  to  thank  my  family  and  the  Rogationist  Community  of  Desenzano.
               During my sickness, they provided me with the ideal places and support for this work. A big
               thanks also to the Editor, Mrs. Cherry Aquino, to the General Editor, Fr. Jose Maria Ezpeleta
               RCJ, and to the General Commission on Translations.
                     Let me close with Fr. Tusino’s words, “If we were successful in doing this, let the Lord
               and Our Lady be praised; if we failed, kindly bear it with us.”

               -  The term ‘Servant of God’ has been translated usually with: ‘Father Hannibal’, ‘Father Di
                   Francia’, ‘young Hannibal’, ‘the Father’, ‘Father Founder’ and similar;

               -  As much as possible, the proper names have been retained in their original spelling to avoid
                   confusion. Except for Father Hannibal and some internationally acknowledged names of
                   places (Rome, Naples, Apulia, etc.) and of Saints (St. Francis, St. Anthony, St. Francis de
                   Sales, etc.), the proper Italian names have been kept as they are in the original text.

               -  An Epilogue and Chronology of the process of canonization of St. Hannibal have been
                   added;

               -  [EN] = Editor’s Note. Explanation added by the General Editor.
               -  Often, the word “anima” is translated with “person” instead of “soul”;

               -  The footnotes had some minor modifications.
               -  Some titles of the Chapters and the body have been slightly modified.
               -  The Italian currency at the time of Father Hannibal was Lira (pl. Lire). Just to give a sample,
                   10 Lire of 1890 would correspond to 42.35 Euros today.

                    I received the appreciated gift of the biography of Father Hannibal M. Di Francia, that you
               have willingly sent to me.
                    While thanking you for the sign of attention toward me, I wish to congratulate the author
               for the simplicity and objectivity with which he managed to outline the life, work, and spirit of
               Father Hannibal.

                    Together with the previous biographies, some of which are of considerable historical-
               literary value, this book has the advantage of presenting briefly and with the proper sensibility
               of all the characteristics of the spirituality of Father Di Francia.
                    I heartily wish that the effort of the author be rewarded by the wide dissemination of this
               work. This will be a means not only to make Father Hannibal known but also to continue his
               apostolate in favor of priestly vocations.
                    Please accept my special regards.

                    Reverend Father,

                    By forwarding to me the life of the holy Founder of the Rogationists written by Fr. Tusino,
               you  have  given  me  a  truly  beautiful  gift.  The  Father  of  the  Orphans  and  the  Apostle  of
               Vocations comes to life again in the pages of Fr. Tusino, in a vibrant, dynamic, and enjoyable
               way.
                    The book of Fr. Tusino can be read all in one go because of the easy and lively style but
               even more for the interesting content, that gives a wonderful testimony on the sanctity of Father
               Di Francia.
                    While expressing again my gratitude for this book, I wish that the cause of the beatification
               of Father Hannibal may soon reach its happy conclusion.
                    Very Reverend Father, please accept my distinguished respects and pray for me to the
               Lord.

                                               HANNIBAL’S YOUTH



               1. The First and Last Encounter

                       August 20, 1911: on a train, bound for Brindisi slowly treading the railway along the
               Adriatic Sea.
                       We were nine boys. Father Di Francia had picked us up in Bisceglie and was taking us
               to his San Pasquale Institute in Oria.
                       I was the youngest in the group and years later, the Father liked to recall that trip for
               the memory he kept of my vivacity. “You were so small,” and gesturing with his hand, “so
               small, and during the entire journey you laughed, and laughed...”
                       This was not, certainly, a statement that makes me proud but, that entire day, the first I
               spent with the Father, left an indelible memory that is of an entirely different nature.
                       As the train started moving, he asked me, “Tell me, how much do you love Jesus?”
                       I was embarrassed and stammered, “I love Him as much as I can.”
                       He insisted, “Yet, how much do you want to love Him?”
                       I don’t remember what I answered. I just recall that, after addressing the same question
               to all, he added, “I want to love Jesus with the love of all the Angels and Saints in heaven and
               of all the righteous people on earth, with the love of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, and finally
               with the same love of His Divine Father!”
                       Then he explained, “Surely, it is impossible to go as far as that, but what does it matter?
               Jesus appreciates holy desires; he is pleased with them and increases the ardor of His love in
               our soul!”
                       Such  a  conversation  was  entirely  new  to  me,  as  well  as  the  fact  that  our  trip  was
               continuously peppered with prayers and rosaries. As we approached the different villages,
               Father Hannibal reached for the window, and looking at the Church, said, “Look! Jesus is there,
               maybe at this time He is alone, abandoned...” I remember very well, however, that we did not
               get bored, and he knew how to catch our attention with saintly talks. For instance, he narrated
               the life of the Abbot San Barsanofio, the protector of Oria. He told us about the San Pasquale
               Institute and so on.
                       Suddenly, I interrupted him, “Father, I am thirsty!”
                       In those days, trains did not have the comforts they offer nowadays, and since the
               Apulian Aqueduct was still to come, water was bought by the glassful in the shops. Smiling,
               the Father turned to me and said, “Now, Jesus drinks in your heart. When we reach Brindisi,
               Jesus will give you something to drink.”
                       This was also a new kind of language to me, and I was staring at him as if to say,
               “Meanwhile, however, we have no water!” Lovingly the Father replied, “Don’t you trust me?
               Listen. Offer your thirst to Jesus, it would be as if you had offered Him water when He was
               asking for it on the Cross!”
                       The speech was perfect; and from all I saw and observed during the trip, a thought was
               taking shape in my little childish head, “This priest is truly a holy man!” This thought ripened
               progressively into a firm conviction during the 16 years I spent following him.

                       For about twenty days, the Father had been in La Guardia, a village on the outskirts of
               Messina, where we hoped he could regain his already worn out health.
                       Early that morning, I had brought him Holy Communion, and after the Mass, I went to
               say goodbye before returning to the city. I found him seated in his old wicker chair.
                       “How are you, Father?”
                       “Like a fallen tree,” he answered, with a tone of voice and a flash in the eyes where I
               could see that, though in full abandon to the divine will, the nostalgia of the past when the
               sturdy tree could defy winds and storms was still alive. He continued, “Let God handle things.
               God knows what He is doing. God knows what He is doing! I bless you.” and he raised his
               fatherly hand over my head.
                       That was his last lesson and blessing that I keep deeply engraved in my soul, and that
               comes along with me in the alternating vicissitudes of life, until the infinite mercy of God will
               open the doors of a blessed eternity for me.
                       May that blessing help me in writing these short memories.


               2. At San Nicolò Boarding House

                       Father Hannibal Mary Di Francia was the apostle of prayer for priestly and religious
               vocations, an apostle of charity, especially for the abandoned orphans, and an apostle of the
               devotion to St. Anthony of Padua.

                       He was born in Messina on July 5, 1851, Saturday, to Knight Francesco, Marquis of
               Santa Caterina, appointed Vice-Consul and Honorary Captain of the Navy by Pope Pius IX,
               and, on his mother’s side, to Lady Anna Toscano of the Marquises of Montonaro.
                       Hannibal’s father died when he was not yet two, so the little boy had a lonely and sad
               infancy since his mother, busy taking care of the fast diminishing family inheritance, could not
               take  care  of  him  personally.  Thus,  she  entrusted  him  to  an  old  aunt  who  lived  alone  in  a
               secluded environment more suited to stifle the liveliness of a child. The Divine Providence
               used this moral and physical suffering to put into Hannibal’s still young mind the seed of that
               incomparable tenderness towards the little and abandoned ones, which characterized his life.
                       When  he  was  seven,  he  was  placed  in  the  Boarding  House  of  ‘San  Nicolò  dei
               Gentiluomini’, run by the Cistercian Monks. There, while opening his mind to the basics of
               learning, he warmed up his heart with the fire of devotion. Hannibal remembered forever the
               good Fr. Foti who accompanied him every evening to an image of Our Lady to recite together
                                                      2
               a prayer to the Immaculate Conception,  and with his talks and examples developed the ardor
                                         3
               of love for the Holy Virgin  in him.

                  2
                    The prayer was the “Stellario” to the Virgin Mary, a Chaplet of prayers to Mary.
                  3  In the edifying biography of Francesco Di Francia, Father Hannibal’s brother, (FELICI, The Father of the
               Orphan Girls, Mons. Francesco Di Francia and his Institute, Rome) the Author, Icilio Felici, associates Francesco
               with  Hannibal  in  this  stay  with  the  strange  and  misanthropic  aunt  and  then  in  the  Boarding  House  of  the
               Cistercians. I have no evidence of this. I have arguments that seem to support the contrary. Speaking of his childish
               fears in connection with the aunt, Hannibal, who remembered with formidable clarity the persons and events of
               that time, never mentioned his brother.
                  I agree with Felici that Mrs. Toscano, having necessarily to defend the family’s assets, could not deal with the
               lawyers’ offices and courtrooms carrying in her arms the little Francesco. However, there was not only the gloomy
               aunt among her relatives. Fr. Vitale reasonably writes that Mrs. Toscano ‘thought of entrusting the smallest of the

               young Hannibal’s concern toward the poor was great, and from early childhood, he had a real
               concern for the poor. He would give them any food or object he could collect in the House.



               3. The Embrace of the Poor


                       A story related to Hannibal’s years in the Boarding House was reported to us.
                       A poor man had been allowed to the refectory of the boys. In a corner, while eating the
               food given to him, he became the object of the rudeness of some mischievous boys who, with
               jeers and lack of respect at first, and then by tossing fruit peels, stumps, and leftovers from the
               table, forced him to leave the room humiliated. The young Hannibal could not stand this sight.
               He collected bread, cheese, and fruits in a basket, and ran to give it to the poor man who was
               leaving. The old man embraced and kissed him with tears in his eyes.
                       After the 1860 revolution, Mrs. Toscano left Messina and went to Naples to find shelter
               in the house of some relatives, with the young Hannibal wearing the white “Cistercian” habit.
                       There, the cleaning woman smiled and said to him, “Puozza ‘mbiri ‘nto calici!” (“May
               you drink from the Chalice!” which implies “May you become a priest!”). Father Hannibal
               was always pleased to remember how God fulfilled the wish of that good woman.



               4. Following a Poet

                       At fifteen, Hannibal left the Boarding House, closed permanently by the anticlerical
               legislation of that time, and continued his studies under the guidance of the renowned poet of
               Messina, Felice Bisazza.
                       Hannibal was born a poet. Later, we will talk about his poetic skills and works. Had he
               had  the  time  and  ways  to  cultivate  his  natural  talents,  certainly  he  could  have  earned
               recognitions in the field of poetry. He preferred instead to gather them in the field of charity.
               Isn’t charity the highest form of poetry?



               5. The Apostolate of Print Media

                       One  of  Hannibal’s  uncles  was  the  director  of  “The  Catholic  Word”  (La  Parola
               Cattolica), a courageous weekly newspaper that openly defended the faith and the cause of the
               Papacy to the extent of going through several sequestrations and even one-year suspension,
               from 1866 to 1867, for its strong stand for the Catholic cause.



               children to relatives. I believe that Francesco was luckier than Hannibal and did not suffer the vagaries of the old
               hysterical aunt who, moreover, died soon during the 1854 cholera epidemic.
                  When it comes to the permanence of the young Hannibal in the Boarding House, for historical accuracy, we
               must distinguish two periods. The first ends with the entrance of Garibaldi in Messina, on July 24, 1860, when
               Mrs. Toscano and her children found shelter with her relatives in Naples. After the revolution, Hannibal returned
               to San Nicolò, and remained there until its suppression in 1866. During this second period, he had his younger
               brother Francesco as a companion in the boarding school.

               always his passion.
                       On June 2, 1868, he published a poem - a Sapphic ode - entitled “For the Virgin Mary”.

                       Let me sing to you on your starry throne,
                       Embittered in the springtime of my life
                       Since of a holy and unblemished suffering
                           I drunk the pains.
                       …

                       Farewell, youthful dreams! Farewell, happy
                       Illusions of my mind, I cried out,
                       Which, in the fervor of my early age,
                       Inebriated, I dreamt.

                       We perceive a personality full of devotion and fervor, but it is always a young man with
               anxieties and problems.
                       As a poet, he continues by noting the sadness of the times, the violence of the struggle
               between good and evil, which was tearing Italy apart, and announces the salvation that will
               come from Our Lady. However, how will Our Lady triumph?
                       The poet, we repeat, was a young man; and youth, even the saints or those who ... might
               be future saints, belong more or less, to the fiery family of the sons of thunder (Mk 3:17),
               which, like James and John, speak of fire from heaven. Thus, he ends:

                              Woman and Queen from your eternal Throne,
                              Strike down the wicked from your highest heaven!

                       At this point, I see the holy Virgin Mary bending over the ardent Hannibal to whisper
               in his ears her Divine Son’s words, applying them to Herself, “You do not know which spirit
               you belong to: my mission is not to lose people but to save them.” The young Hannibal heard
               this call, and on the newspaper that he kept for himself, he corrected it in his handwriting:
                                 Convert the wicked from your highest heaven!


               6. Justice for the Innocent


                       His first article, dated November 26 of the same year 1868, was entitled “Justice for the
               Innocent”.

                       It is meaningful that, in his first article, the future apostle of the “Rogate” revealed
               himself as a defender of priests. The subject was the defense of two priests, the Director and a
               collaborator of The Iblea’s Bee, a Catholic newspaper of Palermo. Because of the prevailing
               sectarian spirit of that time, without any valid reason, the two were arrested and imprisoned.
               “They are guilty only of having stood by the principles of their Catholic faith in a free city. In
               front of civilized Europe, we cannot refrain from denouncing an event which is sufficient to
               show  the  immorality  and  bigotry  of  our  legislators.”  Then  he  concluded,  “What  are  they
               thinking? That they can force us into silence by these arbitrary acts? They are greatly mistaken!

               grants us to uncover always your plots as mean persons and enemies of the Catholic faith. We

               shall remain buried in it.”
                       Apart from the rhetorical emphasis and the conclusion, we cannot but admire the zeal,
               frankness, and courage of this young man, who was only seventeen, in supporting his ideas in
               defense of religion.
                       In 1869, he also published a poem in honor of Pius IX, who on April 11, celebrated his
               priestly golden Jubilee.



               5. A Well Delivered Slap

                       The apostolate of the young Di Francia was eventually not limited to written words.
               One day, as he was coming out of the Cathedral wearing his best suit and his top hat, in the
               corner of the square he noticed a charlatan, who, after gathering a crowd, was ranting about the
               Pope. Without any hesitation, the young Marquis Di Francia broke into the crowd, faced the
               impostor, and silenced him immediately with a loud slap, which all applauded.

                                      THE JOURNEY TO PRIESTHOOD





               1. Hannibal’s Vocation

                       Upon returning from the Boarding House to his family, the young Hannibal felt in his
               heart a strong impulse to devotion and union with God. At seventeen, his confessor permitted
               him to receive Holy Communion every day, which, at that time, was truly a privilege. This
               leads us to suppose a real progress in this young man’s spiritual life. However, he did not yet
               feel any clue of being called to ecclesiastical life. For some time, he even thought of being
               destined to raise his own family. At eighteen, with the tingling of the growing personality, he
               felt a greater need for reflection and concentration, to put himself into an attitude of listening
               to the voice of God and to let it set the rhythm of his heartbeat.
                       In September 1869, in the ode “Solitude”, Hannibal wrote:

                       When the heavenly and angelic poetry
                       Will ignite my soul with a great desire of love,
                       Clinging to the holy images of Christ and Mary
                       I will never cease to cry,
                       l will never cease to love.

                       Finally, the Lord heard Hannibal’s plea. One day, he said confidentially to me, “My
               vocation had three characteristics: 1) First of all, it was sudden. Although I liked a pious life,
               in those days when masonry and liberalism were dominant, I was not thinking of becoming a
               priest. Unexpectedly the Lord sent me His light. 2) It was irresistible. I felt that I could not
               escape from the power of grace. I had absolutely to surrender. 3) It was very certain. After that
               light, I was absolutely sure that God was calling me. I could not entertain the least doubt that
               the Lord wanted me to follow that way.”
                       Was  it  then  that  Hannibal  thought  of  becoming  a  Jesuit?  Maybe.  In  fact,  in  ‘The
               Catholic Word’ of October 3, 1869, he published a [book] review of the life of John Berchmans
               who had been declared a ‘Blessed’ by Pius IX in 1865. He was pleased because that book “can
               do much to the hearts of young people, and it may give them a holy fondness for the religious
               institutions where these very pure lilies of the Lord sprout. It may create attraction especially
               for the Order of the glorious St. Ignatius, which, though opposed by ungodly people, never
               ceases to stand out among all for its doctrine and sanctity.”
                       Either  then  or  sometime  later,  Hannibal  felt  a  desire  to  enter  the  Jesuits,  but  his
               confessor did not approve and steered him toward the diocesan priesthood.





                                                           21]]></page><page Index="22"><![CDATA[2. How I Wish There Were Still Saints

                       On the morning of December 8, 1869, the day of the opening of the Vatican Council I
               in Rome, after a night spent in prayer, Hannibal wore his cassock together with his brother
               Francesco. They put them on in the Church of the Immaculate, at the feet of the Most Holy
               Virgin, defying the opposition of their relatives, particularly of their mother who did not let
               them into the house until her confessor ordered her to do so.
                       In his self-eulogy he wrote for his funeral, speaking in the third person, Hannibal hinted
               about his vocation, “At seventeen, he felt called to the priesthood in a rather exceptional or
               not exactly ordinary way.” He expresses his motives, “He was compelled by some love for
               devotion, with the purpose of belonging entirely to Jesus and bring souls to Him.”

                       In 1922, in a talk delivered in Naples, speaking of his visit to Sister Maria Luisa di
               Gesú, Father Hannibal gives us a hint of what is in his mind. “In the blossoming stage of my
               life, when I was not yet a priest but already clothed with the cassock, at times I enjoyed intensely
               - and still enjoy - reading the lives of the saints. Still unaccustomed to religious experiences, I
               imagined that holy men and women belonged to past times, and then they ended, like some
               heroes of the legends who are not reproduced anymore. I used to say to myself, ‘How I wish
               that there were still saints! How I would like to know and love them and obtain any grace from
               God through them!’
                       “With  a  spirit  vibrating  with  youthful  ardor,  I  objectively  represented  sanctity  as
               existing only in the unfathomable regions of the most transcendental mysticism. I thought of it
               as that intimate communication of a chosen person who no longer lives the life of the senses
               but has transformed himself entirely in God and has drawn the divine splendors into himself,
               as  a  very  clear  mirror  placed  in  front  of  the  sun’s  rays.  A  Saint  is  a  person  who  lives  a
               supernatural life, not common to all other men, and as a trustee of the divine Goodness, can
               draw endless graces and blessings upon the earth.
                       “In truth, such were the great heroic men and women of Christianity whom the Holy
               Church elevates to the honor of the altar.
                       “With this worry, I went to Fr. Pietro da Porto Salvo, a venerable Franciscan Father,
               in a convent in Messina, and I presented to him my doubt: that if there were still superhuman
               beings on earth as in the past centuries. Fr. Pietro was a man of God and told me that souls of
               perfect holiness are never lacking on earth; and that our Lord Jesus never leaves His Mystical
               Bride, the Church, deprived of them.”
                       Thus, Hannibal learned from him about Sister M. Luisa di Gesú who was famous in
               Naples and its surroundings for her great sanctity. Immediately, he thought of going to Naples:
               “I  arrived  there  on  July  26,  1870.  I  throbbed  with  holy  emotion  before  the  gates  of  the
               Monastery of Stella Mattutina, in the presence of the humble Servant of the Lord, who, gifted
               as she was with the Lord’s Spirit, foreshadowed my future with what her Heavenly Bride
               inspired her.”


               3. The Ministry of the Word

                       As Hannibal entered the clerical state, a thirst for souls blazed in his young seminarian’s
               heart, and he used his spare time, after his studies, for apostolic works. He dedicated himself
               preferentially  to  teaching  catechism  to  the  children  and  to  preaching.  He  already  showed
               special skills for this, refined by the practice of declamation in the Boarding House.





                                                           22]]></page><page Index="23"><![CDATA[His years as a cleric were remarkable especially for an intensive preaching activity in
               Messina and its surroundings. It would be rare today to see a seminarian preaching with the
               intensity of the young Di Francia but times then led to this. We would like to mention the
               Saturday sermons he preached for several years about Our Lady; the homilies for the whole
               month of May of 1876 in the Parish Church of San Lorenzo, when he introduced the devotion
               to our Lady of Lourdes in Messina; and in the following July, the novena of the Most Precious
               Blood in the Church of St. Luke.

                       He even received an invitation, with the approval of the respective Bishops, to preach
               a novena for St. Veronica Giuliani in Città di Castello (Perugia), but he had to decline because
               of health problems.


               4. Collaboration with The Catholic Word

                       In the meantime, Hannibal continued his collaboration with the weekly newspaper The
               Catholic Word.
                       He composed ‘The Church and the 1870 Ecumenical Council’, a poem in metered
               verses without rhyme, which continued through several issues of the newspaper retracing the
               history of the Councils and singing the glories of the Church.
                                                                      th
                       ‘Pains and Triumphs’, a solemn poem for the 25  anniversary of the crowning of Pius
               IX, was published in June 1871. ‘August 23, 1871’ marks the day in which Pius IX celebrates
               the pontificate of St. Peter. Since Hannibal was in Rome on September 20, 1871, he wrote the
               ‘Reminiscences of the City of Rome’.
                       Of course, in all these verses, the author cannot but deplore the violence done to the
                                                               4
               Church and the Pope with the breach of Porta Pia.

                  4
                    Publishing again these verses in the book Faith and Poetry, fifty years later, Father Hannibal added this note,
               “These verses were written by the author immediately after the entry of the Italian army in Rome when the spirit
               of all the Catholics and true lovers of the Supreme Pontiff felt wounded in their attachment to the Vicar of Jesus
               Christ. Nobody knew what would have happened to the Pope. [TN: Rome was part of the Pope’s State that
               comprised the central portion of Italy. The entry of the Italian army in Rome after a symbolic battle and the breach
               at Porta Pia marked the end of the Papal State and therefore also of the temporal power of Pope. Pius IX, who was
               the Pope then, was confined into what is today known as the Vatican State]. Later on, the events demonstrated
               how  the  Almighty,  who  turns  everything  to  his  glory,  has  granted  success  to  his  divine  perspective  with  the
               exaltation of the Roman Pontifical Sovereignty. In fact, in the many years that Rome has been aggregated to Italy,
               even the enemies of the Holy See were forced to admire closely what the glory of the Papacy means and the
               unshakable stability of this divine Institution. They had to recognize that the gates of Hell, that is, all the adverse
               infernal or human powers, would not prevail against the Church and will never prevail, according to the infallible
               promise of Our Lord Jesus Christ: ‘They shall not prevail!’, as it has been confirmed by twenty centuries of
               history. In the swirling of the passions, clashing of political parties, and agitation of peoples, the divine figure of
               the Vicar of Jesus Christ, in more than fifty years since the taking over of Rome [by the Italian army], has remained
               noble, sublime, peacekeeping, admonishing, generous, and holy, a true image of the redeeming Christ and of
               God! The Italian conscience has remained enchanted at the feet of the unshakable Rock of the Vatican, by the
               triumphs of a helpless Venerable Old Man [the Pope] whom the world admires stupefied! In this way, those who
               knew the Papacy only through the mockery and the misleading news of the bad press were disenchanted and they
               even wound up admiring and loving what they saw and touched with their hands.” In 1921, when Father Hannibal
               wrote this footnote, the “Conciliation” (Conciliazione) was still far and the Roman Question remained actual and
               sensitive [TN: Rome was the capital of Italy led by an anticlerical and masonic government and at the same time,
               it was See of the Pope, head of the Catholic Church restricted to the Vatican State]. “For what concerns the Roman
               Question which is still alive, though wishing that our noble, great, and powerful homeland, Italy, be privileged
               by God among all the nations, this author entrusts himself without any restriction to follow the mind of the Vicar
               of Christ and his successors”.

               For the death of Vittorio Emmanuele II, King of Italy, that newspaper had collected a fictional
               correspondence from Rome, true or false, according to which Pius IX would have been very
               sorry for the way he had dealt with the King. “The Pope became horrible in appearance, and
               screaming at the Cardinals who surrounded him, threatening them and shouting, ‘Woe to you,
               if with your venomous mouth you contaminate the sacred and pure figure of this great saint of
               Savoy (the King’s household)!”

                       The  young  Hannibal  answered  to  the  point,  but  we  limit  ourselves  to  report  the
               conclusion of his long article: it is a temperate admonition to the writers of the newspaper:
               “Believe me! In the extreme moments of life, you will not be comforted by the articles written
               against the Church, by the homage given to the enemies of Jesus Christ, or by the insults
               launched against the Pope and the Priests. Rather, you will find comfort in the memory of
               having been firm in the true faith in which you were born, of having constantly served Jesus
               Christ, of having sacrificed pride, won over passions, and defended the truth as well as the joy
               of dying in the womb of the Catholic Church. May God allow each of you to take advantage of
               these great truths!” (The Catholic Word, January 23, 1878).
                       As we can see, the fury of the son of thunder was cooling down!



               5. “Pray the Master of the Harvest”

                       In the same newspaper on March 13, 1875, there is an unsigned “Invitation to Pray”,
               which I believe had been written by the young Hannibal. If so, that would be the first time that
               he mentions the Divine Command - the Rogate - in the press.
                       After Mons. Luigi Natoli’s death, Messina was waiting for a new Archbishop. The
               Catholic Word invited the citizenry to pray, and I cannot think of anyone else but Hannibal as
               the author of that article.
                       “We could not raise a more welcome supplication to God than this because He himself
               told us, ‘Look at these fields covered with ripe crops. Pray, therefore, the Master of the harvest
               that He may send laborers to harvest it.’ If we are accustomed to hasten with public prayers in
               asking God to send the rain on our fields, how much more shall we pray to God, with fervor,
               to bless the vineyards of our souls through the pastoral care of a wise Shepherd, full of divine
               wisdom? With all our hearts, let us ask the Virgin of the Sacred Letter, our patroness, to send
               a holy and learned Archbishop, a wise, prudent and strong man, and devoted to her. Let us
               pray! The humble, confident, and persevering prayer is all-powerful with the infinitely merciful
               Heart of God! The more we pray to Him, the more we will see the abundant fruits of our
               prayers.” Hannibal then mentioned the great Bishops of the Church’s history: St. Ignatius, St.
               Basil, St. Charles Borromeo, St. Francis of Sales, and St. Alphonsus Liguori…



               6. Priest!

                       While he was still a cleric, on January 26, 1876, Hannibal obtained the Diploma of an
               elementary school teacher, also in order to give some help to his mother and not to be a burden
               to his family.
                       What about his studies for the priesthood? At that time, the Seminary of Messina was
               closed because of the political upheavals. Seminarians attended classes with some professors
               like  Prof.  Catara  Lettieri  for  Philosophy,  Canon  Ardoino  for  Morals,  Canon  Filocamo  for


                                                           24]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[Dogma, and Mons. Basile for Canon Law. This was the condition of most of the seminaries in
               Italy. However, this was to the detriment of the soundness and integrity of the theological
               studies. Hannibal used this as an opportunity to humble himself. In fact, he writes in his self-
               eulogy, “He was very weak in theological studies, and judging with strict criteria of justice, he
               could not have been ordained as a priest.”
                       Certainly, he was not a man born to sit behind a desk. God destined him to action, but
               regarding his theological studies, he was well versed, as his writings show.
                       On March 16, 1878, Saturday of the Spring Ember in the Lenten Season, the new
               Archbishop of Messina, Mons. Giuseppe Guarino ordained him as a priest in the Church of the
                           5
               Holy Spirit.  Note that from the time that he was a cleric, Hannibal had already begun the
               Saturday weekly preaching in the Parish Church of San Lorenzo. Even on the day of his priestly
               ordination, he wanted to be faithful to that commitment and spent the afternoon in his small
               room to prepare the sermon for the evening. He dedicated it to St. Joseph, whose feast was the
               following Tuesday, as he wanted to express his gratitude to the great Saint for having reached
               the priesthood.
















































                  5
                    Hannibal received the minor orders of Tonsure, Porter, and Lectorate on September 15, 1872, from Mons.
               Natòli in the Chapel of the Archiepiscopal Palace; and the Exorcist and Acolytate on March 20, 1873, in the
               Cathedral.  He  was  ordained  to  the  Subdiaconate  by  Mons.  Guarino  on  June  10,  1876,  in  the  Church  of  the
               Monastery of St. Teresa and to the Diaconate on May 26, 1877, in the Church of Montevergine.

                                         IN THE AVIGNONE DISTRICT





               1. The Gardenias of Cumia

                       One day, a florist named Lorenzo was entering Messina with a basket of gardenias, the
               snow-white, fragrant gardenias from Cumia, a village on the outskirts of Messina. All of a
               sudden, the basket slipped from his hands and the snow-white flowers fell into a muddy pool.
                       The poor man seeing the loss of his earnings for that day exclaimed, “May God’s will
               be done!”
                       “Yes, well said, my blessed son. May the adorable will of God be always done!” added
               immediately Father Di Francia who was a few steps behind the poor man, as he saw the scene
               and heard the words. Then he continued, “It is just a small matter. Keep still, hold the basket.”
               The priest bent down, collected one by one the flowers that had fallen into the mud, and placed
               them back in the basket. They were snow-white and intact like before! “Miracle!” shouted the
               astounded poor man. However, Father Di Francia had already hastened on his way.
                       God raised Father Di Francia for this mission, to lift souls from the mud of the streets
                                                                        *
               and make their beauty shine in the light of truth and grace.


               2. Encounter with Zancone


                       Hannibal was still a Deacon when our Lord arranged an encounter that was going to be
               decisive for his future.
                       One day, he chanced upon a young blind man whose name was Francesco Zancone. He
               was begging for alms.
                       “Where do you live?” the Deacon inquired.
                       “At the Avignone Houses.”
                       “Where are the Avignone Houses?”

                       “Near the Zaera creek.”
                       “Do you know anything about God?”
                       “Who is going to teach me?”
                       “I will come to visit you. Take this.”  Hannibal left some coins in his hand.


               3. A Cursed Land

                                          *
                       During the carnival  of 1878, Hannibal was able to find the Avignone Houses. They
               were named after their owner. It was a neighborhood on the outskirts of Messina consisting of

               dirt.  Consequently,  it  was  a  place  of  great  confusion,  ignorance,  and  the  most  degrading
               material and moral disorder. That place had been defined as “a portion of a cursed land,
               inhabited by a herd of beasts.”
                       Hannibal immediately realized that “there could be no better place to exercise some
               charity out of love for our Lord Jesus Christ who loves the poor so much and wants them to be
               saved.”
                       In front of the slender figure of the young priest who came with the claim of a reformer,
               the “somebodies” of that ghetto felt the duty to take a stand and ordered him openly to leave.
               “To convert this kind of people, we need two Capuchins with a beard this long,” they said,
               accompanying the words with an eloquent gesture. “It is not a job for you. You must leave.”
                       Hannibal did not leave. Instead, he plunged into that mud up to his neck. One of the
               toughest struggles he had to suffer was against… insects. Bugs swarmed on the rotting garbage
               and horribly infested that crowd of poor people “to the point that some of them died, - Father
               Hannibal wrote - slowly devoured by those insects.”
                       Despite  all  the  hygienic  steps  taken,  the  bugs  could  not  be  exterminated.  Father
               Hannibal got rid of them through faith, to which he would always resort. He made a fervent
               novena to St. Joseph Benedict Labre who used to keep those small insects on himself as a
               penance. The Saint intervened, since Father Hannibal did not have the same strange vocation
               of the great French Pilgrim.

                       Father Hannibal’s work began slowly to bear fruit. At the cost of countless sacrifices,
               the Avignone slums changed its face and were redeemed both morally and materially. “The
               Father”, as Father Di Francia began to be called, made that ill-famed place the center of his
               works of charity and zeal that was to spread widely in Italy and abroad, especially to the
               advantage of the abandoned orphans.



               4. Beginning the Work

                       Let us go back to the beginning and try to follow Father Hannibal in his first apostolic
               experiences among those people. He started to work in that hellish bedlam of Avignone, a huge
               task that showed clearly the virtue of the young priest. That herd of brutes had to be raised first
               to the level of being human, and then to the dignity of being Christians. He was well aware that
               he had to start with the body to reach the soul, treasuring the advice of Venerable Ludovico da
               Casoria, “Once you find a poor man and had him cleaned and clothed from head to toe, and
               after you have helped him for at least a month, then you can start talking to him about the
               Confession.”
                       So Hannibal started to clean, provide clothes, beds, food, and money. He began to buy
               those hovels, unfortunately at the price of gold, to have a home-base and a meeting place.
                       However, it was impossible to continue working alone. Some priests joined him, first
               of all, Canon Ciccolo who was particularly endowed with organizational abilities but only to
               call the attention of the city officials about the miserable conditions of that neighborhood, and
               to solicit contributions. On March 19, 1881, the matrons of Messina’s aristocracy prepared and
               served a meal for all those poor. That same morning, for the first time, a Mass was celebrated
               in one of the shanties, transformed into a chapel. The following year, March 19, 1882, a meal
               was prepared again for all the children of the neighborhood. In October of the same year, Fr.
               Angelo Colantoni, of the Franciscans, offered another meal to celebrate the centennial of St.




                                                           27]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[Francis. The meal was honored by the presence of Archbishop Giuseppe Guarino who blessed
               the dinner served by the young men of the Catholic Club.
                       In reality, the aid given to Father Hannibal by his occasional helpers was limited to the
               organization of those free meals and a modest charitable bazaar. Therefore, he remained alone
               to battle the infinitely moral and material miseries, with the scarcely enviable inheritance of
               the high-sounding name of ‘Marquis of Avignone!’
                       Of course, he could not demand heroism from everybody. When Canon Ciccolo set foot
               in Avignone for the first time, he came out pale and terrified and, even though he helped, he
               felt that he could not commit himself as Father Hannibal did.


               5. Relations with Fr. Cusmano

                       The direct testimonies about the beginning of the Work and the grim life of its initial
               years have faded away because of time. However, a bundle of letters that Father Hannibal wrote
                                               6
               to  [Blessed]  Giacomo  Cusmano   gives  us  shining  evidence  and  an  image  of  the  working
               environment and the inhuman conditions where Father Hannibal laid the foundation of his
               Institutions.
                       In August 1884, Father Hannibal wrote to Fr. Cusmano, “My God, what a horror! To
               poverty,  we  must  add  the  demoralization  and  the  frightful  destruction  of  innocence  and
               virginity! I am alone, completely alone, trusting the Providence and with no means, since I am
               poor myself, I worked to raise those poor people, to improve those dirty places, and to save the
               endangered innocence and virginity.”
                       In another letter of that same month, Hannibal insistently recommended Fr. Cusmano,
               “Above all, pray the Highest God, His holy Mother, and St. Joseph to grant those holy virtues
               may blossom in Avignone which so far has been a place of horror and abandonment!”


               6. The First Orphanages

                       Without forgetting the adults, whom he provided material bread, besides moral and
               religious instructions, Father Hannibal dedicated himself particularly to the care of the little
               ones. He began with the evening school for the small boys and a shelter for girls from five to
               eight years old who returned to their homes at night. Then, on September 8, 1882, he started
               the  orphanage  for  girls,  which  he  named  “Small  Shelter  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus”,  and  later
               “Shelter  of  Mary  Immaculate”.  The  following  year,  on  November  4,  1883,  he  began  the
               orphanage for boys.

                       The boys were initiated to the arts and trades. With an old printing machine donated by
               Mr. Crupi, they set up a printing shop. Besides, a shoemaking shop was started, and, as Father
               Di Francia wrote, “We hoped to start soon other useful trades.”
                       The girls were taught female works. A group of elderly and crippled women was added
               to them. In all, there were about a hundred of them.



                  6  Fr. Cusmano (1834-1888) was the founder of the Institute ‘Boccone del Povero’ (The Morsel for the Poor)

                       From the above-mentioned correspondence with Fr. Cusmano, we get other information
               to complete the picture of the Institution in those years. “With God’s help, I was able to build
               a small chapel dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus... On its facade is written, “Rogate
               Dominum Messis” (Lk 10:2). I am striving to make this spirit of prayer for this greatest interest
               of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, that is, the grace to have good laborers for the holy Church,
               become the spirit and the life of this Work.” He looked tenderly on those boys who showed
               some seeds of priestly vocation: “I cherish the idea of fostering holy vocations to the priesthood
               if ever I can see them, as I hope in Jesus.” “The girls are working. Some of them want to
               dedicate themselves to Jesus, and they look like the first little flowers blossoming among the
               horrors of this place!”
                       The correspondence between the two priests had started and continued with the purpose
               of realizing an eventual entrustment of Father Hannibal’s Institution to the “Bocconiste” Sisters
               founded by Fr. Cusmano. Father Di Francia explained, “This place of the poor, where your
               pious daughters shall come, is a vineyard chosen by the Divine Farmer. However, still many
               thorns and suffering surround it! Dear Father, I do not conceal from you that upon coming
               here your daughters will find many occasions to practice all the virtues: patience, humility,
               holy poverty, charity, mortification, and others. They will find the cross of Jesus Christ spread
               all  over  the  place.  Nonetheless,  the  Work  is  great,  and  great  are  the  plans  of  the  Divine
               Providence on it. This place has been the scorn and the shame of the entire city of Messina.
               The extreme poverty and deprivation have gone hand in hand for the almost forty years that
               this place has existed. It seems that God wants to transform it into a place of grace, glory, and
               mercy, and a dwelling of sanctified poverty. Such transformation has already started but is still
               in its beginnings.”
                       Speaking of the girls, he noticed, “Here, the spirit of Christian perfection begins to
               blossom. This is the community where the Bocconiste Sisters should come to live, and I assure
               you, my dear Father, that they will find a beautiful vineyard to cultivate but not without thorns.”
               Then he concluded, “I am asking the Sacred Heart of Jesus that, in making this important
               foundation in Messina, He may enlighten you to choose among the best of your daughters.
               Long live Jesus, our Love!”



               8. A Work that is One of a Kind

                          Father Di Francia was afraid he had not given a sufficiently clear picture of his
               Institution and did not want to disappoint Fr. Cusmano. “I see that you have formed a very high
               opinion of this foundation. In this pious Institution, there is no such discipline, development of
               arts and skills, or the works that you may imagine. On the contrary, all is just starting. The
               Institution is still a draft, and you cannot figure it out if you do not see it. It is special, it was
               born from chaos, and it is growing beyond any calculation, amidst strange new sufferings and
               miseries!” He concluded with a solemn profession of humility, “There is only one thing that
               this work needs to become sublime: it needs a man of God as its leader!”
                       What  about  the  resources  for  its  livelihood?  Father  Hannibal  wrote,  “We  have  no
               income,  and  we  live  merely  on  alms.  It  seems  humanly  impossible  to  survive.  We  live  in
               hardship  from  day  to  day,  but  we  see  the  great  miracles  of  the  Divine  Providence!
               Contradictions, difficulties, and worries are always present. Long live Jesus!”




                                                           29]]></page><page Index="30"><![CDATA[In another letter, he repeated, “The Institution has no income of any kind and is living
               merely on alms. The Divine Providence wonderfully manifests itself, although we are always
               full of debts.”

                       He urged Fr. Cusmano to visit the Work also for his personal appraisal, “My dearest
               Father, never mind thinking about starting or not this foundation in Messina. This can be set
               later after you visit Messina. In the meantime, what is important is that you come. After you
               see the situation, I am sure that you will send your Sisters. In any case, your coming here will
               not just be of little benefit but will be of great help, as I find myself almost drowning in worries.
               I have almost reached the edge of exhaustion. I turn to the right or to the left and find no one
               to console me. Dear Father! I feel the need to find, even for just a moment, a person who can
               understand the Institution and me; a person who can guide and teach me. You might say that
               you are not up to that. All right! The true consoler is God. Jesus is the true teacher, but you,
               Father, have been involved in these works for several years, while I, only for a few. Therefore,
               you can enlighten me with the assistance of our Lord. I have so many things to tell you!” He
               added, “I am waiting eagerly for your arrival as the herald of new blessings from the Holy
               Heart of Jesus to this place where He planted His cross amidst the most extreme moral and
               material poverty and sowed the mysterious mustard seed!”
                       We  will  see  later  how  this  mysterious  mustard  seed  developed  into  a  tree  with  its
               branches giving shelter to the birds of the sky.


               9. He Saw and Kissed Jesus

                       In the very early days of his apostolate, Father Hannibal met a dumb, filthy boy who
               was drooling. He was the laughing stock of the little rascals who were teasing him and making
               a fool of him. The Father took him away from that mayhem, brought him home, washed him,
               cleaned him up, and laid him on his bed to rest. Remembering that the poor represent our Lord,
               he bent down and kissed the boy. He had a mental vision, for a moment: he saw and kissed
               Jesus Christ!
                       Perhaps in Father Hannibal’s tender verses in honor of the Holy Face of our Lord there
               is a hint at that beautiful vision. The vision disappeared immediately, but it left an everlasting
               blessing on the spirit of lively faith and burning charity for the poor that characterized his entire
               life. The poor became for him the truly great ones in the kingdom of God. Even when he called
               them marquises, barons, princes, as he used to, it was not a joke or irony, as one might think
               but a manifestation of his inner-most conviction. I remember a beautiful expression of Canon
               Celona, “For Father Hannibal, the poor were truly Jesus Christ.” Therefore, cleaning them,
               kneeling in front of them, washing their feet, kissing them with affection was one of the most
               intense and purest joys of his spirit, and he did this very often.


               10. Defender of the Poor

                       The cause of the poor was the Father’s cause and we recall a defense he wrote in 1899,
               when the municipality of Messina became cruel to the mendicants, organizing a true “hunt of
               beggars”.  Thus, with the justification of the law, the beggars were arrested to the point that a
               judge boasted of having imprisoned more than sixty of them. Father Hannibal wrote a strong
               protest asking all the newspapers of the city to publish it. First, he defined the right concept of
               the  law  against  mendicancy:  “The  law  condemns  begging  when  done  forcefully  by  young



                                                           30]]></page><page Index="31"><![CDATA[beggars who prefer to bother and maybe cheat people instead of working.” This was not the
               case. “It is an entirely different matter when you have a poor old man who is asking for a bit
               of bread so as not to die of hunger like a dog! In this case, where are the forceful manners?
               Which law applies to this derelict? Is poverty a crime? I know that poverty is considered a
               disgrace, bad luck, an unhappy situation, a grave tribulation, but this does not mean that to be
               poor is to be a criminal. If poverty were a crime, if poor men were criminals, why then did the
               Lord Jesus Chris  who came into the world to teach us to love each other as brothers, embrace
               poverty, protect the poor, and said that whatever we do to an abandoned poor we do it to Him?
               The poor man is deprived of many things, but at least let him enjoy the free sun, the fresh air,
               the wide horizon of nature, in our days when there is so much freedom for everybody! The more
               we consider this social injustice, the more frightful it appears!”
                       The city’s newspapers published the protest, and the “hunt of beggars” toned down, at
               least for some time.

                                                    DIFFICULTIES






               1.  It Is God Who Sows, Not Man

                       Let us look at the countless difficulties that Father Hannibal had to face, and which are
               unavoidable in any good endeavor. They are signs of the heavenly blessing that wants such
               works to be accompanied and sustained by the Cross.
                       We present the words of Father Di Francia himself on the overview of the struggles that
               he had to face in establishing his Institution. He used general terms, but they reflect perfectly
               his conditions.

                       “Who  doesn’t  know  how  burdensome  and,  at  times,  humanly  unbearable  are  the
               difficulties surrounding the development of our Lord’s works? I would say that He who starts
               such works must fight against four opposing elements:
                       First,  he  has  to  fight  against  external  oppositions:  criticism,  persecution,  and
               disapproval even from good people... Add to that the scarcity of means, poverty, defections, the
               ingratitude even of the persons who receive the benefits, and a hundred more difficulties and
               painful vicissitudes.
                       Second, he must fight against himself. Man becomes weak, feels like fainting... yet he
               needs strength, sacrifice, and perseverance. It is a state of continuous violence to one’s self.
                       Third, there is one who, day and night fights extrinsically and intrinsically, through
               men and through our own passions: Satan!
                       However, he who starts such works finds himself in a fight of a very different kind, and
               this is the fourth one. It is the fight of Jacob against the Angel. He has to fight with God Himself.
               The  Almighty  God  is  the  author  of  any  good  work,  and  man  is  only  a  frail  and  useless
               instrument. Yet, it is in and with this instrument that God works! He wants self-sacrifice. Jesus,
               the Highest Good, wants us to imitate him... God wants the works, but He wants them formed
               amidst hardship, wailing sighs, and sacrifices. He works with two hands: with one, He supports
               the frail instrument, and with the other, He trains it to fight. Then man comes to know his
               powerlessness and nothingness. He comes to distrust, humble, and annihilate himself, and to
               consider himself as the obstacle to any good result... Finally, the fight of Jacob with the Angel
               ends with a strong embrace accompanied by that loving statement, ‘I will not leave you until
               you grant me your blessings,’ and concludes with the abundance of the divine blessings, which
               will be all the more abundant, the longer and more arduous the mysterious fight has been.
               Thus, it was God who sowed, not man.”


               2. Mother ... Grant Me Good Counsel

                          “These four kinds of difficulties,” continues Father Hannibal, “surrounded this small
               Work of charity and buffeted it from every side from its first beginnings. Difficult situations


                                                           32]]></page><page Index="33"><![CDATA[kept  increasing  with  an  intertwining  of  circumstances  that  the  Institution  found  itself  in  a
               whirlwind of tribulations, and hundreds of times, it was close to dying, even before being born.
               How often I felt impelled to say with the wailing prophet, ‘A deluge of waters fell on my head,
               and I said, I am lost’.”
                       However, his trust in God never wavered, and he was sustained by his recourse to the
               Heavenly Mother.
                       Father Hannibal wrote, “Cesare Arici, the poet from Brescia (Italy), was an elegant
               lyricist and belonged to the select group of poets at the beginning of our century. He has written
               very beautiful poems to honor the Most Holy Virgin under the noble title of Our Lady of Good
               Counsel. I remembered often these verses, and at the times when the storm raged and any way
               out seemed closed, I used to declaim those delicate verses:

                       As the pilgrim, along the way saw You
                       Clearing the clouds with the batting of an eyelash,

                       O Mother, grant me your counsel
                       To save my little boat.

                       “The  Holy  Virgin  is  the  channel  of  all  the  graces  coming  from  heaven.  Moreover,
               according to St. Bernard, all graces pass through her beautiful hands. The whole management
               of the heavenly treasury is entrusted to her. We see her at the beginnings of the human salvation
               and she is the head of all the Works and of the large and small Institutions rising in the Church
               of Jesus Christ.
                       With this confidence, I used to invoke often the Mother of Good Counsel.”


               3. Ungrateful Environment

                       Here are some details of the difficulties encountered by Father Hannibal…

                       First, the environment where he was working. He was surrounded by people of the
               lowest level, unable to understand the situation of degradation in which they were living and
               to appreciate the efforts of the pious priest wearing himself out for their redemption. Imagine,
               the women even demanded to be paid in order to leave their small daughters in the Institute!
               They could not understand that a boarding house had disciplinary regulations for visits and
               relations with outsiders. When the Father was out of town; the lady, who was the head of the
                                                           *
               Shelter, placed a kind of small revolving door  in the parlor. There was a real riot. The mothers
               stormed the Institute and took their daughters home.
                       The Father then had to start all over again. There was opposition from relatives and
               friends. Even the clergy could not understand him. Why should he lose himself amidst the
               garbage of humankind, when he could and ought to be an orator, an apologist, a teacher?








               *  TN. This is like “foundling wheels” of the medieval orphanages, where the abandoned babies could be left to be
               taken care of.

                                                           33]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[4. Authoritative Encouragement

                       Father Hannibal’s vocation was different and he was resolved to follow it, courageously
               facing  any  difficulty  with  the  blessing  of  his  Archbishop  who  had  told  him,  “Go,  go  to
               Avignone, and save those poor people!”
                        Besides  this  encouragement,  there  were  also  those  of  a  renowned  servant  of  God,
               Ludovico da Casoria and the great St. John Bosco.
                       The former expressed his opinion about the newborn Institution, “I like it. I like it since
               it is born in the stable of Bethlehem,” hinting at the poverty of the beginnings. Then, as already
               mentioned, he shared with Father Hannibal his own practical experiences in the apostolate
               among the poor suggesting to start with the body to reach the spirit.
                       Through Don Rua, Don Bosco wrote to him, “Take courage. The works of God suffer
               great difficulties, but that is precisely the clear evidence that they belong to the Lord; thus, they
               cannot  perish,  if  the  one  who  is  the  instrument  in  bringing  them  about  continues  with
               indomitable faith.” He advised Father Hannibal to use printed material, “If you could have some
               local  newspaper  talking  about  you,  many  would  come  to  know  your  situation  and  some
               charitable persons will be touched in their heart.”


               5. The Illness of His Brother

                       The illness of his brother Giovanni was a heavy burden for Father Di Francia. Hannibal
               stayed constantly at his side. According to some notes of Father Hannibal, “Giovanni won over
               the compassion of Archbishop Guarino who kept in mind that passage of St. Paul, ‘whoever
               does not provide for relatives and especially for family members, has denied the faith and is
               worse than an unbeliever’ (I Tim 5:8), and he applied it to my case. When Mrs. Jensen, in a
               letter, questioned the Archbishop on this matter, he answered, ‘Let Canon Di Francia find a
               priest to replace him in his Work.’ Since it was impossible to find a substitute, I thought that I
               was following the will of the Archbishop by leaving the Institutions almost entirely for several
               years to take care of my brother.”
                       Later on Father Hannibal rented the Alessi flat in Avignone, where he transferred the
               sick Giovanni and could also stay with his boys. However, Father Hannibal’s forced absence
               had damaging effects, “My absence was the reason one of the Institutions, the orphanage for
               the boys, turned into complete chaos.” He commented sadly, “I have seen my efforts dissipate;
               the little boys disbanded; and so many hopes of mine perished, as do the wishes of sinners! For
               all, however, blessed be the Divine Will.”
                       He  had  to  start  anew  with  the  boys’  orphanage,  Father  Hannibal  noted,  “In  the
               foundation of this pious Work, the Lord asks many sacrifices, perhaps because its destiny will
               be great!”



               6. The Struggle for Survival

                       We have to be aware of the Father’s labor and worries for many years: the struggle for
               the survival of his Institution, bombarded by thousands of oppositions but always triumphant
               by the grace of God and by the Father’s immense faith.
                       Where did Father Hannibal obtain the means to support so many people? All was the
               fruit of his industriousness and personal activities. He petitioned the municipal and provincial


                                                           34]]></page><page Index="35"><![CDATA[administrations. He also sent requests outside Messina, soliciting assistance for his Work from
               the good hearts of noble and rich people.
                       Following the advice of Don Bosco, he got the interest of the city’s newspapers, which
               more than once commended his Institutions.
                        A newspaper, La Gazzetta di Messina, on April 17, 1875, reported, “Indeed, one must
               be courageous to take over the burden of keeping and educating one hundred children when
               one has nothing to rely on. However, the help of courageous hearts will not fail to support the
               efforts of the pious priest.”
                       In the Avignone slums, people survived, yes, but always, we would say, holding their
               soul with their teeth. The Providence of the Lord was not missing in the critical moments when
               human  means  had  already  failed.  But  first,  the  Lord  wanted  Father  Hannibal  to  use  his
               resources of faith and sacrifice, to obtain large merit, so that his Work could be marked with
               the seal of God.


               7. Oh My Children, a Day Will Come…

                       After  trading  all  his  properties,  Father  Hannibal  became  a  beggar  for  his  children,
               asking charitable help from all, out of love for Jesus and Mary.
                       For more than twenty years, the city of Messina saw the heir of the Marquises of St.
               Caterina walking with long strides along the streets, under the sun, the wind and the rain, with
               faded cassock, broken shoes, and rumpled hat, knocking at every door, imploring, “Not for me
                                    7
               but for my children.”

                            So that food might not lack on their table,
                            Many times, I went frozen, ...I perspired…
                            Here, my children, is the food today,
                            God who loves you will provide tomorrow.




                  7
                    Icilio Felici (Op. cit. p. 61) also places Fr. Francesco Di Francia in Avignone at the side of Father Hannibal
               and sees “the two brothers with aristocratic blood in their veins, moving and toiling in that hellish pit that was
               then the Avignone neighborhood!” Felici thinks as “quite logical that Francesco should place himself at Father
               Hannibal's disposition to collaborate in the work he had undertaken.”
                  The reality is not exactly that. Francesco had chosen another life. He was a missionary in the diocese and
               worked at that for many years and very fruitfully, while giving to Hannibal occasional help when he could, and
               then withdrawing, like the other priests, Ciccòlo and Muscolino. I can document this assertion. In 1884, the Father
               had to stay in Rome for a while, and on July 1, he wrote to Francesco, “I recommend you those poor children of
               the Avignone Houses. Sometimes, when you can, go there to comfort them..”.
                  Fr. Francesco started to frequent Avignone in 1887. On November 25, 1887, Father Hannibal wrote to Mons.
               Guarino, “My brother, the priest, for some months, has shown a special love for these places. He often stays there,
               sleeps there from time to time, and is asking me to set up a small room for him.” Francesco joined the Father in
               1888. The Father, having to assist his brother, Giovanni, on September 9, 1888, wrote to the Sisters, “As soon as
               the Lord turned me away [from Avignone], he brought in my brother who had never thought of this work” (the
               italics is ours).
                  However, at the time of Fr. Francesco, thanks to Father Hannibal, the Avignone neighborhood had ceased to
               be a ‘hellish pit’. Even when Fr. Francesco started to reside in Avignone, his actual presence was always limited,
               because it was subordinate to the limited availability left him by his missionary commitments. Thus, the real
               beggar of Avignone was always and only Father Hannibal.

                            For you, I begged from God and men!


               8. Charity Walks

                       In August 1906, in a talk to the ladies of Messina’s aristocracy against the criticism
               continuously harassing him, Father Hannibal felt the need to request their generosity for his
               works. “I recommend to you my little orphan boys and girls! No. I am not begging you for
               alms. I ask you for other favors, for your moral support, your benevolence, your compassionate
               consideration  for  these  Institutes...  I  am  requesting  you  not  to  accept  so  easily  the  unjust
               criticism of people who, at times, moved by I do not know what spirit spread disturbing rumors,
               especially  among  the  well-to-do  classes,  to  alienate  their  minds  from  me...  and  giving  a
               negative view of my Institutes as an unnecessary work of exploitation. Dear ladies, it takes so
               little to criticize and demolish, but you are quite full of wisdom and experience to understand
               how much it takes to build up.”
                       Out of love for the truth, however, Father Hannibal acknowledged that his enemies and
               opponents in Messina were just a fraction, while almost the entire population always looked
               with fondness on his Institutes. In critical moments, he used to set up local fairs and lotteries,
               and the citizens responded generously. He loved to recall particularly the several charity walks,
               “Then all the classes of people of Messina helped: the entire city was moving! The military
               command  lent  two  large  carts  to  us,  which  we  decorated  fittingly  with  festoons  and  flags
               placing in one cart some orphan girls and in the other, several orphan boys. The military band
               went ahead of the carts, followed by the city’s band. A large crowd surrounded them and amidst
               the music and the general emotion, the two carts proceeded slowly along almost all the main
               streets of the large and beautiful city.

                       “There  was  competition  in  giving:  clothes  and  money  rained  from  the  balconies,
               textiles, and food from the stores, and different goods were offered depending on the trade of
               each merchant. Young people equipped with boxes moved around collecting. The carts had to
               return to the Institutes several times during the day to unload the clothes, food, and goods
               filling them and the collection boxes of the young people. Then they would start all over again.
               Oh, dear memories! You will never die in our hearts.”
                       An event like that would not be understood today. Social justice, with its insurance and
               welfare laws, has certainly changed the conditions of the orphans; but we are certain that it can
               never eliminate or replace charity: the sovereign law, which Christianity is spreading in the
               world, following the example and teaching of its Divine Founder.

                       Even the city administrations (except for one case, which we will report later), as well
               as the provincial ones, were always benevolent. And Father Hannibal wanted the distinguished
               benefactors  to  never  be  forgotten,  like,  for  example,  Mr.  Mariano  Gentile,  Mrs.  Luisa
               Pellegrino, the Ciampa brothers from Piana of Sorrento, the banker Grill, a Protestant but very

               Di Francia.


               9. The Work of the Boys and Girls Assisted

                       Father Di Francia depended heavily on work as a means of livelihood. For several years,
               the income provided by the printing of colored wrappers for lemons to be shipped abroad was
               very helpful. Then the works of the girls: knitwear, embroidery on white clothes, silk and gold,
               lace mesh, crochet, bobbin lace, knitted gold, ancient style lace, paper, cloth, and metal flowers,
               and  later  on  even  the  cultivation  of  flowers.  Father  Hannibal  commented,  “Indeed  if  the
               garlands of fresh flowers made by our orphan girls meant the perfume of the prayers for some
               dear departed ones, their bunches of roses and gardenias perfumed the rich tables of the
               weddings...”
                       With the inheritance left by Mr. Mariano Gentile, Father Di Francia started a mill and
               a bakery. The Father explicitly commented, “It was a very daring enterprise, which made us
               age prematurely. However, by this, we solved a serious problem of our Institution, that is, our
               daily bread, which we obtained by selling the bread made with pure wheat… Besides we are
               glad to supply the people of Messina with a perfectly pure and substantial bread, considered
               as the best for not containing any additional element.”



               10. The Predominant Thought

                       Meanwhile even amid difficulties, the work of Father Hannibal progressed. The Lord
               rewarded his faith. “For the grace of the Almighty, a thought, a feeling, a faith dominated over
               everything. Let us seek God, let us sacrifice ourselves for souls, and let us look for their success,
               sanctification, and salvation, and God will take care of everything. The practices of piety, the
               prayers, the mental prayer, the work, and some very effective and special devotions, let us call
               them “new” devout, singular, very effective and creative initiatives, were and will always be
               the great resources of this pious and beneficial Institution which was so small, poor, and abject
               at its birth.”

                                       THE APOSTLE OF THE ROGATE





               1. He Dedicated Himself to the ‘Rogate’

                       Worries of another apostolate were distressing Father Hannibal.
                       As a young man, he felt particularly inclined to the prayer to obtain priests for the
               Church, especially after reading the works of St. Alphonsus and St. Francis de Sales, which
               made him desire people like those great saints for the spread of God’s kingdom on earth. In his
                                                                                                   *
               extended adoration of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament exposed for the ‘Forty Hours’  in the
               Church of St. Giovanni of Malta, his longing had become more passionate and burning. Later,
               upon reading in the Gospel the words of Jesus: ‘Pray, therefore, the Lord ofthe harvest to send
               out laborers into his harvest’ (Rogate ergo Dominum Messis ut mittat operarios in messem
               suam; Mt. 19:38; Lk 10:2), a supernatural light enlightened his mind. He understood that the
               Lord was calling him to dedicate all his strength and life to spread this Divine Command and
               to ask everyone to obey this explicit command of the Divine Master.
                       We  have  the  specific  confession  of  Father  Hannibal  regarding  this.  Although  he
               conceals himself under the shroud of anonymity, speaking of a person who was interested in
               this Divine Command, even before reading it in the Gospel and who, with this concern, started
               his career in life. He adds, “because of his infinite goodness, the Lord, enlightened that person
               on this word of the Gospel.”
                       Then,  when  he  was  approaching  the  end  of  his  life,  in  a  serene  vision  of  the
               accomplished task, the testimony of his good conscience allowed Father Hannibal to say in his
               testament, “About the Rogate, we say nothing. He dedicated himself to it: either by zeal or by
               fixation, or both.” It was like echoing the words of Paul to Timothy: ‘I have fought a good
               fight; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith’. (2Tim 4:7). Father Di Francia too could
               say that he had fought a good battle and had come to the end of the race, that he had kept his
               faith, that is, he had been true to the mission entrusted to him by the Lord at the feet of the altar
               when he was still young.
                       Between the first and the second testimony, there is a whole life, which began from the
               Rogate, was spent for the Rogate, and ended with the Rogate. “He dedicated himself to it.”
               This is Father Hannibal in his totality!


               2. The Divine Command

                       Father Hannibal presents the command of Jesus this way, “Two evangelists, St. Matthew
               and St. Luke recorded a great word of our Lord Jesus Christ.
                       “St. Matthew expresses himself in this way (9:36-38): As [Jesus] saw the crowds, he
               felt compassion for them, because they were abandoned and scattered like a flock without its


               *
                 This is a traditional three days of adoration at the end of the Lenten Season.
                                                           38]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[shepherd. Then he said to his disciples, ‘The Harvest is really abundant, but the laborers are
               few. Therefore, pray the Master of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest’.
                       “St. Luke writes (10:2), ‘Then Jesus said to his disciples: the harvest is really abundant,
               but the laborers are few. Pray, therefore, the Master of the harvest to send out laborers into
               his harvest.’
                       “The meaning of this word is very clear. The harvest means the souls, the laborers are
               the priests and all those who have the task of saving the souls entrusted to them. The souls to
               be saved are plentiful, but the ministers of God are few. Jesus Christ said, ‘Pray, therefore, the
               Master of the harvest’ (Rogate ergo Dominum Messis...) which means: Do pray God to send
               numerous priests to his Church for the salvation of souls.

                       “In the Rogate (Pray!) there is an invitation and a command at the same time. It is
               every Christian’s duty to abide by this command. All of us must pray with this finality since
               Jesus Christ wants it.”


               3. The “Rogate” as a Great Resource for the Church

                       In the writings of Father Hannibal, we see the great thoughts which hovered insistently
               in his mind from his youthful years. “With those symbolic words, Jesus presented the Holy
               Church, the entire world, and every single social gathering as a harvest which, if well cared
               for through good laborers would fill up the mystical barns with an abundant crop. However, if
               neglected, it would miserably perish...

                       “With those words, Jesus our Lord wanted to show us that his priests are the salvation
               of this mystical harvest of souls. Without any doubt, the great secret for the salvation of the
               Church and society, the greatest resource of the Church for the expansion of the kingdom of
               God and the great means for all good in time and in eternity is contained in the obedience to
               this Divine Command. Our Lord wants us to understand that to obtain this inestimable good,
               we must ask for it from the highest Master, God. He wanted to teach us that his priests do not
               blossom by chance, that they are not formed by themselves, nor by human effort, but they come
               from the Divine Mercy, which creates, generates, and gives them to the world. Thus, if we do
               not pray to have them, we will not get them! Isn’t this one of the greatest graces that He gives?
               How can we pretend to be granted it, if we never ask for it?
                       The command of Jesus Christ is very clear: The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers
               are few. Pray, therefore!”


               4. The Supreme Infallible Remedy

                       As in the days of his earthly life, and even today, “Jesus makes his painful lament
               heard: The harvest is abundant, the laborers are few...What is the remedy? Our Lord pointed
               it out wide and universal: Pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest to send laborers into his
               harvest!”
                       “Thus,  the  supreme  and  infallible  remedy  is  tied  to  prayer.  We  call  this  remedy
               infallible because, imposed and indicated by our Lord, it cannot fail. If he suggested prayer for
               this purpose, it means that he wants it obeyed, otherwise he would not have commanded it. It
               is as if he said, if you ask for laborers for the harvest of souls, I will give them to you. This
               means also; if you do not ask for laborers, you will not have as many and as good as they are
               needed.


                                                           39]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[“Let us remember that when God wants to punish people with the worst punishment,
               he deprives them of good priests, and this is the greatest evil that can befall a nation or a city.
               On the contrary, the greatest of all the divine graces is when the Almighty God sends the good
               laborers for the care of souls, as once he sent to earth his Divine Son, of whom the priests are
               the true representatives!”


               5. The Program of His Life


                       Therefore,  the  Divine  Command  of  Jesus  was  Father  Hannibal’s  habit,  ideal,  and
               program of life.
                       He used to repeat continuously, “We offer prayers for rain, for a good harvest, and for
               deliverance from the divine punishments, while we do not care to pray the Almighty God to
               send good gospel laborers into the mystical harvest.”
                       For this purpose, Father Di Francia wrote and popularized a series of fervent prayers
               that were collected into a pamphlet and translated into various languages. He used to say, “The
               salvation of the world depends on the priests, and the means to have them is certain and
               infallible: it is the prayer demanded by our Lord Jesus Christ. If we do not obey the command
               of Jesus, it means that we do not want priests and do not want the salvation of the world.”
                       In a fervent invocation to the Sacred Heart, he implored, “Why do not all your lovers
               raise this prayer of salvation in front of you? Why, while so many souls perish, the Catholic
               world does not raise up, like a single person, to implore countless priests from your divine
               Heart? O Lord, extend this spirit of prayer from East to West, from North to South. Let the
               hearts of all the high Prelates, Bishops, and Priests of the entire Church be filled with it. Let
               the hearts of all the virgins and all the Religious Sisters consecrated to you become inflamed
               with it... We beg from you, Lord Jesus, the triumph of the Evangelical Rogation of your Heart
               in the entire Church, all over the world. Let it become a universal Rogation... That all eyes may
               turn to this divine desire of your Heart, that all ears be pierced by this unceasing cry of your
               Heart: ‘The harvest is abundant, but the laborers are few: Pray, therefore the Lord of the
               harvest!”



               6. In or Out of Season

                       We are truly dealing with a fiery person! About Father Hannibal, somebody rightly
               wrote, “The Rogate was the light of his steps, the star of his thoughts, the sun of his life. He
               was born for that; and we can just imagine Father Di Francia in the act of waving that glowing
               banner with the ardent longing to carry it to conquer the world.
                       “Indeed, in or out of season, as St. Paul puts it, Father Hannibal talked and discussed
               about the Rogate with everyone. He took advantage of any occasion and availed of every
               opportunity. His burning desire was to attract the attention of the entire Christian world on the
               necessity of this prayer. He was so consumed by the need of this prayer for the Church to have
               many good laborers, and of the effectiveness of this evangelical remedy to obtain them. To
               realize this, we can say that he moved heaven and earth.”

                       At the thought that this apostolic dream could become a reality, he once wrote to a
               Bishop, “I feel like dying of joy!”
                       On the contrary, in the eventual failure of his Institutions, nothing hurt him more than
               the thought that the Rogate could be forgotten.


                                                           40]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[“When in our enterprises,” he wrote, “everything goes upside-down, there is no other
               consolation but resignation to the Divine Will, which does everything with good reason, even
               though we do not understand it. Only those who experienced this can understand how painful
               this resignation can be in such cases. However, in my case, circumstances made this chalice
               bitter. I would have had to resign myself to let the germ of my Institution consecrated to that
               holy purpose, “Pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” get lost. I
               would have had to resign myself to fold the holy banner in which one of the most tender
               expressions of the Sacred Heart of Jesus shines, and to which the salvation of souls can be
               bound in the shortest and surest way.”


               7. All for the Rogate

                       Father Hannibal considered the charitable work where he consecrated his strength and
               those of the religious Congregations founded by him, only in view of obedience to the Rogate
               of Jesus. If we pray for good laborers, we must toil and be good laborers; and the spread of this
               spirit of prayer will be realized more efficiently by propagating it among the children who will
               bring it to the families and the society tomorrow.
                       His Congregations had as their primary purpose the obedience to the Divine Command
               and the propagation of this prayer, through a commitment to a special fourth vow. Thus, in all
               his Institutes the invocation: Lord of the harvest, send holy apostles into your Church, resounds
               abiding and fervent on all the lips of Father Hannibal’s children.


               8. The Rogate for the Clergy and the Faithful

                       For the wide spread of this spirit of prayer among the clergy, Father Hannibal founded
               the “Sacred Alliance” inviting Bishops, Prelates, and Priests to an intense crusade, in spiritual
               union with his Institutions. For the lay faithful, he canonically established the “Pious Union of
               the Evangelical Rogation of the Heart of Jesus”.
                       For his Institutes, he begged from Pope Pius X the privilege to add to the litanies of the
               Saints, a new invocation, ‘That you may deign to send abundantly worthy and holy laborers to
               your harvest, we pray You, hear us o Lord’.
                       Moreover, to extend this invocation to the Universal Church, he gathered more than
               eight hundred petitions from bishops of all the continents, which he forwarded to the Vatican
               Congregation of Rites.
                       In his correspondence with monasteries and holy persons (he was in contact with many
               of them), the thought of the Rogate comes back frequently, with the insistence of a compelling
               issue.
                       Also,  when  the  Divine  Providence  granted  him  the  means  to  build  in  Messina  a
               beautiful Temple dedicated to the Sacred Heart and the ‘Shrine of St. Anthony’, he wanted the
               words of the Divine Command to shine on its façade. You could see clearly the huge characters
               in the original Latin: Rogate ergo Dominum Messis ut mittat operarios in messem suam (Pray,
               therefore, the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest).

                       Father Hannibal insists on the word “laborers” is a term which refers first of all to priests
               but not restricted to them. It has a much wider meaning, as it embraces also all the laity whose
               activities emanate, somehow, from the priesthood and is bound to it inseparably.
                       Father  Hannibal  noted,  “The  Priesthood  exercised  under  the  authority  of  the
               Ordinaries, is the only one which has the great power of destroying the kingdom of sin, of
               planting the kingdom of Jesus Christ, and of changing the face of the earth. It has a power that
               is not of this world; it has a divine force, a miraculous secret by which it can conquer hearts
               and make all the hostile earthly and hellish powers powerless.
                       “However, the Divine Word is always a sublime synthesis which contains countless
               mysteries from which one can derive several salvific applications. That divine “Rogate ergo”
               is  not  to  be  considered  only  in  relation  to  the  priests  created  by  their  sublime  vocations,
               obtained through the obedience of that Divine Command. It must be considered also regarding
               those whom the Almighty sends with his divine grace to operate a more or less beneficial action
               in his Church and in the large harvest of souls.”
                       Father Di Francia laid down the details, “From the apostolic efforts of the priests comes
               also the formation of many collaborators, like the truly fervent Catholic laity, the Religious
               Sisters and all those who work with zeal in this holy enterprise of the eternal salvation of souls
               in the large fields of the Church and the world. Kings and Catholic rulers, enlightened by the
               Lord, as true sons of the Holy Church and the Supreme Pontiff, can and have to be the saviors
               of the mystical harvest entrusted to them, through the accomplishment of their great civil tasks.
                       “Obedience to the divine Rogate means also to ask from the Divine Goodness, teachers,
               educators, and directors of Institutions. They must be good believers, observant, and God-
               fearing so that while teaching minds with holy instructions they also educate saintly hearts.
               This prayer also serves so that the Lord may give enlightenment and graces to all parents. They
               have in their hands the large harvest of future generations. They have to edify their children
               by their example, keep them away from spiritual dangers, raise them with holy education, and
               present them as successful or well oriented to success, to that God who entrusted them with
               this purpose. Rogate ergo!”


               10. The Great Means of All Goods

                       Father Hannibal was really tireless on the topic that was at the center of his heart:
               Rogate!
                       “Concerning  society,  this  divine  word  is  the  great  means  for  all  goodness  and  for
               salvation in time and in eternity. Yet, in truth, for twenty centuries, this great word, which is
               clearly a command repeated by our Lord Jesus Christ, lay almost buried and unheeded in the
               very pages of the Gospel. Yet that divine command coming from the divine zeal of the Heart of
               Jesus contains the great secret for the salvation of Church and society. Inexplicable mysteries
               of God! Perhaps the Almighty has kept the manifestation of this secret, though so clear, until
               the present, when the Church has become deserted and the cities and peoples are deprived of
               what constitutes the greatest element of salvation.”


               11. Daybreak from on High

                       We have witnessed the gradual revelation of the secret through the Supreme Pontiffs.



                                                           42]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[Leo  XIII  encouraged  Father  Hannibal  to  go  ahead  with  his  endeavors  up  to  their
               complete realization. Pope Pius X comforted him with his blessing, observing that he had found
               a way to echo the command of Christ. Benedict XV assured Father Hannibal that the prayer for
               good laborers concerned him first of all as the Head of the Church, and proclaimed himself as
               the first Rogationist.
                       Upon approval of the “Pious Union of the Prayers for Vocations”, established in Rome
                                                                                  *
               by the Cardinal Vicar, when Pius XI defined it “the greatest work”,  Father Hannibal wrote,
               “It is indeed an inspired word. God has spoken through the mouth of his Vicar! Praying for
               holy vocations is the greatest work.  The prayer commanded by Jesus Christ to obtain priests
               for the Church, when it is constituted and organized into a work, shall be called “the greatest
               work!” If we deepen this expression, it means ‘a work dedicated to this purpose is the mother
               of many good works, generating great and holy works for the highest glory of God, the wider
               salvation of souls, and the greater realization of the divine mission of the Church of Jesus
               Christ in the entire world. It is the work that certainly obtains the chosen ones from God and
               even produces  saints in the Church.”
                       Thus, on this topic, Father Hannibal could not refrain from remarking, “With interior
               joy, we are witnessing the sparkle of the first ray of the rising sun of this spirit.” He recalled
               the expression of Pius XI, “This “daybreak from on high” started to proceed splendidly and
               brightly since the first days of the Pontificate of Pius XI.”


               12. The Full Noon

                       Death, however, did not allow Father Hannibal to witness the full noon of this bright
               sun. In his last will and testament, he wrote, “Fiat, Fiat! Amen!” Grounded in the communion
               of saints, we can presume that Father Di Francia’s prayers are not alien to the triumph of the
               Rogate, as it has developed in our times through the work of the recent Popes. His Holiness
                       *
               Paul VI  instituted the World Day of Prayer for Vocations set on the fourth Sunday of Easter,
               and he has called the attention of the faithful on two great truths. First, that the primary source
               of priestly vocation is God Himself, His merciful and free will; and second, that “The first duty
               then that devolves on all Christians about priestly vocations is that of prayer, according to the
               precept of the Lord, “The harvest indeed is abundant, but the laborers are few. Pray, therefore,
               the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into his harvest.” (Summi Dei Verbum, 21-22).
                       In the words of the Popes and their actions, the great mind of Father Hannibal thus
               could have seen the apostolic zeal, which concerned him throughout his life for the triumph of
               the divine Rogate, crowned with success!
                       In the joyful anticipation of the fruits of salvation coming from the obedience to this
               specific command of the Lord, the Father had written in his poems:



               *  EN. In the original Italian, the expression used by Fr. Tusino was “Opera delle Opere” which literally means Work
               of Works.
               *  TN. His successors, John Paul I, John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Pope Francis have not only given an increasing
               relevance to the World Day of Prayer for Vocations but with their magisterium, messages, and pastoral activities
               they have supported the development of the theology of vocation. Also, the institution of World Youth Day has
               become a powerful moment of reflection for vocations. In the second half of the twentieth century, while on the
               one hand, the Church was experiencing a worsening of the crisis of vocations, on the other, there was a blossoming
               and new attention to the pastoral care of vocations, to the formation of seminarians and religious men and women,
               and to the involvement of the laity in the building up of God’s kingdom.

                                    THE RELIGIOUS CONGREGATIONS





               1. Canon and Prefect of the Clerics

                       On January 12, 1882, the Bishop of Messina, Mons. Guarino appointed Father Hannibal
                                         *
               as Canon of the Cathedral.
                       The  Father  presented  “with  tears”  the  conditions  that  were  preventing  him  from
               accepting that honor because of his commitments with the poor of Avignone. However, the
               Archbishop insisted, encouraging him with the example of St. John Baptist de Rossi who was
               an apostle of charity even while holding the office of Canon. In that same year, the Archbishop
               also appointed Father Hannibal as the Prefect of the extern Clerics, that is, of those seminarians
               living with their families, and were assigned to some Parishes for their prayer life and to help
               the Parish Priests.



               2. One Thing Leads to Another

                       Meanwhile, the Father was taking care of his two growing Institutes. How could he
               provide for their sustenance?
                       The people of Messina admired the immense charity of Father Hannibal, and called him
               “our St. Vincent de Paul”. He could also be compared to St. Vincent for the way he behaved in
               the founding of his Institutions. St. Vincent did not bring about right away his charitable plans.
               He was afraid of disturbing the steps of the Divine Providence. Instead, he took advantage of
               the occasions he had to do good things, and then he organized and developed his works of
               charity.
                       So did Father Hannibal. He never dreamed of becoming a founder. The Providence set
               him to work in the neighborhood of Avignone, and he engaged himself with all his strength,
               always following submissively the ways of the Providence.
                       This is how he presented himself to Fr. Cusmano in August of 1884, “For more than
               six years I have been starting some Institutions; without even knowing how, I found myself in
               this situation. It seems to me that this is the will of the Almighty God who chooses weak things.”
               The Institution needed a firm direction, but he did not feel he was up to the situation and
               repeated the thought: “This Work of the Avignone Houses is really beautiful and sublime, but
               the great inconvenience is that it lacks a man of God who can lead it forward. I have been
               praying for a long time to the Sacred Heart to deign to provide this Institution with an apostolic
               man, and I said often those words of Moses in front of the burning bush: ‘I beseech thee, Lord
               send  whom  thy  wilt  send’  (Ex.  4,13,  Duoay-Rheims).  That  is  why  I  beg  you  also,  Father
               [Cusmano], to pray to the Sacred Heart of Jesus for this Institution.”

               *
                 TN. In the Roman Catholic Church, a Canon is a member of the Chapter of a Cathedral or a collegiate church,
               headed by a Dean. A Canon’s main task is to perform more solemn liturgical functions in the Cathedral and other
               tasks that the diocesan Bishop entrusts to the Chapter.

                                                           45]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[However, the man chosen by God was him, Father Hannibal, though he did not realize
               it. “One thing leads to another” he used to say; and so, from the shapeless and repugnant reality
               of the Avignone Slums, together with two orphanages, came two religious Congregations.

                       In 1901, the Father wrote to the members of the Sacred Alliance informing them that
               the names of his pious Work had been approved by the authority. “Now that I have found the
               names for these two growing Institutions, can I flatter myself that this beneficial and religious
               Institution  is  already  established?  That  it  has  already  spread  deep  roots  and  is  ready  to
               produce  abundant  fruits?  I  am  very  far  from  giving  myself  this  illusion!  The  Work  is  just
               newborn: it is still in its beginning. I can only qualify these twenty years from its start as the
               time of its slow conception. The seed has been for a long time decomposing underground.
               Yesterday, it produced its first sprout, but will this small plant grow? Will it take shape? Will
               it become a tree? God knows. If I look at the abyss of my weakness and misery, I see nothing
               good for its future, but if the Work belongs to God, His omnipotent arm will grant the persons
               suited for its formation and stability.”
                       These  persons  came,  by  divine  mercy  but  only  after  a  long  martyrdom  of  Father
               Hannibal.
                       As for the community of the orphans, for a long time, he had to take care of them by
               himself, with the help of a few pious priests and some good laypersons. There were also some
               clerics, like Antonio Damiotti and Pasquale Scibilia, although they were only occasional and
               temporary helpers. They soon disappeared because the life of Father Di Francia was made
               entirely of sacrifices and immolation, amidst the most absolute poverty bordering on misery,
               nourished only by the living flame of his faith and burning charity.



               3. The Visit of Fr. Cusmano

                       There was a time, already mentioned, when Father Hannibal thought of entrusting all
               his work, and perhaps even himself, to Fr. Giacomo Cusmano, the founder of the ‘The Morsel
               of the Poor’ (Il Boccone del Povero) in Palermo. Following his invitation, Fr. Cusmano came
               to Messina on May 11, 1885, to visit Father Hannibal’s starting work, and found it “charming
               for its poverty and for the protection in which the Lord keeps the people gathered there in an
               admirable serenity.” He was also moved by the charitable zeal of Father Di Francia and by the
               peaceful poverty enjoyed in that place. He concluded, “In my conversation with that good
               Father, it seemed that he was inclined to join us.”
                       However, this unification never happened because it was not God’s will. The two works
               had to remain separated because each had its own spirit and orientation. Fr. Cusmano wrote,
               “The merging will only destroy us.”
                       The visit of Fr. Cusmano cheered up Father Di Francia, and encouraged him to go ahead
               in his own way, according to his own method, that is, the full abandonment to the Providence.
               Father Hannibal wrote, “I asked him if in this charitable work one can acquire debts. Yes, he
               answered, because in that way we induce those who lend us money to do a work of charity. I
               asked him if in such work we must go on by accounting, that is, by computing incomes and
               expenses as it is done in the regular administration, in planning the good that can be done, or
               if we could go only by trusting in God without so many calculations.”

                         8
               miracles.”


               4. The Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus

                       However, even though he saw miracles because he did not use strict accounting, Father
               Di Francia, remained for a long time alone in Avignone. The lack of helpers was the agony of
               his whole life.
                       During the illness of his brother Giovanni, in 1888, his other brother, Fr. Francesco,
               who up to that time never thought of the Institution, started visiting the Avignone Houses. He
               settled himself there and begun helping his brother. However, this too was temporary and
               occasional, since Fr. Francesco, a very zealous priest, was dedicated to the mission of preaching
               to the people, and worked in that field for several years with great results. So, he was often
               away from the House. However, later on, this help also stopped because Fr. Francesco left to
               found a new Congregation.
                       Father Hannibal began his community in 1889 when he started gathering young people
               aspiring  to  priesthood,  forming  a  consistent  group  of  about  30  persons.  But  the  idea  of  a
               religious community was not yet clear, and the Archbishop, as soon as the young men were
               ordained, snatched them from Father Hannibal, assigning them to pastoral work in the Diocese.
               On the other hand, the young men who were attending classes in the Seminary had nothing else
               in mind except the diocesan priesthood. In fact, when in 1904, Father Hannibal proposed to
               them to start the novitiate, within a few days all of them abandoned him up to the very last one,
               leaving him alone again.
                       “Look, all of them left me!” he said one evening to Fr. Vitale, showing the empty seats
               in the refectory, but he had no complaints against any of them. He adored God’s loving will,
               overall!
                       Thus, with admirable perseverance and with the greatest confidence, he started the work
               anew. With the help of Fr. Pantaleone Palma and Fr. Francesco Vitale who later became his
               most valued collaborators, he would lay down the basis of the male Congregation, which from
               “Rogate”, he named Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus.



                  8  At the request of the Superior General of the ‘Bocconisti’, Fr. Mammana, Father Hannibal left this testimony
               on Fr. Cusmano, “I admired: 1) His great detachment, because having seen that my minimal Institutes, although
               at the beginning, had a purpose in themselves, he did not allow to aggregate them but encouraged me to continue.
               2) His great humility and love for holy poverty, because having seen that the Institutes had started in hovels and
               shanties, he exclaimed, ‘Oh, how much these little houses move me! How much I love them!’ 3) His great fervor.
               He preached during the Holy Mass with great fervor on the effectiveness of prayer, saying, among other things,
               God is omnipotent, but prayer is very omnipotent! 4) His great prayerful thoughtfulness in celebrating the Holy
               Mass. He was totally concentrated! 5) His great prudence. He told me of his meeting with Melanie, the shepherdess
               of La Salette but did not mention her name. When I asked, he replied, ‘Do not burden yourself with a secret’! 6)
               His great confidence in the Most Holy Virgin. When I asked him to reveal to me the secret by which he obtained
               graces, he answered, ‘I say a Hail Mary to the Mother of God!’ This seemed too little for my weak faith, so I went
               on questioning him three times, and he always answered: ‘I say a Hail Mary to the Mother of God!’ 7) All in all,
               the halo of sanctity that hovered on his face, and his quiet, gentle and modest speech, moved to veneration like
               that of a person dead to everything and united to God.”
                  This writing goes back to January 1912. In 1923, the ‘Bocconisti’ renewed the request for new information
               and Father Hannibal wrote a report on the visit of Fr. Cusmano to Messina and developed further the thoughts
               already expressed in 1912.

                       Initially,  Father  Hannibal  entrusted  the  girls  to  a  distinguished  lady,  Laura  Jensen
               Bucca, converted by his sermons to a life of fervor. For some years, she was a valuable help
               for him, but she retired; and the Father, after turning to various religious communities, decided
               to found a female Congregation of his own, which he named: Daughters of Divine Zeal. In his
               mind, and in this case, he was referring to the Rogate, which is the expression of the zeal of the
               Sacred Heart of Jesus burning for the glory of his Father and the salvation of souls.
                       On the eve of the Feast of St. Joseph, on March 18, 1887, Father Hannibal gave the
               habit to four girls. This was the germ of the new Congregation.
                       In one of his speeches in 1906, Father Hannibal himself revealed the intimate origin of
               the Congregation, “The very heavy task of the education of so many orphan girls placed me in
               front of a serious necessity of either getting educators or forming them. First, I tried to find
               them, and I addressed myself to two communities of Sisters in Italy, since in this matter of the
               education of girls gathered into an Institute, we cannot just flatter ourselves with the contrary.
               No private teacher will ever be equal to a Religious Sister who the religious Institution has
               already trained to be a mother, a teacher, a friend, and a sister to the young girls of every
               condition. The Sister-educator and mother of the pupils is one of the most beautiful signs that
               Christianity has offered at any time, especially in the last two centuries.
                       “I  understood  this  pressing  need  from  the  time  I  began  gathering  orphan  girls.
               However, the communities that I was wishing for my orphanage, that is the ‘Daughters of
               Charity’ or the ‘the Daughters of St. Anne’, did not accept my invitation, as I had no means of
               paying them.
                       “Then, I conceived a perhaps too bold, if not daring thought: that of myself forming a
               community of Sisters for the education of my little orphans.”
                       Obviously, the daring project went through the screening of critical tongues and Father
               Hannibal did not ignore it, “I know that biting criticisms were never lacking against this daring
               enterprise of the formation of a community of Sisters for the salvation of orphan girls. In truth,
               it would have been a wonder if there were no criticisms!
                       “Unfortunately, it is a truth that no one is a prophet in his own homeland, but I rather
               feared the criticisms of the future than that of today. I feared that tomorrow, after my death,
               this orphanage could fail, and then justified blame would befall my memory, as I had been
               unable to make this shelter of salvation for the poor and orphan girls stable and lasting. The
               continuation of this work of beneficence was at the top of my thoughts, and it was one of the
               main aims of my poor efforts. To achieve this important purpose, I needed a community of
               Sisters, and since I could neither get the ‘Daughters of Charity’ nor the ‘the Daughters of St.
               Anne’, I thought of forming the ‘Daughters of Divine Zeal’.
                       “However, how costly such work is! It is not easy to understand how difficult such
               enterprises are. If only those who once were criticizing me knew the difficulties that I had to
               go through for the formation of this Congregation of Sisters! How I had to freeze and sweat at
               the same time when I was receiving crowds of orphan girls and boys from the city, from the
               province, and from the municipality! Having to grant success to so many girls and at the same
               time to form their educators and teachers!
                       “Gentlemen, it was a hard endeavor, an immensely difficult challenge for me, as I have
               the highest concept of the modern Religious Sister! Today, she is no longer enclosed within
               four walls. She is in close contact with society, she has to answer the demands of a critical,

               6. The Year of Blessings

                       In the nascent community, troubles were not lacking as tribulations accompany all the
               works of the Lord. On the contrary, they are the seal of the divine delights.
                                                         9
                       First of all, a separation took place , which increased the already existing prejudices
               against Father Hannibal and his work, including the biases even of the Diocesan Clergy of
               Messina.



                  9  The nature of this book does not allow a broad and exhaustive exposition of the facts, but I believe that some
               clarifications may be needed so as not to alter the truth.
                  In 1897, Fr. Francesco Di Francia, who had been helping from time to time in Avignone for nine years, left
               his  brother  Hannibal.  Differences  in  ideas  about  administration  were  the  basis  of  a  painful  situation  in  the
               Institution, and thus the separation became necessary.
                  Certainly, the governance of Father Hannibal was peculiar and original. Mons. Di Tommaso, Bishop of Oria
               perfectly classified it in these words: “His administration was that of a Saint. It would look rather imprudent,
               because  he  was  daring,  endlessly  trusting  in  the  Providence.”  Now  we  must  honestly  recognize  that  such
               governance is not ordinary, and if requires a particular vocation in those who exercise it and no less in those who
               submit to it. Certain positions require heroism; and this, obviously, is not for everyone! Indeed, we have to keep
               in mind that Father Hannibal cannot be judged with common criteria.
                  On May 4, 1895, the local periodical The Awakening (Il Risveglio) mentioned Father Hannibal as a man of the
               temper of Cottolengo. Those who read the life of that Saint will know how many troubles he went through because
               others wanted to measure him with the human meter. The Father never left the community lacking what was
               necessary. In addition, regarding the spiritual aspect, piety, and interior life of those entrusted to him, he cultivated
               them with all the effort, to the point of being accused of exaggerating. However, it was necessary to see him by
               putting one’s self in his shoes in order to judge his actions properly.
                  Here lies the intimate origin of the division that happened in the community of the Daughters of Divine Zeal
               at that time. Fighting for survival every day, as it happened in Avignone, and being always with nothing in facing
               what  seemed  impossible  because  the  Father's  generosity  gave  everything  to  the  poor  made  life  impossible,
               humanly speaking, for some of those young Sisters. Had the matter been limited to the material sacrifice of the
               intimidating work and the unceasing begging, perhaps they could have adjusted to it. But, as they said, the peace
               of the spirit was endangered because they did not find in the community that material order and regularity of
               practices, which are a duty and a privilege of the well-settled Institutes. However, they did not realize that such
               conditions could not be expected in the embryonic state of Father Hannibal’s Institution. They wanted a new set
               up and meanwhile animosity and discontent were spreading in the community. Fr. Francesco had referred those
               young Sisters to Father Hannibal, thus they brought their complaints to Fr. Francesco. He shared their ideas and
               so it is not correct to say that he was collaborating with Hannibal ‘with the docility of a loving child rather than
               of a brother’ (FELICI, page 81). The community was thus divided into two, and Fr. Francesco considered it right
               to support his protégés.
                  I perfectly agree with I. Felici, that ‘this cannot surprise us at all’; ... it was just like that, and it was always
               painful. Sister Veronica of the Child Jesus, whose original name was Natala Briguglio, stood out among the young
               Sisters who aspired to change the situation.
                  The community was deeply divided; and speaking of ‘misunderstandings, persecutions and even slanders’ at
               the expenses of Sister Veronica and the lack of a ‘spiritual director capable of understanding and guiding her’ (I.
               FELICI,  p.  197)  certainly  does  not  clarify  the  situation  and  much  less  adequately  explains  the  solution  that
               followed.
                  There were appeals to the Ecclesiastical Authority and Cardinal. Guarino, with a letter of August 3, 1896,
               deposed the Superior, Sister M. Carmela D'Amore. However, things did not change, because the new Superior,
               Sister M. Nazzarena Maione, was close to the Founder no less than Sister D'Amore.
                  The discontented Sisters thought it was better to separate. At night, without any notice, passing through the
               Church door, on March 11, 1897, (not 1895: this is also an important correction!) they went to Roccalumera, a
               village in the Province of Messina, and remained there under the guidance of Fr. Francesco.

               escaped from the orphanage with the consequent intervention of the police. This became the
               last straw, and the Vicar General, Mons. Basile decreed the suppression of the Institute.

                       The influential intervention of a venerable Friar Minor, Fr. Bernardo from Portosalvo,
               obtained  the  deferral  of  the  decree  and  a  year  of  trial  was  granted  to  Father  Hannibal’s
               Institutions. In that year, he was able to get as a collaborator of the Institution in the person of
               Melanie Calvat, the famous shepherdess, to whom the great Mother of God had appeared at
               the mountain of La Salette on September 19, 1846. Melanie remained in the Institute for one
               year, from September 14, 1897 to October 2, 1898, and the Father called that year ‘truly a year
               of blessing’. The trial was happily overcome, the community received a vigorous thrust, and
               the life of the female Congregation was assured.
                       Father Hannibal attributed all this to Our Lady. On May 25, 1897, a wooden statue,
               venerated in the chapel of the Sisters, perspired profusely, so much so that small pieces of cloth
               were  soaked.  A  woodcarver,  Antonino  Saccà,  invited  by  the  Vicar  General  to  study  the
               phenomenon, declared it could not be explained scientifically. Father Di Francia interpreted
               the event of the perspiration in some verses that he put into the lips of Jesus, conversing with
               the Congregation of the Daughters of Divine Zeal:


                       Sad were those days! My Mother then
                       From the image in the chapel
                       Trickled drops, like someone on the street
                       Perspiring exhausted. Thus, She was perspiring too!
                       For you She perspired, to ask from me salvation,
                       For you She perspired, to drive Satan away;
                       She seemed to cry with you, sharing
                       With you the bitterness of the recent trouble!

























                  These are how the Providence, admirably pursues its mysterious designs. From that modest group came a
               beautiful and prosperous religious Congregation, the Tertiary Capuchin Sisters of the Sacred Heart.
                  Concluding,  I  would  like  to  highlight:  1)  The  separation  of  the  Works  did  not  affect  at  all  the  fraternal
               sentiments  of  Father  Hannibal  towards  Fr.  Francesco.  2)  Until  his  death,  Father  Hannibal  was  a  constant
               benefactor of the Sisters of his brother. Sister Veronica said of him, “He admired our community. The best gifts
               of his great heart were for us”. 3) The sons and daughters of Father Hannibal perpetuate his admiration for the
               daughters of Fr. Francesco with best wishes and prayers for their prosperity in the Lord.

                                             THE 1908 EARTHQUAKE





               1. The Little Orphan Girls of Fr. Sollima

                       Soon, the female branch of the Institution moved from the Avignone neighborhood. By
               then, the Institute had become too small for the Work that was developing. The number of girls
               had increased because of the orphan girls of Fr. Sollima, a pious priest, who at his death, had
               left his orphanage in danger of being disbanded. Father Hannibal accepted those girls into his
               Institute. At first, he transferred them to the Brunaccini Palace, a historical building that had
               housed Goethe; and afterward, in 1895, to their definite place in the Holy Spirit monastery,
               which he had obtained from the municipality. Initially, they stayed there temporarily and then
               later in a rental.



               2. In Thirty Seconds...

                       Then came the earthquake on December 28, 1908.
                       Father Hannibal wrote, “It was an immense catastrophe which has no equal to any
               similar historical events because only in the populated and splendid city of Messina with its
               120,000 inhabitants, 80,000 remained under the debris, buried under the ruins of their own
               houses.
                       “In  about  thirty  seconds,  the  civil,  commercial,  industrial,  religious,  monumental,
               popular, beautiful, smiling, and artistic Messina disappeared. The waves of her blue sea which
               washed over those famous shores now strewn with rubble and the slow lapping seemed to be
               crying over the destiny of the ancient city, against which the finger of God’s justice had pushed
               them, almost to swallow it!
                       “My dear fellow citizens, had you died in the battlefields brandishing your weapons for
               God and for the homeland! Had you died as martyrs of our Lord in the persecutions and
               assaults of the enemies of faith! Instead, in the darkness of the night, from the quiet of your
               sleep, you felt jolted by the sudden shaking of the earth. You saw the doors of your homes
               waving like sails exposed to the winds, amidst the loud thundering of the crashing buildings
               and  the  clouds  of  suffocating  dust,  and  found  yourselves  either  crushed  under  a  boulder,
               bleeding under a beam, or squashed and compressed between the roofs and the floors! Oh,
               children of my homeland, victims of the sudden outburst of God’s wrath, how painful were your
               cries, wailings, and agonies in those supreme moments, in the grasp of such a cruel death!
               Your voices were coming even from under those wrecks, imploring for help. But for you, who
               perished under there, there was no help; men were numb, maybe even friends and relatives
               who survived were terrified, on the run, and abandoned you!...”

                       Father Hannibal used the earthquake as an opportunity to counter the objection of the
               unbelievers or of the man of little faith, who, in the face of such a terrifying spectacle, did not
               think of God, but referred to it as fate or nature. “For us, fate and nature are just the secondary
               causes, wholly regulated and moved by the omnipotent First Cause who is God. They represent
               the coexistence of sin and its punishment predisposed ever since by the infinite mind of the
               Most High. He makes the two elements meet at the same pre-set point, the moral one of the
               faults that fill the measure, and the natural, physics, terrestrial, or human aspect of disaster,
               earthquake, war, famine, or scourge. For us believers, when God works this way, He is not
               cruel or unjust, but He is very perfect, holy, and compassionate.” Quoting the words of the
               Scripture, “even in his anger, he is merciful,” the Father was thinking of the countless souls the
               divine mercy had saved by that scourge.

               4. God’s Scourge Repeatedly Announced

                       The earthquake was a scourge that Father Hannibal had foreseen and announced several
               times. It seemed that the Lord had appointed him as the Prophet, with the mission of recalling
               his city to the ways of goodness through the threat of divine punishment. He had published and
               widely distributed a pamphlet of considerations and prayers entitled ‘The Protection from the
               Divine Scourges’. This topic frequently occurred in his preaching.
                       Every year the city of Messina used to hold a propitiatory celebration, established by
               means  of  a  vote  of  the  City’s  Senate  after  the  earthquake  of  February  5,  1783.  Later,  the
               remembrance was transferred to November 16 because of the terrible tremor that occurred on
               that day in 1894. It was evidently a miracle of our Lady’s protection that Messina was not
               destroyed. Several times, Father Hannibal was requested to preach on that occasion, and he did
               it with the utmost freedom. He looked like a prophet sent to announce bitter news (1 Kings
               14:6)  to  his  fellow  citizens.  His  last  sermon  for  the  somber  circumstance  goes  back  to
               November 16, 1905, and left a deep impression on the vast audience of the cathedral.
                       The Father cried, “I must accomplish my holy ministry! And in no uncertain terms,
               without reticence and fear, I tell you, my fellow citizens, that Messina is under the threat of
               God’s punishments ... The punishments are upon us and the Angel of the divine vengeance
               already twirls his exterminating sword.” He announced a strong and exterminating earthquake.
               While on one hand, he exhorted to trust in the divine mercy, which would save the people
               living according to the Divine Law and abandoning themselves to God’s hands, on the other,
               he explicitly announced that for the whole city he saw no way of survival. “The salvation
               should be the same that the Ninevites found at the preaching of Jonah. What did then the
               Ninevites do? Beginning with their king, everyone, including the animals, made penance with
               sackcloth, cilice, and fasting, etc. Messina is not doing this. This means that there is no escape
               for the whole city; the punishment is inevitable... “

                       As  Father  Hannibal  announced  the  Lord’s  punishment,  these  were  the  spiritual
               sentiments of the prophet. “If the threats of God’s wrath, which I have come to proclaim, must
               be fulfilled, if the Lord has chosen me for the dreadful office of preparing you for the burst of
               his divine lightning on this sinful City, I will not try to run away from the Lord’s face, like
               Jonah. However, like Jonah to the sailors, I will say to the Holy Angels and you all, ‘Pick me
               up, and hurl me into the sea, and then the sea will calm down!’ (Jon 1:12). O, Lord may the
               useless  sacrifice  of  my  life  be  enough  for  you,  provided  you  spare  this  city  from  your
               punishments!”
                       God did not accept his offering and Messina was destroyed.

                       We will not dwell on describing the horrible scene of that bloody dawn. However,
               divine protection became visible in an impressive manner.
                       There were no victims in the male Institute. When the dormitory collapsed, only the
               part of the roof, over which the orphan boys gathered in a corner in front of the image of the
               Virgin Mary to say the morning prayers, did not cave in! The same thing happened in the small
               chapel where the Religious were having their meditation. The roof fell, but the part under which
               they were praying remained intact.
                       In  the  female  House,  all  the  orphan  girls  were  also  spared,  with  evident  divine
               protection. “Amidst the terrible shaking and falling walls, amidst the thick darkness, the girls
               found their way to safety, gathering into groups in the garden. As the wall collapsed, a thirteen-
               year-old girl was thrown into the street, where she would have been crushed into pieces had
               she not stumbled on a balcony where she remained unhurt. A little five-year-old girl did not
               even notice it. She was shielded by some beams that crossed over her bed in the attic, and when
               she opened her eyes and crawled out of the wreckage, waiting for somebody to take her out,
               she excused herself to the Sister for not having heard the morning wake-up bell!”



               6. The Victims

                       However, there were victims; and the Lord chose them among the Sisters. St. Anthony
               wanted thirteen of them, his symbolic number: thirteen lamps that consumed themselves to
               obtain from the Divine Mercy the salvation of the Institutes.
                       Father Hannibal remembers them with expressions full of fatherly tenderness, “Dearest
               daughters!  They  were  thirteen  little  lambs  of  this  mystical  fold!  They  were  very  humble,
               obedient to any command, very respectful towards their superiors, very consistent in receiving
               the holy sacraments. Among them, some maintained the House with their works and sacrifices;
               some were models of docility and patience in the most humble and practical works; some also
               had a bright mind, with artistic skills, studying fine arts and works, with the sole purpose of
               giving glory to God, to console the Sacred Heart of Jesus and their superiors, and to augment
               their own Institute. They were very faithful people, intent on their own sanctification...! Dearest
               daughters, you were very dear to the Heart of Jesus. You too suffered the terrible pains of such
               a cruel death, maybe even prolonged under the heap of wreckage, without human help and
               comfort!  Now  you  rejoice  there,  in  the  kingdom  of  the  chosen  ones,  where  your  heavenly
               bridegroom, I hope, has already placed on your finger the ring of the eternal wedding, and
               clothed you with the mantle of His glory!”
                       Later, Father Hannibal lit thirteen silver lamps in the chapel of the Holy Spirit, each
               with the name of the deceased Sister.


               7. My God! My Messina! My Children!

                       The earthquake was a very heavy blow to the heart of Father Hannibal. He was in Rome
               and learned of the event from the newspapers at ten o’clock on Tuesday morning, December
               29. He was shocked. He raised his eyes to heaven, “My God! My Messina! My children!” He
               left right away on the ferryboat Scilla, where, luckily, he was able to secure a seat in Naples.


                                                           53]]></page><page Index="54"><![CDATA[He wrote, “My heart was depressed and I resigned myself to the divine will. I blessed
               the just wrath of the Almighty and in tears, I prayed for the survivors and the victims, among
               whom I figured were all my children in Christ!” He reached the port of Messina at four o’clock
               on Thursday afternoon, December 31. From the ship, facing the mounds of ruins under which
               Messina was buried. He searched with his eyes the place of his Institutes and raised a hand
               tracing the sign of the cross. The General Superior of the Daughters of Divine Zeal, Mother
               Maria Nazzarena Maione, who was with the community in front of the Blessed Sacrament
               exposed for  adoration in a makeshift shanty, felt a sudden intuition and said, “The Father is at
               the port and he is blessing us!”
                       Messina was in a state of calamity, and no one could enter. Father Hannibal had to
               proceed to Catania, where he obtained a permit to return to Messina. He was among his children
               on the evening of January 5, at the end of the triduum of prayers by the community to obtain
               his return.


               8. Mary Wants Us to Rise Again!


                       As Father Hannibal had insisted on anticipating the divine scourge, with the same zeal,
               after the earthquake, he did not get tired of continuously raising the downcast spirit of his fellow
               citizens, rekindling in them in a particular way the trust in the protection of Our Lady.
                       In the wooden chapel built on the rubble of Piazza Cairoli, on June 3, 1909, on the feast
               of the patron of Messina, Our Lady of the Letter, he gave a sermon showing that Our Lady had
               kept her promise of perpetual protection. “God and Mary abandon us when they let us do what
               we want! On the slope where she had put herself, Messina would have perished had God left
               her alone. Her faith would have failed. However, if God struck her, it means that He wants to
               save her. This is the protection of Mary Most Holy. The Scripture is full of these examples,
               which are reflected in that divine word: ‘I chastise and punish those I love’.”
                       On June 12, at the inauguration of the reconstructed Shrine of Our Lady of Montalto,
               Father Hannibal proclaimed what the new Messina must be, “Mary wants us to rise again. This
               Sanctuary is proof of this. What is the rising again that Mary wants? Jesus Christ said: ‘I am
               the resurrection and the life’. The resurrection of a people cannot be but Jesus Christ. Through
               Mary, we go to Jesus. The resurrection of Messina cannot come except with the return of Jesus
               Christ. Therefore, each of us shall truly return with our hearts to Jesus through Mary. Those
               who do not return to Jesus are enemies of themselves, of Mary, and of Messina. Those who do
               not return to Jesus want their destruction and that of the city! Let this never happen! Let us
               have  compassion  on  ourselves  and  on  this  city,  which  is  laying  down  disheartened  and
               surrounded by ruins. Here, however, Mary, the morning star, appears again. Here is the dawn
               of our triumphs! Here is the Catholic Messina! And it is only with the Catholic Messina that
               the commercial, artistic, industrial, historical, scientific, and literary Messina can rise again
               because nothing can be restored if not in Christ, and we cannot reach out to Christ if not
               through Mary!”

                                                                                                         *
                       The  first  personal  contact  of  Father  Hannibal  with  the  great  Don  Luigi  Orione,
               happened on the occasion of the 1908 earthquake.
                       The relationship through correspondence goes back to 1900, when Father Di Francia
               heard of the apostolic works of Don Orione who, at that time, was a young priest. On July 18
               of that year, the Father wrote to him,
                        “Rev. Father and dearest brother, through His Excellency Mons. Blandini, Bishop of
               Noto, I came to know how your Reverence, though still young, has dedicated himself body and
               soul, mind, and heart to the service of our Lord Jesus Christ. You are zealous and fervent for
               the salvation of souls, which are the precious pearls that Jesus Christ has acquired at the
               inestimable cost of his priceless blood.
                       “This news has flooded my disconsolate heart with an intimate, deep, and immense joy!
                       “Since then, undeservingly, I never ceased keeping you in my weak, useless, and poor
               prayers every day, asking our beloved Lord to enkindle you evermore with the unquenchable
               flames of His love and zeal, by giving you always more strength, vigor, ardor, fervor, courage,
               virtue, and constancy to work in the mystical vineyard where his laborers are so scarce!
                       “I would be very honored, my dear brother, if you would send me an esteemed letter
               and let me know if and when you will pass by Messina, as I would like to see you personally,
               embrace and kiss you in Jesus Christ, the beloved of our hearts
                       “As every day with the greatest fervor I can, I talk about you with my Supreme Lord
               and Eternal God, so I beg you to recommend me to the very merciful love of the Heart of Jesus
               while  kissing  again  your  sacred  hands  that  are  open  to  charity,  mercy,  assistance,  and
               salvation of the children and many souls. Very humbly, I declare myself as your useless and
               humble servant, Canon Hannibal Mary Di Francia.”

                       However, it seems that the two Saints did not meet before the 1908 earthquake. A
               misadventure similar to that experienced by Father Hannibal happened also to Don Orione with
               the desertion of the clerics. In 1902, the Bishop of Tortona ordered the clerics of Don Orione
               to enter the seminary, and so a dozen of his children, raised with the bread of his table and with
               the warmth of his charity, left the Congregation on the eve of their priesthood. (Cf. The Servant
               of God Fr. Gaspare Cocci, of the Sons of the Divine Providence, p.175). This event caused the
               closure of several Houses among them the one of Noto, and so Don Orione had no reason to
               travel to Sicily.


               10. We Appoint You as Our Superior General

                       Because  of  the  earthquake,  Don  Orione  came  to  Messina  first  as  a  member  of  the
               Pontifical Committee for the assistance to the people affected by the earthquake, and later, from
               June 17, 1909 to February 7, 1912, as Vicar General of the Diocese, appointed directly by Pope
               Pius X.

                       The Father was very glad and never failed to pay tribute to the new Superior, by writing
               from Sava (Taranto) on September 18, 1909, a letter worthy of mention.
                       “From this moment, we are all subject to your wise direction and we proclaim Your
               Lordship as our Superior General. Kindly embrace in your apostolic heart this other Work as
               one of yours and lead it to the way of its twofold purpose of religion and charity, with your

               in every House, is ready to obey you, with the assistance of our Lord.
                       “I hope that the Sacred Heart of Jesus may grant us those graces that my unworthiness
               could not obtain and will repair all the evil I have committed.
                       “I present to Your Lordship, together with the personnel of our seven little Houses, that
               sacred banner on which is written: ‘Pray, therefore, the Lord ofthe harvest to send out laborers
               into his harvest.’ This divine word coming from the divine zeal of the Heart of Jesus is the
               mandate of his divine zeal in which the great secret of the salvation of the Church and society
               is contained. May Your Lordship accept it from the beloved lips of the divine Savior, as we
               received and impressed it in our hearts and constituted it as our very holy mission. May you
               be its apostle and announcer!
                       “I ask your holy blessing and kiss your hands while declaring myself your very humble
               servant, Canon Hannibal Mary Di Francia.”
                       The bonds in the love of our Lord that united the two Saints in an indissoluble manner
               were  thus  established.  I  myself  remember  that  my  first  acquaintance  with  Don  Orione  is
               connected with this relationship.

                       Fr. Vitale introduced him to us, students, in Messina, with these words, “Here is Don
               Orione, the friend of our Father.” Don Orione underlined with pleasure, with a wide smile on
               his lips, and with the flashing of his large eyes, which were his characteristics, “Friend, yes,
               indeed a true friend!”
                       Father Hannibal in the ‘Book of the Divine Benefits’, in the year 1909, defines his
               encounter with the Apostle of the Divine Providence this way, “This year we had a special
               closeness with Don Orione; he showed great affection and protection for us.”

                               THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE INSTITUTES





               1. In Apulia

                       The  earthquake  of  Messina  could  have  destroyed  the  Work  of  Father  Hannibal  Di
               Francia. Instead, in God’s plans, it fostered its greater development. In reality, the small plant
               of the Rogate had produced new sprouts in Taormina, since 1902, with the girls’ orphanage in
                                                                                    *
               the former convent of the Capuchins, and in the nearby town of Giardini,  with a daycare center
               for young girls and a school of arts and crafts, which thrived in a short time.
                       In November 1908, Father Hannibal was in Apulia for a preaching tour in Francavilla
               (Brindisi),  in  the  diocese  of  Oria,  and  there,  through  the  mediation  of  the  Bishop,  Mons.
               Antonio di Tommaso, he started the negotiations for the purchase of the former convent of the
               “Alcantarini” known as ‘San Pasquale’.

                       After the earthquake, the majority of the community, at least for some time, could not
               remain in Messina, and thus moved to Francavilla.



                       2. Two Conflicting Emotions

                       In the speech introducing his orphans to the authorities and the people of Francavilla,
               on January 31, 1909, Father Hannibal revealed his feelings about that event, “The day when I
               left Messina, together with the little orphans that you see here now, I felt inside myself two
               conflicting emotions struggling in my heart like the twins in the womb of Rebekah. I had to say,
               “Farewell Messina, farewell my dear homeland, so miserably perished! My little orphans,
               whom you loved so much, will no longer walk through your streets obstructed by mounds of
               ruins! In your churches already destroyed, you will no longer see these children whom you
               assisted with your alms! The remaining people of Messina who were camping under the tents
               amidst mud and rain along San Martino Boulevard saw these children rushing to the already
               steaming boat, shook their heads, and sighed as they learned that they were leaving Messina.
               All this caused deep pain for me, a son of Messina. I wish I could go back, return my little
               orphans to their place of battle and sacrifice... However, like a faraway vision, Francavilla
               appeared to me! I stifled in my heart the reasons for my pain as a son of the land that saw my
               birth and my growth. When the train moved from the territory of the equally unfortunate Reggio
               to transport us here speedily, I had to stifle my sufferings, to give way to reasons of trust and
               happiness in the Lord. Here we are, now, among you, people of Francavilla! You will be the
               home of these children. Nourish them in your bosom. You will be their new benefactors. Take
               care of them, their needs, and their future! They were children of Messina, the now become
               children of Francavilla. They were children of the ‘Holy Virgin of the Sacred Letter’, they will
               now be the devout children of ‘Most Holy Mary of the Fountain’.”

               the convent of San Pasquale, the Rogationists took possession of it on September 28 of the
               same year.



               3. The Blessings of the Holy Father Pius X

                       The female community was in agony. There were frequent illnesses and even deaths.
               At the inauguration of the House of Oria, Father Hannibal, on October 7, implored the apostolic
               blessing for the new foundation from the Holy Father, and recommended the sick girls to his
               prayers:
                       “I come to your feet for two graces. First, I would like to let you know that, with due
               permission of Bishop Mons. Di Tommaso, I purchased a very beautiful and large convent,
               which formerly belonged to the Alcantarini Fathers, in Oria. Now, together with my confreres,
               I humbly plead your Holiness to accompany our entrance into that sacred dwelling with your
               fatherly, merciful, and apostolic blessing. May our dwelling now in this sacred abode, for the
               present and the future, be fully acceptable to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.
                       Second,  let  me  humbly  inform  your  Holiness  that  for  some  time  now,  the  just  and
               supreme Lord is visiting our female religious community with frequent and long illnesses as
               well as with some deaths among the superiors and the Sisters who are most needed for the
               proper running of the Houses.
                       Now, we all plead the mercy of your Holiness to make for us a special prayer in the
               great sacrifice of the Holy Mass and particularly to bless these communities. May the Almighty
               not look at my sins and be merciful to us with the healing of the sick Sisters, if this pleases the
               Divine Heart, through the intercession of His Most Holy Mother.”
                       The illnesses and deaths stopped within a short time. Reasonably,  Father Hannibal
               attributed this benefit to the prayers and blessings of St. Pius X.


               4. San Pier Niceto


                       The House in San Pier Niceto (Messina) was opened on October 24, 1909, through the
               generous help of the Vicar Forane, Fr. Francesco Antoniuccio. He offered his own house,
               properties, the small church built by him in honor of the Virgin of the Rosary of Pompeii, and
               his  entire  activities  for  the  service  of  the  foundation.  Two  of  his  sisters  even  entered  the
               Daughters of Divine Zeal. One of them, Sister Mary Paracleta, was truly appreciated in the
               Congregation.


               5. Father Hannibal’s Criteria for Foundations


                       It is worth mentioning the criteria which guided Father Hannibal in his foundations. We
               refer to what he wrote to the Sisters.

                       First, it is essential to prepare a suitable staff. “Let the Superior take care of forming
               the spirit and minds of the Sisters, their skills for works, for performing their tasks, and what
               it  takes  to  become  a  perfect  Sister.”  He  gives  a  golden  rule,  which  is  the  great  secret  for



                                                           58]]></page><page Index="59"><![CDATA[vocations  and  for  properly  promoting  an  Institute,  “Consider  that  when  the  spiritual,
               intellectual,  and  domestic  formation  is  well  done,  our  Lord  always  sends  new  and  good
               vocations  for  the  Institute  to  progress  well,  and  to  become  an  Ark  of  salvation  and
               sanctification for those who join it.
                       “The foundation should not be considered in a spirit of ambition, casualness, vanity,
               and vainglory. This would be a crime and the Lord will not bless this behavior.
                       “Let the Sisters be as ready as soldiers at the hint of their military superiors. Starting
               with their Superior, let them be attentive when the Lord will manifest his will to start new
               foundations, always for the divine glory, the greatest pleasure of the most holy Heart of Jesus,
               and the salvation of souls, so as to work in the Holy Church, that is, the mystical field of God
               the Father”.
                       Upon  receiving  news  about  the  foundation  let  communities  “immediately  begin
               novenas, other prayers, and celebrations of most Holy Masses, at least for a month.
                       “It is certainly necessary to examine the means of subsistence which the new foundation
               offers, but we must not expect that the income is fixed and corresponds to the needs of the
               orphans; there must also be a room for some gaps, for what we can add with our own revenues
               and for what the Divine Providence grants. That is why we must have great trust in Providence.
               However,  we  should  not  go  to  the  excesses  of  tempting  it,  by  undertaking  foundations  of
               orphanages where, humanly speaking, there is little or nothing to hope for. In everything, take
               the correct middle course.”



               6. Foundations in the Small Towns

                       What about a foundation in a small town? Does it have a chance for subsistence and
               development? In this case, a foundation may be accepted with love, even when it is preferred
               to a foundation in big centers, especially if in that small town there is neither an Institution of
               Sisters nor there is a different Congregation. Our Lord wants us to work for the good of people
               who need it most, and perhaps are more docile than those of the big cities and of the children
               of important people. Keep in mind what has been mentioned before, that the foundations must
               not be established  because of ambition, looking for big centers where the Institute may show
               off in front of people and make great profits, but humbly seeks the glory of our Lord Jesus
               Christ and the good of the poor not taken care of  by other institutions.”
                       Father Hannibal concludes with a wonderful encouragement for the Sisters destined to
               foundations like these, “Perhaps the missionary Sisters who go to the uncivilized lands of the
               unbelievers, go there for their own convenience? A foundation in a humble and poor center,
               provided that it can subsist, is a real mission, very pleasing to Jesus, the Good Shepherd who,
               over the mountains and fields, seeks here and there the scattered and forgotten sheep, easy
               prey of the infernal wolves. The Sisters of such a foundation should have much trust that the
               Lord will bless them and provide for them if they do not deviate from their vocation, but live
               always  with  the  initial  fervor,  with  the  spirit  of  sanctification,  and  bring  great  profit  to
               themselves and to the people entrusted to them.”


               7. Trani

                       In 1910 the Daughters of Divine Zeal opened a House in Trani (Bari), through the
               mediation of Archbishop Mons. Francesco Paolo Carrano, a great benefactor of that House. In
               April, the Sisters started a school of crafts for the girls but in the summer of that year, the city

               orphanage.
                       Father Hannibal widely acknowledged the merits of Mons. Carrano in the sermon for
               his priestly golden anniversary and his funeral eulogy when he died on March 17, 1915. Mons.
               Carrano had purchased the house, built a second floor, and helped with the initial expenses and
               granted  the  rentals  coming  from  the  shops,  storerooms,  and  rented  rooms  attached  to  the
               building.  Father Hannibal preserved his memory in a commemorative plaque.


               8. World War I (1915-1918)

                       World War I came with all its horrors. The male communities were decimated. The
               Houses of the Sisters survived with great difficulties. In 1915, following the donation of a pious
               religious woman, Sister Maria Rosario Jaculano, of the Daughters of Divine Zeal started a craft
               school and shop for young girls in St. Eufemia of Aspromonte (Reggio Calabria), which was
               followed by the opening of an orphanage.
                       In that same year, the Father wrote in his diary, “September 1915: purchase of a large
               extension of land in the neighborhood of Arcella, in Padua, where, if it pleases God, a great
               Institute will be built.”
                       Padua had always been a great dream of Father Hannibal. A foundation in the city of
               St. Anthony, beside his tomb, would have been a proof of love, devotion, and deep gratitude
               for the great Wonder-Worker who displayed such a great generosity and protection for the
               Father’s Works.
                       The words of the diary are a true prophecy. A modest building was immediately put up,
               which remained deserted for many years for various reasons, until a cluster of bombs destroyed
               it during World War II, leaving only a huge crater in that spot.
                       Indeed, the words of Father Hannibal did not vanish into thin air. A large Institute was
               built later, hosting the orphanage, a school, and a minor seminary, together with a beautiful
               adjacent parish church dedicated to Jesus, the Good Shepherd.
                        In 1916, Father Hannibal opened an orphanage in Altamura (Bari), for the children of
               the soldiers killed during the war. In that way, he meant to honor his homeland, for whose
               greatness her children had immolated their lives.


               9. The Temple of the Evangelical Rogation

                       Until the 1908 earthquake, the male community of Messina had only a semi-public
               chapel. Then, a beautiful wooden church was built, and Fr. Vitale inaugurated it on July 1,
               1910, in the absence of Father Hannibal. At that event Don Orione, who also participated in
               the adoration, together with Fr. Albera, the future bishop of Mileto, was present. It was the first
               church in the world that displayed on the top of its humble entrance, with ardent passion, the
               divine command in Latin, “Pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers to his
               harvest.”
                       Besides, it was, for the Rogationists the first sanctuary of St. Anthony to whom the
               heart of thousands of people conveyed their desires and vows. After about nine years of fruitful
               service, the church disappeared in the flames of an untamable fire at night before the Sunday
               in Albis, between April 26 and 27, 1919. Nothing remained. It was impossible even to rescue
               the Blessed Sacrament.

               beautiful house. Later, the beautiful Temple of Evangelical Rogation was built, rich in gold
               and marble, a true jewel of art. It was inaugurated on Easter morning, on April 4, 1926.

                       By  that  time,  however,  the  strength  of  Father  Di  Francia  was  slowly  failing.  He
               celebrated and preached in the Temple only twice, but his joy was immense, especially at the
               thought that the divine Rogate shone in the sun, in golden characters on the majestic facade, a
               reminder for all the faithful to obey always the command of the Sacred Heart.

                                                   THE EDUCATOR





               1. The Aim of Education

                       Father Hannibal wrote, “To gather children, to give them food, and then just let them
               vegetate, that is not establishing a house of education. It does not change the destiny of the
               scattered orphans and it does not prepare a future for the abandoned children of our people.
               Education must regenerate and edify the children taken away from vagrancy. And schooling
               must make them one day able to earn their bread of life honestly.”
                       We have to say something about Father Hannibal as an educator in order to have an
               adequate profile of his moral figure.
                       On December 31, 1929, Pius XI wrote, “education consists essentially in the formation
               of man, as he ought to be, and as he ought to behave in this earthly life to reach the ultimate
               purpose  for  which  he  was  created.  There  is  no  real  education  if  it  is  not  directed  to  this
               purpose.”
                       Father Hannibal did not read the Pope’s Encyclical Letter Divini Illius Magistri, which
               was published after his death, but his concept about the education of youth was not different.
               Some regulations that were written by him close with these words, “Let the young men learn
               to accomplish their duties towards God, towards themselves, and towards their neighbor. Thus,
               they will set themselves on the road leading to success, and what is more important, they will
               begin to work for their eternal salvation. Since everything passes away, each man was created
               for eternity and each Christian must always keep in mind his ultimate end which is the eternal
               salvation of his soul.”



               2. Religion as the Basis of Education

                       Religious education is the first component of education. In a talk given on January 31,
               1909, Father Hannibal expresses his thoughts, “I have been wearing out myself for thirty years
               to  gather  orphans  and  to  educate  them,  to  provide  for  their  future,  and  I  found  out  and
               experienced that religious education is the surest basis of any education. I touched with my
               hands this truth, taught to me by experience, by reason, by faith, and by the wisdom of all
               humankind that to form a civil and educated person, and a good citizen, we must form him as
               a Christian! If we teach the minds of the young in the large hall of knowledge, we must also
               teach the supreme principles of the Catholic faith. If we train the hands of the children of our
               people for arts and crafts, we need also to train their lips to prayer, to raise their minds to
               those pure realms of light in which there will be no distinction of ranks and social levels but
               only according to the virtues and merits of the Christian life. Nowadays, society goes to ruin
               because the basis of religion has been shaken, both for the education of the heart and in the
               teaching of the mind.”

                       The first great concern of Father Hannibal was to save the children’s innocence. He
               welcomed them when they were only five to seven years old, and kept them as the apple of his
               eyes. He cared for them with more than maternal attention and willingly and eagerly followed
               the progress of their studies, work, and above all of their virtues, which he wanted firmly and
               steadily anchored to the fear of God and resistant to the lure of passions. Therefore, in his
               Institutes, devotion was the first and unreplaceable means of formation, and prayer was felt as
               a need of the person as well as the frequent reception of the sacraments as channels of graces
               and sources of supernatural life.

                       First and above all, he requested that prayer be done especially by the educators to
               implore effectiveness in their apostolate. I recall an episode that happened in Rome with the
               first  orphan,  a  little  boy  of  five,  accepted  in  that  House.  He  was  insolent,  and  the  Sister
               presented him to Father Hannibal to ask forgiveness. The little boy, however, did not move.
               He remained stiff, cold, and as defiant as a five-year-old could be. The Father wrote to Fr.
               Vitale, “The Sister brought him to me to apologize. He stood in front of me like a dumb fish
               without  saying  a  word,  despite  the  suggestions  and  insistence  of  the  Sister.  He  was  not
               convinced that he was wrong!” Thus, he concluded, “Let us therefore pray, since without the
               divine grace it is not possible to bend the human will even of a five-year-old child.”
                       From the start of his orphanages, Father Hannibal had prescribed a daily prayer to the
               Most Holy Immaculate Virgin Mary for the success of the girls.


               4. The Example of the Educator


                       External discipline shall aim at facilitating the desire for grace and at cooperating with
               its action. We must surround the child with care, vigilance, continuous, and paternal assistance
               to place him in the moral impossibility of doing wrong. This is the preventive method and Don
               Bosco is its great teacher.
                       To apply this method correctly, Father Hannibal required the educators (Assistants) first
               of all “to shine in their observance, charity, zeal, the communion of heart, and Holy fervor.
               From these come the examples of virtue and holiness for the children and let their example,
               more than their words, imbue the tender minds of their charges!” Then he exemplifies, “The
               Assistant, who makes the sign of the cross without the attention and seriousness demanded by
               this act, shows the youth that, being aware or not, he treats the cross of Christ as nothing.”
               Those who murmur against the Superiors “absolutely deprive the youth of learning that there
               is a principle of divine authority, which is transmitted on earth to the creatures invested with
               the responsibility of an office.”


               5. Spirit of Sacrifice

                       Only those who appreciate persons and dedicate themselves generously to a life of
               sacrifice can be educators. “I will hold dear persons so much, that for the salvation of just one
               of them, I will deem it worthy to spend my life, even if it were to be entirely made of suffering
               and sacrifices.” He adds, “I will keep in mind that educating children is a work of continuous
               sacrifices, which require great self-denial, enduring inconveniences, deprivations, boredom,

               Christ.”
                       The education of children is indeed demanding. He wrote, “The education of children
               is ‘the highest form of art and science’ (Ars artium et scientia scientiarum). Very few know
               how to practice this, and a person has to be a philosopher, a theologian, a great expert of the
               human heart, and a saint to be the educator of a little child.”
                       Father Hannibal complained, “In the world, the ruin of souls in the families is ordinarily
               a massacre. Someone said that in the world, education can be defined as the most difficult art
               entrusted to the most inexperienced hands.”
                       The Father also said that all these reminders should not dishearten or discourage but
               rather increase the trust of the educators in the divine grace and their commitment to applying
               the educational rules given to them.



               6. Rules for Education

                       The rules are few, but they have to be rigorously applied.
                       First, love. The secret for the educators’ success is just this. “We must love the children
               with pure and holy love, in God, with profound understanding and charity, with tender and
               paternal care since this is the greatest secret to win the young people to God and to save them.”
               Father Di Francia insists, “The educators shall be loving persons and love will make them
               strong in suffering, working, and sacrificing themselves.”
                       Second, respect. “Educators shall have in their hearts a great affection and respect, in
               God, for all the poor orphans entrusted to them, considering them as persons very dear to the
               Lord, perhaps closer to the Heart of Jesus than themselves, though they are Religious, because
               of their innocence and poverty.” Therefore, “Children shall never be insulted. Educators shall
               never  get  angry  at  them  or  show  resentment  and  distrust.  That  would  be  the  same  as
               discouraging them and letting them become careless.”
                                                                                                     *
                       Then,  presence,  presence...The  preventive  system  “consists  of  ‘preventing’   the
               children who are educated... They must be supervised in a way that they have no space or
               liberty to become careless and do wrong. Thus, they shall be formed in a Christian and devout
               way, to have in themselves the holy fear of God, to be attentive and vigilant, and not to commit
               serious faults.”

                       “Supervision and assistance shall be for us the strictest kind of precept and obligation.
               Let the Superiors and their collaborators, each for his part, never lose sight of any child in the
               Church, workshops, school, and especially during recreation and in the dormitories.” The
               Assistant  “shall  always  supervise  all  the  gatherings  of  the  orphans,  and  none  of  their
               movement, action, or words must escape his attention. He will let them play, jump, make noise
               because they need to let off steam and this fosters their healthy development. He must also take
               care that they do not injure themselves, and do not start fighting and arguing. He must be
               vigilant that none of them, especially by two’s, seclude themselves at a distance or behind
               woods  or  trees  to  converse.  He  has  to  keep  all  under  his  sight  constantly,  in  the  same


               *  EN. Father Hannibal adopted the “Preventive Method” or “Preventive System” developed by Don Bosco in his
               educational institutions. It is called “preventive” to contrast it with the “repressive” method. While the preventive
               method  focuses  on  the  active  and  positive  accompaniment  of  a  child  in  the  process  of  integral  maturity  by
               “avoidance” and “prevention” of occasions that can lead to one’s detriment, employing loving presence, friendly
               reminders, fraternal/paternal warnings, reasoning out on the regulations. The “repressive” method, on the other
               hand, focuses on police-like surveillance, discipline, and corporal “punishments” for mistakes committed.

               concludes with a very important reminder. “The devil is always after the perversion of the
               children and, with the greatest attention, the Assistant must foil all the deceits of Satan and
               guard the children entrusted to him like an angel, to give them back spotless to our Lord.”



               7. Punishments and Rewards

                       Sometimes, punishment becomes necessary, “because from adolescence, human nature
               is inclined to evil,” as Father Hannibal remarks, referring to a text of the Sacred Scripture.
                       “Punishment, however, shall never be frequent, nor disproportionate to the fault, like
               medicine which, if given to the sick person beyond the proper dosage, will do more harm than
               good, and it may even kill.” Besides, “if taken too frequently, medicines lose their effectiveness,
               because the person gets used to them and then the dosage must be increased... However, this
               cannot  be  done  with  punishments.  In  an  educational  Institute  run  by  Religious  personnel,
               punishment must never reach the point where the children do not give importance to them, and
               thus the Institute becomes a correctional facility.” According to Father Hannibal and Don
               Bosco, and in line with the preventive method “the main punishment shall be a simulated
               withdrawal of affection, keeping away the child as he approaches, not welcoming him, and
               showing him that he is not loved anymore.”
                       The  attraction  of  a  reward  is  the  natural  motivation  to  let  a  child  do  well.  Father
               Hannibal held every year a solemn awarding ceremony for the pupils with “encouragement
               and entertainment”. The award shall not be limited to a diploma or medals but has to be made
               concrete into a bank account, so that “when the children leave the Institute at the proper age,
               the money will be handed to them.”


               8. Work


                       The pupils, however, must prepare themselves for life and learn to earn their livelihood
               honestly. Thus, the need for work in the educational set up. In one of his talks, Father Hannibal
               points out the importance of work. “Boys and girls must get used to work. In an educational
               setting, housework is among the main factors of morality, order, discipline, and life. It is an
               anticipation of a successful future for the pupils. They learn in time to earn their bread by the
               sweat of their brows. There can be neither religious nor civil education disassociated from
               work. ‘Pray and work’ (Ora et Labora), was the motto adopted by the western monks as their
               mode of life. Even though they were dedicated to a life of transcendent asceticism, they still
               proclaimed that there is no firmness of religious principles where there is no work.”

                       Father  Hannibal’s  criteria  did  not  allow  misunderstanding  on  this  point.  “I  always
               considered that an Institution for the education of the youth, where besides the children there
               are also boys and girls capable of working. If it sustains itself only through alms, it would
               resemble exactly a vigorous young man who, instead of working, wants to live by begging. A
               charitable institution can beg for donations, within certain limits, only when it has pupils
               incapable of working, like blind, crippled, old men, or children of tender age. Moreover, to
               rely only on alms for institutions for the young of both sexes would be prejudicial to correct
               educational orientation.”
                       Furthermore, in the above-mentioned talk to the ladies of the Messina aristocracy who
               visited the female orphanage on August 20, 1906, he asked for work for the orphan girls, “They

               work. Ladies, I ask work from you! Although the group of little girls, which never lack in my
               orphanage, may have more of a right to your donations than those already trained to work,
               they do not want to live on alms. They want to work, even if they have to lessen their hours of
               sleep, provided that they can work and that, while eating their daily meal, they can say: ‘We
               earned it! May God bless our benefactresses who gave us a profitable work.’”

                                                     THE FATHER





               1. They Call Me Father...

                       They call me Father: on their head,
                       As God’s Minister, I lay my hand…


                       On the lips of everyone, ‘Father’ was the spontaneous and natural way of addressing
               Father Hannibal who poured over everyone the wave of that fatherly tenderness overflowing
               from the priesthood of Jesus Christ.
                       The miserable conditions of the abandoned children of the lower class of people was a
               sad and dark sight, which never left his mind. He cared for the girls in unique way. “Poor
               creatures  amidst  the  turmoil  of  an  evil  and  disorderly  world,  in  times  when  innocence  is
               exposed to so many dangers. They are small daughters born to the poor and gloomy condition
               of destitute families where misery and poverty add to ignorance about religion and human
               dignity, deprived as they are of the paternal and maternal assistance ahead of time... What a
               sight of tears and horror! These girls would find themselves dirty and ragged in the stench of
               some hovel, suffering from hunger, cold, and the hostility and wrath of vulgar relatives, venting
               on them their resentment and grief for their extreme poverty.”
                       In  his  poems,  Father  Hannibal  pointed  out  the  pitiful  condition  of  the  abandoned
               children:

                       Gentle flowers of this land, though newly born
                       Depths were ready to swallow them;
                       There was no gaze of loving people
                       To bring them joy at least for a while.
                       Scattered dear children, on their own way

                       With no love, liveliness, or smiles in store for them;
                       Alas, what a future, what a fate
                       Would have hurt and crushed them!

                       According to Fr. Vitale (p. 666), “therefore the main object of Father Hannibal’s loving
               attention were the boys and girls. How he looked at them, their faces, their eyes, even their
               tongue to see if they might have some illness! When a boy or a girl looked pale, they were to
               be given a particular food. When some showed signs of anemia, they were to be prescribed a
               tonic treatment. If a boy seemed unable to tolerate the lead of the printing shop, he was to be
               trained for another job. Other times, a girl had to be exempted from working in the bakery or
               another from the laundry or heavy works.”

                       Father  Hannibal  used  to  remind  everyone  that,  in  accepting  children  we  commit
               ourselves not only to educate them but to care also for their spiritual good. We also assume the
               serious obligation to protect, safeguard, and improve their physical health.
                       He was very demanding at this point. He wrote, “Regarding hygiene, I can flatter myself
               a  little  bit.  I  am  a  follower  of  Dr.  Kneipp.  I  read  the  Mantegazza’s  treatise,  and  I  am
               scrupulously demanding when it comes to hygiene. In our refectories, we have moral, hygienic,
               and etiquette rules concerning the way of eating. ... Air and light are basic factors for life, and
               it is lamentable that such an important rule of hygiene is not taken care of and practically
               ignored by many people. We care about it strongly. The glowing health that our orphans enjoy
               - thank God - is mostly due to the wide observance of this hygienic rule: air, always plenty of
               fresh new air day and night, in the dormitory, in the workshop, in the school, during recreation,
               in the refectory, everywhere.”
                       He would ask the Assistants and the teachers about the children’s health and always
               required the Superiors to check diligently, saying, “The least of the orphans is more valuable
               than the Founder and the Mother General!”



               3. Among the Children

                       He felt at home among the children. A very simple episode, which goes back to the last
               years of Father Hannibal’s life, has remained engraved in my heart.

                       It happened in the Avignone Houses in Messina. The boys were in the shops; some of
               the smaller ones, exempted from work, for some squabbles among them, gathered whimpering
               around the huge eucalyptus tree that dominated and perfumed the courtyard.  Suddenly, coming
               from outside, the Father arrived. He was wearing his hat over the head and his long cloak was
               waving open adding to the dignity if his noble bearing. The children sprung up shouting, “The
               Father! The Father!” and ran to him happily clapping their hands. The Father smiled, opened
               his cloak and the children hurried under it joyfully.
                       The Father said, “Let us go, let us go! Let us walk this way!” In that manner, as if
               dragging the children under his mantle, he toured the courtyard with measured steps.
                       He had forgotten all his tiredness, worries, and troubles. With the children, he became
               a child again. Not for nothing, he had written:

                       I love my children; they are for me
                       The most cherished ideal of my life.
                       From oblivion and abandonment, I rescued them
                       Deeply prompted by a daring hope.

                       O purest pearls, my little girls,
                       One by one, I picked them up from dirt,

                       Like precious shells thrown along the streets
                       Now on their way to a better future.




                                                           68]]></page><page Index="69"><![CDATA[In the feasts celebrated in the community, the children read short poems for him. At
               times, he also replied in verses keeping the same meter and rhyme of the children. For a girl,
               whose family name was Loiodice, he wrote:


                       If I had flowers-like virtues
                       I would gather the most beautiful of them,
                       And painting them with lovely colors
                       I would offer them to you.
                       I would pass them to you, my daughter,
                       To let you love Jesus with strong affection.
                       Now I pray Jesus that you may be,
                       You yourself, a gift acceptable to Him:

                       A gift that He presses to in his Heart
                       Smiling to you in a gentle act of love.


               4. Correcting and Encouraging

                       His paternity extended with impartiality to all the Institutes. If ever a partiality and
               preference existed, it was for those who suffered more.
                       How skilled he was in encouraging. After a performance, Father Hannibal gave a holy
               picture of Our Lady of Lourdes to a novice endowed with a beautiful voice. He wrote these
               words on the back, “Hurray to the Lord and a special blessing, with the wish that the harmony
               [of your voice] be joined to that of holy virtues because these are the true harmonious song
               before the Lord.”
                       The Father’s corrections were unforgettable. Once I hurriedly crossed the corridor in
               front of his room. He recognized my stride, came to the door, waved me to slow down, and
               with a smile he said, “Don’t you remember what Dante says about haste? That ‘the wholeness
               [of a person] is proclaimed by his actions.’ (Purgatorio III:11). Hurrying takes perfection
               away from things and spoils them. Go ahead... without haste.”
                       One day, from his room, Father Hannibal heard that a boy, quarreling with a companion
               during their games, had shouted: ‘It’s a lie!’
                       The Father came out and asked, “Who said ‘lie’? It is a lack of charity towards a
               companion, supposing in him the intention to deceive. You shall simply say, ‘It’s not like that!’”

                       He also knew how to punish and ...  make the punishment accepted with gladness.
                       Once he punished me to kneel in the refectory, because, while preparing the ciborium
               with the hosts, I filled it too much, and a host fell on the altar.
                       - You have to be punished ...

                       - Gladly, Father.
                       - You will be on your knees in the refectory.
                       When the punishment was over, I went to him to ask for forgiveness. When he saw me,
               he smiled. I knelt and began, “Father, forgive me ...” He did not let me continue and explained,
               “The host was not yet consecrated...  sometimes I give a punishment to see how my sons accept
               it... Go in peace ...”

               the  Superiors.  He  exhorted  the  Superior  General,  Mother  Nazzarena,  “to  write  in  a  mild,
               humble, respectful, and uplifting manner to the brides of Jesus Christ (the Sisters).” Then he
               quoted the words of the Scripture, “The lute and the zither make a beautiful sound, but they are
               not comparable to a gentle tongue.” “With kindness and sweetness, you can say everything
               without offending and embittering people. Remember that the Superior General is the Vicar of
               the Most Holy Virgin Mary and has to imitate Her who was a dove without gall.”



               5. His Religious in the Army

                       Then came World War I... What a bitterness for his fatherly heart! First, he wrote a
               fervent prayer ‘for our confreres in the army’ which had to be recited every day in all the
               Houses.
                       The remembrance of his Religious who were in the army always surfaced in the hymns
               of July 1 of those years.

                       Jesus; where are they roaming
                       The sons of your Rogate?

                       They too are Children of Italy
                       Among risks and perils ...
                       Soldiers of two armies,
                       Of the Italian and ... the heavenly one!

                       Addressing Our Lady:

                       Dear children, your beloved children,
                       Constant champions of the Rogate;

                       Now dispersed among risks and perils,
                       Over lands steaming with blood!
                       Oh, on that most beautiful among the days
                       Bring these dear brothers back to us!

                       Again:

                       O great Mother! If the divine wrath
                       Has also features of kind forgiveness,
                       In the field of so much devastation
                       Save our brothers consecrated to the Lord!

                       Remember that they are the germ
                       Of the Rogate of his divine Heart!

                       Father Hannibal always encouraged his Religious with a good word and material help.

               declared fit for the war! What can I say? I am distressed to the point of tears. However, can
               we mistrust the kind mercy of the Sacred Heart of Jesus? Let it never be!”

                       In  a  circular  letter  to  the  Rogationist  soldiers,  he  wrote,  “I  take  advantage  of  the
               occasion, dearest children, to advise you never to become lax in your spirit about the Divine
               Presence and the religious principles. May the fatigue and discomfort of the military life serve
               you as a very effective means by which the Lord calls you to a closer union with his divine
               Heart.”
                       Again, “These are all God’s ways. When you, dearest children, will return to our dear
               Institute as we firmly hope for the love of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, you will come back as
               grown-up men, to become champions of Jesus Christ and his beloved Evangelical Rogation!
               Meanwhile, the Lord desires that you pass through a series of interior and exterior sacrifices
               of every kind since it was written, ‘what can he know who has never suffered?’”

                       It was his dream, his prayer, that all of them would come back!... He had implored it
               from Our Lady:

                       Oh! Save Italy from shore to shore

                       When it is time, and reverent to You,
                       O Mother, let them come back to their sweet nest,
                       Bring them all back, in your great mercy!

                       Some did not return because they did not want to, and some could not return. Bro.
               Mansueto Drago, one of our dear young students, lost his life on Monte Nero (Karst) on March
               24, 1917. The Father enshrined his memory in the Eucharistic hymn of that year:


                       Compassionate companion
                       Of our exile, now look
                       At the little flock of your Rogate
                       That sighs to you,
                       Adoring your will
                       On our child, Mansueto,
                       Whom you wanted to draw to you.


                       To this, he added the prayer for all the Rogationist soldiers:

                       Look at them, the tender lambs
                       Of your dearest sheepfold
                       From the temple and silence
                       Scattered on hostile fields!
                       They turn to you the cry
                       Of their devastated heart,
                       But steadfast in their faith.

                       The war also had another victim. One of Bro. Mansueto’s cousins, Bro. Mariano Drago,
               a coadjutor, who was a soldier in Palermo, became completely blind in a few days.
                       The Father wrote, “My heart is deeply hurt! Among our dearest children, none was so
               warm in his love for us, especially for me, as the dearest Bro. Mariano. He must have been a
               victim of my sins and the present society’s sins.”
                       Father Hannibal rushed to Palermo and had to struggle to get him discharged from the
               military.
                       He wrote, “I have never been so pierced! The death of a young man in the battlefront
               is not the greatest pain as we thought. To lose your eyesight at the age of twenty-five and live
               like a dead man for another forty or fifty years is much worse. Certainly, we, who by our Lord’s
               grace, are Christians and his ministers, will always praise and bless God’s adorable will, but
               he doesn’t forbid the fatherly love we have for our dear children in Jesus Christ to implore for
               a grace!”
                       He did the impossible for the young man to recover his sight, especially by requesting
               prayers from holy people and monasteries of his acquaintance. In a letter to the Mother Superior
               of Altamura, Sr. Maria Elisabetta, recommending very intense prayers to the Infant Jesus, he
               concluded, “Say so many prayers that He must surrender!” Jesus did not surrender because he
               had his special plans for the pious Brother, but the prayers were certainly effective.
                       In the early days of his problem, when he was still in the hospital of Palermo, the Father
               observed, “The many prayers which are said for him, poor Brother, attract the merciful eye of
               our Lord on him. This evening the Lord gave him such an interior calm that, as I was leaving,
               or rather, when he let me go, I heard a sound as if he was wailing. I did not know what it was.
               I approached him and asked what was the matter. He answered quietly and serenely: ‘I am
                                                   *
               singing: Blood of the First Martyr.’”


               7. The Daughters of Divine Zeal in Padua


                       In 1917, the bishop of Padua requested the Daughters of Divine Zeal for the Belzoni
               Military Hospital. Father Hannibal sent eight of them and followed them with great care for
               the few months that they stayed there. He visited them more than once and encouraged them
               in the mission, which was new to them. “You do not only have the task of comforting our
               afflicted brother soldiers there; you also have the task of letting your religious habit shine and
               be appreciated by the civil and ecclesiastical authorities as well as to prepare the beautiful
                               *
               work of Arcella,  where St. Anthony, the glorious wonder-worker has called us. In order to do
               this, you have to pay attention to your religious duties, beginning with the Morning Prayer that
               is so important. Never neglect any of the religious practices we are used to, according to our
               calendar. All shall obey like little girls the Sister leading you. She represents the Superior
               General, or, if you want, the Divine Superior Herself.  Be very loving with each other.
                       “Great is the task entrusted to you, rather wide and in a new field. You all know,
               however, what our weapons are: prayer, right intention, the spirit of sacrifice, the practice of

               Monastery of Arcella, which about 500 meters from the land Father Hannibal bought and where the Rogationist
               Institute in Padua now stands.

               yourselves nor the others be influenced by the behavior of the sick. Be modest with your eyes,
               keep an appropriate demeanor, inner concentration, and so on. Religious Sisters of active life
               must be like Noah’s dove, which came back to the ark without wetting itself or like the sun’s
               ray which never dims even when it touches the mud.”
                       That year, by the end of October, the breaching of the Italian battlefront at Caporetto
               and the invasion of the Veneto Region [by the Austro-Hungarian Army] happened. Father
               Hannibal instructed the Sisters not to leave, “As long as the hospital is there, remain there as
               the Holy Father has recommended for all the ecclesiastical people.” However, Father Hannibal
               sent right away a telegram to all the Houses, asking for very special prayers for those Sisters.
               Thus, he comforted them, “I myself, never cease unworthily to recommend you to the Sacred
               Heart of Jesus, to the Holy Virgin, to St. Anthony of Padua, that they may protect and enlighten
               you in the cases of doubts when you have no one to advise you... I admire your resignation to
               the divine will and your perfect abandonment in God. This is the best disposition so that the
               Sacred Heart of Jesus may help and assist you in every circumstance. It is unnecessary to
               remind you and to all the perfect observance, the practice of the holy virtues, and the concern
               to never displease in any way the adorable Heart of Jesus that is already quite angry at the
               sinful humankind”.
                       After the withdrawal of Caporetto, the Belzoni Hospital was transferred to Florence,
               where the collaboration of the Daughters of the Divine Zeal was no longer needed, so they
               returned to Trani.



                8. The Spanish Flu

                       The year 1918 saw the outbreak of a great epidemic, the Spanish flu. Father Hannibal
               wrote, “The right, holy and divine hand of the Supreme God is felt everywhere on this mad and
               apostate society! Oh, what a joy it brings, even if we were to perish! Let the time of vengeance
               for the incessant human iniquities come! May the Most High remain vindicated and atoned for
               the universal human transgression! May kings and peoples oppressed under the divine scourge,
               be regenerated. This will be for salvation! Honor and glory only to God! However, these are
               still the beginnings of suffering! Let us abandon ourselves confidently to the adorable Heart of
               Jesus, and offer ourselves as victims of his adorable will.”
                       In  those  days,  the  Father  was  in  Apulia,  going  back  and  forth  between  Trani  and
               Altamura, the Houses most affected. The one encouraging, helping, substituting nurses, and so
               on... was the Father with the heart of a mother.

                                          BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES






               1. He Never Drew Back


                        While the Congregations and the Orphanages kept Father Hannibal constantly busy,
               they did not limit his activity, which extended far and wide beyond his Works. When it came
               to doing good, Father Di Francia never drew back.
                       From  his  early  years,  the  Father  nourished  a  particular  devotion  to  St.  Veronica
               Giuliani. Though he could not preach a Novena in Città di Castello, he contributed to the glory
               of St. Veronica by revealing to the world her admirable writings and publishing “The Hidden
               Treasure”, which had remained buried in the Capuchins’ archives for over a century and a half.
               Unfortunately, he had to stop the publication at the second volume due to illness and other
               commitments!
                       Due to Father Hannibal’s zeal and piety, the precious relic of the heart of St. Camillus
               was kept in Messina, which otherwise would have been transferred to Palermo.
                       On November 16, 1894, a strong earthquake shook Messina and it seemed a miracle
                                                                                    *
               that the city remained standing. The people felt a beneficial response.   Those were days of
               great  toils  for  Father  Hannibal  and  his  brother.  The  crowds  flocked  to  the  Avignone
               neighborhood, longing for a word of trust and reconciliation with God. From there they moved
               almost in procession towards the Archbishop’s palace and Cardinal Guarino appeared on the
               balcony to bless the crowd with a large gesture of the left hand since his right was already
               paralyzed.


                       2. We Must Preach Jesus Crucified


                       Father Hannibal’s intense work in the field of sacred preaching deserves wider mention.
                       First, we have to know his mind about this. We can see it from the Father’s report about
               a speech given by Canon Ardoino for the closing of the year 1877, and published in “The
               Catholic Word” on January 2, 1878.
                       The preaching of Canon Ardoino “was done with the utmost clarity and acclaim; a
               clarity, however, that did not dim the thought and the acclaim that did not degrade the sublimity
               of the Christian teachings. Indeed, the simpler the truth, the clearer and nobler it is. The quotes
               from the Bible and the Fathers of the Church, so indispensable for the Christian oratory,
               corroborated his arguments. His way of presenting was serious, certain, and dignified; he was
               a person who was completely imbued with the truth of his topic. Some brief inaccuracies of

               handling of oratory forms.
                       “In some areas, the genius of the Christian eloquence flashed. We observed with great
               satisfaction that the people hung on the lips of the speaker and gave signs of regret, rather than
               vain and useless admiration. We will not add anything else. We really said a bit too much for
               the modesty of the Rev. Canon Ardoino, but we would rather take the liberty to express frankly
               our mind about the state of preaching in Messina. We hope that many will persuade themselves
               to  what  consists  of  the  true  value  of  the  herald  of  the  Divine  Word.  Away  with  the  vain
               ostentation of intricate scholastic and nebulous philosophy. A well explained Gospel parable
               is worth more than all the pompous declamations. The depository of Christian morals is a great
               sea, from which one can always draw with success and perhaps with less effort.
                       “It is the proclamation of God’s Word, as the Prophet says, that enlightens and gives
               understanding to the children. Is it not perhaps with the practical presentation of this morality
               that  Massillons,  Bourdaloue,  and  Bossuet  in  France,  and  Segneri,  Torniello,  Venini,  and
               Ventura, and many others in Italy ascended to high levels of Christian eloquence? Is it not by
               explaining the Gospel and correcting the people’s habits that Tertullian, St. Augustine, St.
               Basil, and St. John Chrysostom, through the eternal miracle of Christian oratory, touched the
               summit of eloquence? Let us always keep these models in our hands. Let us draw from the
               Bible, from the Fathers, from the Gospel, and from the sound theological doctrine. Let us
               organize the material we have to present. Let us study the art of properly adorning it and
               making  it  acceptable.  Let  us  deal  with  the  ministry  of  the  Divine  Word  with  the  purity  of
               intention, with sincerity of heart, with order, clarity, relevance, sparing in embellishment, then
               we will obtain the profit of souls!
                       “Let  us  always  remember  that  we  must  preach  Jesus  Christ  Crucified  and  not
               ourselves.”


               3. His Eloquence

                       The Lord had given Father Hannibal an easy, lively, and fascinating eloquence; a sharp
               voice,  though  not  very  strong,  which  pierces  the  audience  like  a  blade;  and  a  measured,
               expressive gesturing, and the fire of the heart ... His sermons were remembered for a long time.
                       Though he could not dedicate himself completely to preaching, he would gladly take
               advantage of every opportunity to pour out his soul through words.
                       However, in his self-eulogy, he judges his eloquence this way: “When he became a
               Priest he dedicated himself to preaching and, almost immediately, to this Pious Work.  His
               preaching had ups and downs. Sometimes his sermons were vibrant, sometimes miserable! He
               used to say that two phenomena happened during his sermons: some people yawned while
               others cried.”

                       Yet, the judgment of his listeners was different. Canon Celona recalled, “His interior
               life  had  the  opportunity  to  be  manifested  externally  through  his  preaching,  which  flowed
               spontaneously and eloquently from his heart; people listened to it with immense pleasure and
               produced abundant fruit.” He had his own distinct way of speaking. In Brà (in the Province of
               Cuneo), once Don Orione asked Father Hannibal to say a few words to the novices and priests
               of his Congregation. Don Risi, who was present, confessed, “For me, it was a fascination, for
               what he said and the way he said it.”
                       Parish  priests  and  rectors  of  churches,  especially  during  the  early  years  of  his
               priesthood, were vying for him; and he could not deny them.

               he never improvised, no matter who the audience was, even if they were only a few boys or
               very modest Religious Sisters, despite his natural ease and long practice of speaking.



               4. In Special Occasions

                       Father  Hannibal  left  us  voluminous  notes  of  sermons,  instructions,  panegyrics,
               discussions,  etc.  He  always  wrote  down  an  outline,  or  rather  a  fairly  developed  draft  and
               sometimes he wrote out the entire speech, though only a few. Among them, we recall the
               panegyrics on Our Lady of the ‘Lettera’ and of the ‘Racomandati’, on St. Ignatius, St. Clare,
               St. Mark, St. Aloysius, St. Euplius, St. Cyrus, and Blessed Eustochio. Understandably, he wrote
               down sermons in full for special occasions so that he could read them. We also mention some
               funeral eulogies, which became memorable, because on great events, Messina wanted to hear
               Father Hannibal’s word.
                       In 1885, Canon Ardoino, a distinguished scholar of moral theology, whose fame had
               filled Sicily, died. In the funeral eulogy, Father Hannibal raised a hymn to the priesthood as
               the light of peoples with the double beam of science and holiness. Naturally, the memories of
               his  young  years  emerged,  “Tender  and  sad  remembrances!  It  seems  to  me  to  see  Canon
               Ardoino, when, calm and serene, during the classes in our Seminary, as a good master among
               his  pupils,  he  explained  the  cumbersome  moral  questions  and  made  more  intelligible  the
               scholarly pages of Scavini... to us young students. He was always joyful, lovable, patient! The
               following years found him always in the same place. The classes changed, clerics succeeded
               clerics, new students attended the classes, but he was always at his place, indefatigable to teach
               and cultivate the blossoms of the Sanctuary! Alas! A new generation of clerics will enter that
               class tomorrow, but the ancient Master will not be there anymore to teach them!”
                       For the death of the Archbishop, Cardinal Guarino, in such a magnificent re-enactment,
               Father Hannibal remembers him as “A father who quivers with tenderness and love for his
               sons; a Shepherd who pours out himself for his sheep; and a Prince who saintly reigns and
               governs in the midst of his people.”
                       The funeral eulogy for Leo XIII was splendid.
                       Since the temporal power of the Popes had ended, the sectarian liberalism foresaw and
               announced the end of the Church with the death of Pius IX. However, the Divine Providence
               raised Leo XIII, “the prophetic light in the sky” (lumen in caelo), who in his twenty-five years
               of pontificate, cast his rays all over the world. “He magnificently increased the brightness and
               splendor of the Holy Church; he expanded the kingdom of God in the world, brought Christ
               back in front of the earthly realms, and showed Him as He is in Catholicism: the God of peace,
               love, and truth; the God of eternal life.” He made the moral power of the Papacy shine forth
               with vivid light that has no need for material weapons to triumph over a convulsed, restless,
               and unrestrained century. “He donned the strongest spiritual weapons. He put on the armor of
               fortitude and constancy; he grasped the shield of evangelical doctrine and of the sanctity of his
               rights; he adjusted the helmet of the great concepts of the Catholic faith; he brandished the
               two-edged sword of the Divine Word. Then, entrusting himself to a great, invincible leader,
               that is the spirit of true prudence and of Christian meekness, he entered the struggle and won”.
                       The memory of Leo XIII inevitably linked to his social action.
                       Father Hannibal wrote, “What a vast field opens before me; how can I travel it all in
               such a short time? Should I talk about the great importance of this social problem? Of the
               arguments that the miseries of the working class offer socialism to put forward its theories, and



                                                           76]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[proclaim itself as the expected messiah of peoples? But I keep silent because it seems to me to
               see that diaphanous and trembling hand of the Vicar of Christ as if from his coffin he would
               place his hand over his heart to tell me, ‘Here (in my heart) I brought the weary workers!’”

                       Then Father Hannibal mentions Leo XIII’s Encyclical letters: Rerum Novarum (1891)
               and On the Christian Democracy (1901).



               5. Commemorating Ludwig Windthorst

                       We cannot neglect a page of Father Hannibal’s life that has a particular connection with
               the present times, especially what concerns the apostolate of the laity: the commemoration of
               Ludwig  Windthorst  (1812-1891),  an  eminent  champion  of  Catholicism  in  Germany  who
               fiercely stood against Bismarck and forced him to surrender.
                       “Windthorst  was  the  man  stirred  by  the  Divine  Providence...  Among  the  many
               persecutions which targeted the Church of Jesus Christ in our day, the one that came from the
               most powerful nation in the world, Germany, is not to be considered the last. The inadequate
               laws already manifested the persecution, while at the head of the Germany of Luther, the most
               intelligent  politician  of  our  times,  Otto  von  Bismarck,  was  the  arbiter  of  the  destinies  of
                                                                                                       *
               peoples. He almost issued a challenge to the Papacy by saying: We will not go to Canossa!
                       However, there was a man who took up the gauntlet and went down into the field to
               compete with the feared Prussian. This man was Windthorst!
                       What he did to overthrow the head of the German parliament cannot be explained by
               simply stating the facts. Nevertheless, with the eye of faith, we have to admire the grace of the
               Lord, which penetrates the hearts, invests the minds, ignites, arouses, moves, agitates, inspires,
               and fills with a sacred fury, as the biblical expression rightly tells: ‘I was filled with sacred
               fury’ because the God who forms the saints also forms the geniuses. He is the one who creates
               devotion and courage, compassion, and fortitude, the ecstasy of love, and the ardor of struggle!
               He does everything to everybody, as the Apostle says. Thus, while the clouds saturated with
               horrible storm thickening on the cold north to pour down on the mystical little boat of Peter,
               suddenly a breath of wind scatters them. They flee, disappear, the storm dissolves, serenity
               returns, and the fierce opponent of Catholicism withdraws his gauntlet, tears his unjust laws,
               and turns reverent and humiliated to the venerable Old Man of the Vatican.
                       The Providence obtained its intent: Windthorst, the providential man, accomplished his
               mission!”
                       Father Hannibal then speaks of the efforts and battles sustained by Windthorst to arrive
               at the triumph of his Christian ideal, “He saw with his own eyes all the enemy camps. A majority
               had to be created; the Catholics had to unite into one and oppose their energy and will to the
               unbridled progress of the adversaries of the Catholic religion. First, it was necessary that this
               core,  this  center  of  lively,  active,  and  combative  Catholicism,  be  true  Catholicism,  be  the
               constituted, organized, and compact Catholic laity whose principles were purely Catholic. The
               greater difficulty of our time is that many call themselves Catholic, but few are those who
               openly profess in their entirety the principles of Catholicism! Windthorst went beyond his time
               and difficulties. He was a man of mind and heart but also a man of action and eloquence. He
               gathered  around  him  the  Catholic  members  of  the  German  parliament,  formed  a  great


               *  TN. Canossa is a municipality and castle town in the Province of Reggio Emilia, northern Italy. It is the site
               where Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV did penance in 1077, standing three days bare-headed in the snow, in order
               to reverse his excommunication by Pope Gregory VII. The Walk to Canossa is sometimes used as a symbol of the
               changing relationship between the medieval Church and State.

               In this way, he was able to impose himself on the adversaries of the Church and repress their
               bold impudence!”

                       Father Hannibal then expounds on the consequences derived from the example of the
               great  Windthorst,  for  the  Christians  of  his  time  and  ours.  “What  is  then  the  duty  of  the
               Catholics? What are the sentiments that we have to awaken in us in front of the venerable coffin
               of such a generous son of the Church? Our duty is nothing else but to foster evermore, with all
               our strength, the honor of the mystical sanctuary of God, the Catholic Church. We have to
               proceed in this sacred task with that integrity of conscience, purity of principles, firmness of
               purpose, and freedom of spirit and speech with which the great Windthorst fulfilled his noble
               career as a distinguished defender of the right cause.”
                       Then, turning to the young promoters of that commemoration, Father Hannibal urged
               them, “This model is offered first to you, the youth, that you may learn to love the Church, to
               honor its holy laws and the Catholic devotion, which the world calls bigotry, while they form
               the great men who earn universal admiration.
                       “There is a glory based on the vanity of foolish human evaluation. However, it soon
               lapses and dims before the impartial judgment of history and in the face of the serene and
               unbiased conscience of the new people. Then, there is the true glory, which passes through
               time, because it is a reflection of the eternal glory; the glory of those who can say in the midst
               of human vicissitudes and earthly defeats, ‘I have loved justice and hated iniquity!’ Let us leave
               its nonsense to the world and let us rejoice in being children of the Church and in aspiring to
               the true glory.
                       “If we let the Kingdom of God on earth be our whole ambition, we cannot but be
               victorious. The heavens harmonize and the heavenly creatures echo us. God is with us! Let us
               be brave, without letting ourselves be intimidated by human respect. Let us not be ashamed to
               call ourselves Catholics, because Jesus Christ said, if you do not acknowledge me before men,
               neither will I acknowledge you before my Father. Let us manifest our religion in our works and
               first in the purity of our principles. Let half-baked Catholicism be far from us, which accepts
               all the articles of the Law but always with some reservation; which respects the Vicar of Jesus
               Christ but with certain conditions, and which compromises with the opponents of the Church.
               In short, let us stay away  from Catholicism that is not pure and integral, mixed with the false
               maxims of the world, whereby some, while calling themselves sons of the Church, do not shun
               from becoming earnest admirers and supporters of the enemies of the Church!”
                       He concludes, “Be united, young people, in the sole intent of defending the holy cause,
               because strength is in unity! ... Such are, gentlemen, the feelings that the memory of that great
               Ludwig Windthorst, must awaken in us as a true model of the Catholic laity,”



               6. The ‘Geltrudine’ of the Sacred Heart

                       In  1910,  Father  Hannibal  became  acquainted  with  an  Institute  consecrated  to  St.
               Geltrude,  founded  in  Naples  by  a  Benedictine  Oblate,  Lady  Geltrude  Gomez  d’Anza,  and
               assisted  by  Fr.  Angelo  Padovano.  An  orphanage  was  later  added  to  the  initial  workshop
               intended to assist young working women. The work was sailing amidst innumerable difficulties
               and needed help.
                       Father Di Francia, as usual, did not spare himself and worked through the press to make
               the new Institution known, calling the attention especially of the Neapolitans to it. For two

               for the formation of the ‘Geltrudine of the Heart of Jesus’.
                       In one of his papers, Fr. Padovano attributes to Father Hannibal the title of Co-founder,
               and this makes us believe that he did much to help that Work, which today, thank God, is
               flourishing.



               7. The Daughters of Sacro Costato

                       The Daughters of Sacro Costato (Sacred Side), required a greater commitment. The
               very  devout  Fr.  Eustachio  Montemurro,  helped  by  Fr.  Saverio  Valerio,  with  the  valid
               collaboration of the Jesuit Fr. Gennaro Bracale, had founded them in Gravina di Puglia (Bari)
               in 1908. However, just a few years later, in 1911, under the accusation of engaging in pseudo-
               mysticism, the competent ecclesiastical authorities dismissed the founders and suppressed the
               foundation.

                       The Bishops of the dioceses in which the Daughters of the Sacro Costato were zealously
               exercising their apostolate, obtained from St. Pius X permission to try to save the Institute by
               giving it a new direction. Thus, they placed the almost devastated Work in the hands of Father
               Di Francia, to infuse new life and vigor into it. Father Hannibal worked at this with so much
               diligence and love that later he wrote “I have looked after the Daughters of Sacro Costato as
               one of my foundations and I have consumed myself to help and carry them forward.”
                       First, he renewed their spirit, giving them a regulation suited to their condition. In
               presenting it to the communities, he wrote, “Consider well that you will have a great need to
               observe it because you must consider yourselves as a community that was struck and dissolved
               by the Holy Church... Why? Humility requires that you believe that you have received this
               tremendous  blow  for  your  sins  and  neglect.  Therefore,  with  a  great  spirit  of  humility,
               compunction, and contrition you have to welcome these rules, and accept them as a means that
               the compassionate Lord offers you for your spiritual resurrection. Do not neglect this means
               of salvation. Consider that from the perfect observance of these rules you could obtain the
               greatest advantages. You will be a holy community attracting other souls to this holy vocation,
               your Houses will always progress, new Houses will open, the good of souls in the Holy Church
               will multiply... and the Divine Mercy will give you more than you have lost.”
                       The Institution not only recovered but also began to prosper happily. In 1919, because
               of a disagreement with Mons. Razzoli, Bishop of Potenza, Mons. Farina was sent as Apostolic
               Visitor. This sanctioned the split of the Daughters of Sacro Costato into two branches: the
               Catechist Missionaries of the Heart of Jesus, under the Bishop of Potenza, and the Missionary
               Sisters  of  the  Sacro  Costato  who  remained  loyal  to  Father  Hannibal,  and  after  his  death
               affiliated themselves to the Society of Jesus.
                       Both Congregations are now of pontifical right and, with God’s help, are doing much
               good in the holy Church.

                                        THE BREAD OF ST. ANTHONY





               1. Financial Difficulties

                       For over twenty years, the financial difficulties were the heaviest among the many
               worries  of  Father  Hannibal’s  works.  They  were  tribulations  that  he  overcame  by  blindly
               entrusting himself to the Divine Providence.
                       In 1901 he wrote, “From the point of view of its means of survival, this Work could only
               last one day, that is, today, and for tomorrow there is nothing. Still, we do not worry much
               about this, as it seems to us that what is important for our Work is to take care of the Divine
               Glory and of the good of souls, with the right intention - which is pure grace from God. Works
               are not created with gold or silver, but by laying their bases on the purest principles of fear of
               God and the holy Christian virtues. About this, yes, we often worry, to the point of being several
               times on the edge of giving up...
                       “On the other hand, that Divine Providence, which feeds the birds of the air and clothes
               the lilies of the fields, has never let us down, and has often helped us in a very admirable way!”
                       During the time of Father Hannibal, the laws and benefits inspired by social justice,
               which are the achievements of our days, did not exist then. The orphan, who did not have family
               properties remained abandoned, and those who engaged in works of beneficence, could only
               count on private charity. Usually, the priest’s cassock was not welcomed, especially by public
               administrators.


               2. I am a Priest...

                       Having applied for a subsidy of 3,000 Lire from the Municipality of Messina for the
               festivities of mid-August 1902, Father Hannibal had to withstand, together with the denial of
               the  contribution,  a  series  of  insults  in  the  Council  Hall,  which  stirred  in  him  an  energetic
               reaction.

                       The Father bravely wrote, “The gentlemen Counselors opposing me are making it a
               matter of their party and principles to pretend that for 3,000 Lire I sell my principles and
               accept theirs. However, if they are unbelievers, rationalists, atheists, and enemies of the priests,
               I am a priest, I am a cleric, I am a Roman Catholic, apostolic, and I am faithful to my priestly
               uniform. I am proud of my religious principles, which have sustained and will sustain me in
               the tremendous fight for the salvation of so many unfortunate little creatures, who, with all the
               rants and the insults of my opponents, would now be either in prison or in prostitution houses.
               I am aware that my educational system aims at forming honest, hardworking, and civil young
               people.
                       “I remain unconcerned about the denial of the annual 3,000 Lire subsidy, as I always
               confided in that highest Providence who feeds the little birds of the air with the worm under
               the stone! I had mixed feelings of horror and pity, when I realized that today’s society was
               sliding down the slope.”

                       Father Hannibal’s modest family properties soon vanished like smoke as the needs
               multiplied day by day, as the people assisted by him were like a circle far too wide for his
               charity.
                       All the needy went to him and never went away unsatisfied. He would give without
               counting the cost and without reservation, giving always to everyone. The less he felt he had,
               the more generous he was in giving, convinced that this was the very secret to attract the Divine
               delights and to force the Divine Providence to greater generosity. In Messina, they used to say,
               “This is the House of Father Francia, whoever comes, can sit and eat.”
                       Father Hannibal left written for his followers, “The Rogationists must remember that
               our pious Work was born with this holy mission of giving and that the more we give, the more
               the Lord will give us. In fact, He said: ‘Give one, and you will receive a hundred, and you will
               possess  eternal  life.’”  Elsewhere  he  added,  “There  is  more  happiness  in  giving  than  in
               receiving.”
                       What  a  pleasant  sight  to  see  him  sitting  among  the  poor!  Eating  with  them,  after
               scraping together from them, on his knees, some of their food, all for the love of God, talking
               affably to them, catechizing them, distributing alms while his face radiated with joy! He would
               get the money from a metal little pot, smiling and saying, “Inside this pot, money boils and
               multiplies for the poor...”


               4. An Unpleasant Accusation

                       The supernatural principles were the constant rule of his life and enlightened all his
               charitable activities. Naturally, opponents were never lacking, but he did not care, though on
               one occasion he wanted also to justify himself.
                       He wrote, “They accuse me of helping the poor. This accusation truly displeases me.
               Helping the poor, the afflicted, the miserable, the abandoned that are dying from hunger and
               cold, and the blind and the crippled who are unable to work, is the duty of every Christian,
               even if it requires some effort. Jesus Christ our Lord told us to do to others what we would like
               them to do to us.
                       “They say, ‘You do not have the means to help the poor because you have to take care
               of the orphans.’
                       “I never took anything away from my orphans to assist the poor. I obtained the means
               for my orphans from public generosity and I experienced that the Divine Providence, to whom
               the poor is worth as much as the rich, never left me without the means to give some soup and
               a piece of bread to the needy.”
                       “They say, ‘You are helping beggars who could work.’
                       “I beg you, gentlemen, to come one day to my Institute at noontime, and you will see
                                    *
               the pool of Bethesda.  You will see feeble old men, blind, crippled people languishing from
               hunger. I can assure you that I lifted some of them who fainted from hunger. If then among
               those there are some who are jobless, isn’t it true that even among those without an occupation
               there are some who cannot find a job in their trade, even though they are willing to work?

               *
                 EN. The term probatica piscina was used in the Italian original. The reference is the healing pool in John 5:2.
                                                           81]]></page><page Index="82"><![CDATA[Should society sentence them to death? But charity and humanity do not dare to do it, to deny
               the charity of a piece of bread.”
                       “They say, ‘We know that some of the poor are deceiving you and stealing from you.’
                       “It may happen that under false appearances of extreme poverty a rascal may conceal
               himself and rob me of a plate of soup and of a morsel of bread (truly a very grave crime!)
               However, I cannot adopt the saying ‘so that the culprit may not escape, let the just man perish’.
               I mean, for the fear of giving bread to a false beggar, I cannot deny it to so many truly unhappy
               people!
                       “Do they steal from me? Please, gentlemen, didn’t anyone steal from you? Didn’t it
               ever happen that human fraud and falsification took money away from your pockets and safe
               boxes,  in  spite  of  your  vigilance  and  attention?  Maybe  I  am  touching  a  painful  spot  or
               awakening painful experiences!
                       “I beg you, therefore, not to criticize me so light-heartedly if, while I distribute help to
               so many unhappy people, among the throng there happens to infiltrate a beggar, who at the
               end, is twice unhappy! Yes! Society did not take care of him when he was a young rascal, a
               little beggar; he was left to himself and he gave himself to a bad life. Today, will society
               sentence him to death? At least may he find, in the heavenly breath of charity, a feeling of
               peace, which could bring him back to better thoughts.”


               5. Debts and Creditors


                       With Father Hannibal’s great generosity of heart and of hand, it was natural for debts
               to  pile  up,  with  consequent  serious  troubles.  The  pressing  and  continuous  requests  of  the
               creditors sometimes went at as far as insults, abuses, and threats.
                       Prof. Gazzarra witnessed one day a disgusting scene, which could have ended tragically
               but fortunately had a happy conclusion. A creditor presented himself at the door, firmly decided
               either to be paid or to do something insane... Father Hannibal, calmly tried to soothe him, but
               he ranted even more. Providence intervened at the right moment. Just then an envelope from
               an anonymous donor arrived, which made up for the debt, with a substantial amount left for
               the needs of the House.
                       Another time, Mr. Presente, tired of waiting for the payment of the bread he supplied
               to the orphans, had a warrant issued against Father Hannibal. In the court, the judge asked
               Father Hannibal if he had a lawyer. He got from his pocket an image of St. Joseph and said,
               “This is my lawyer. I recognize my debt and I want to pay, and I will do it certainly as soon as
               the Providence will send me the money.”
                       At this point, Mr. Presente came forward to object, “Always these words, confidence
               in St. Joseph: I have to pay, I shall pay, let’s wait for Providence. Anyway, let us wait again
               and for today we don’t talk anymore...” Thus, the court hearing ended.


               6. The Providence Always Intervened


                       Indeed,  if  the  Divine  Providence  placed  its  faithful  servant,  Father  Hannibal,  in
               difficulties to let him practice his faith and increase his merits, it never failed to timely intervene
               in mysterious ways. When all seemed lost, at the last moment, an unexpected resource would
               change the situation! It did not happen just once that at lunch or suppertime there was nothing
               on the table, then Father Hannibal gathered his children around him, set them at prayer, or more

                                                           82]]></page><page Index="83"><![CDATA[often led them in front of the Tabernacle or of the statue of Our Lady, and the Providence
               arrived without fail.
                       An episode of evangelical flavor.
                       In one of the frequent days of a low ebb, the orphans went to the refectory while the
               tables were still empty. Father Hannibal entered, “Children, let us pray, and the Lord, will not
               leave us without the necessary.” As soon as the prayer ended, a big tuna fish was brought to
               the door, together with a large basket of bread, which provided abundantly for the meal. The
               tuna  had  been  exceptionally  caught  that  very  morning  in  the  waters  of  Milazzo,  and  an
               unknown benefactor thought that it could serve well for the little orphans.
                       On another occasion, the Sisters complained that there were no more underclothes for
               the girls. The Father said, “Let them ask Our Lady.” The girls prayed and Our Lady listened to
               them. Unexpectedly a cart full of clothes, sent by a generous woman came to the door. There
               were bed sheets, shirts, tissues, plus a steel bed, and four mattresses. While the people in the
               House  were  busy  in  settling  all  those  providential  items,  another  gift,  a  good  quantity  of
               noodles, arrived from God’s grace, sent by an unknown person.
                       One evening, the young men assigned to the kitchen went to the Father to say that in
               the House there was not even a drop of oil to dress the salad. The Father said, “Did you check
               well?”
                       “Very well, and the jar is totally empty.”
                       “Then go back and look harder.” They went back to the pantry. Their eyes were wide
               open, as the jar was filled to the brim with oil. In the meantime, the Father with hands joined
               raised his eyes to heaven in a gesture of prayer. The boys came back happy, “Father, we have
               oil! We have enough...!
                       Another time, the Father was asked urgently for 78 Lire for some immediate needs of
               the House. The Father was with Fr. Vitale and Canon Celona. Only Fr. Vitale, checking his
               pockets, could find a few pennies, 2 Lire in all.
                       “Let the children go to the church,” ordered Father Hannibal. He put on the surplice
               and the stole, opened the tabernacle, and began to recite the Our Father. At the end of the
               prayers, the door-bell rang. It was the postman, with an urgent registered mail.
                       While Father Hannibal had the envelope in his hands, he asked the 2 Lire from Fr.
               Vitale to give to the postman as a tip. The latter protested. He objected because it was too much,
               especially  for  Father  Di  Francia  who  had  so  many  children  to  care  for.  However,  Father
               Hannibal was generous. He insisted and the postman had to accept it.
                       The package was opened. A pair of golden earrings and an envelope, with a note which
               specified that the earrings should be attached to the statue of St. Anthony, while the money in
               the envelope - there were four golden coins worth 20 Lire each - would serve for the needs of
               the orphans. So St. Anthony had sent the needed 78 Lire plus the tip for the postman!
                       We have to add immediately that the final solution to the financial problems of Father
               Hannibal’s Work was taken over by the glorious St. Anthony of Padua.


               7. The First Acquaintance with St. Anthony

                       St. Anthony did not enjoy a special devotion in the Di Francia family. After St. Joseph,
               came St. Francis di Paola. Father Hannibal’s father and brother were named after him. Once
               upon a time, the authentic citizens of Messina used to call St. Francis of Paola ‘The Holy

               after crossing the straits in his tattered mantle.
                       I do not remember if it was in the beginnings of his life as a cleric or as a priest, when
               the Father lost a silver buckle of his shoe, the necessary complement of the priest’s attire in
               those times, at least in Southern Italy. They advised him to pray to St. Anthony to find it. He
               addressed prayers to the Saint for some days, but the buckle was nowhere to be found. Finally,
               he decided to buy a new buckle, so he went to the jeweler who said right away, “Here is your
               buckle; it was found in the street and brought to me, in case its owner might show up!”
                       Thus, St. Anthony and Father Hannibal made their first acquaintance! Afterward, St.
               Anthony became the special patron of the Father’s Work.



               8. The 1887 Cholera Epidemic

                       In September-October 1887, an outbreak of cholera created havoc in Messina. Among
               the orphans of Father Di Francia, there was only one victim, Sarino, a small, intelligent, five-
               year-old angel, who knew his prayers well and repeated them during his sickness. He died
               reciting the Hail Mary.
                       Among the girls, Rosa di Blasi, 11, fell into a coma but recovered and overcame the
               crisis after Father Hannibal administered the Anointing of the Sick to her.
                       Father Hannibal himself could have been a victim, as he contracted the illness but
               recovered quickly without consequences. However, an old lady who had offered her life for
               him got sick with cholera and died.

                       It was on that occasion that the devotion to St. Anthony’s bread for the orphans of
               Father Di Francia was born. Mrs. Susanna Consiglio Miceli, a widow, while the epidemic was
               raging, made the promise that if St. Anthony would save her and her relatives, she would offer
               60 Lire to the orphans of Father Di Francia to buy bread for them in honor of St. Anthony.
                       Mrs. Susanna obtained the grace and kept her promise, sending her offering through
               her house helper, the young Letterio Currò. She began renewing her offering whenever she
               needed a special grace, and St. Anthony never failed to grant it to her because of the prayers of
               the little orphans.
                       The devotion to St. Anthony’s bread for the poor, developed in Toulon (France) by
               Theresa Bouffier, began in 1890, three years after it started in Messina.


               9. The Anthonian Orphanages

                       Father Hannibal placed his orphans under the protection of St. Anthony and named
               them  “Anthonian  Little  Orphans”  (Orfanelli  Antoniani)  and  his  charitable  Institutions
                                         10
               “Anthonian Orphanages.”  On the wall of the small chapel, he placed a modest image of St.

                  10
                     There is no documentation at all of the alleged dialogue of Father Hannibal with the Servant of God Fr.
               Gioacchino  La  Lomìa,  Capuchin  (1831-1905).  According  to  Fr.  Da  Porretta  (Cf.  Popular  Life  of  the  Canon
               Hannibal M. Di Francia, p. 50) it should have happened in the Church of the Holy Spirit and it should have given
               origin to the devotion to St. Anthony in the Works of Father Hannibal. The visit to Avignone indeed took place
               in the early years immediately after Fr. La Lomìa’s return from missions (1880), when the Father’s Works were
               in their beginnings, but nothing was involved concerning the Church of the Holy Spirit nor of the devotion to St.
               Anthony. Speaking of Father Gioacchino, Father Hannibal used to praise his virtues, especially the simplicity with
               which he narrated prodigious facts that the Lord had done through him, but he never had any reference to regarding

               devotion to St. Anthony thus began. Later, it will have a very great development in the majestic
               Temple of the Evangelical Rogation and Shrine of St. Anthony.

                       Father Hannibal and his collaborators started the [Anthonian] promotion in the churches
               of the various dioceses of Sicily through small collection boxes for the Bread of St. Anthony
               for the Little Orphans of Canon Di Francia. There was a frame on the boxes explaining the
               purpose of the Institute and the nature of the devotion, which aimed at the renewal of morals
               and the development of Christian life, thus not limiting itself to obtaining material favors from
               the Saint.
                       Father Hannibal wrote, “The aim of those who expect graces from St. Anthony of Padua
               must be the true spiritual good for themselves and their relatives, oriented to eternal life,
               otherwise any devotion will degenerate into superstition.” “This devotion has to be understood
               in a Catholic sense, and not as superstition and simony. That is, the graces of St. Anthony
               cannot be bought by money but are obtained through faith and charity; a pure and right faith
               in God and in His saints, as well as charity towards the orphans and the poor out of love for
               Jesus and St. Anthony.”
                       Later  the  Father  published  ‘The  Miraculous  Secret’,  a  pamphlet  whose  editions
               multiplied year after year. In 1908, Father Hannibal started “God and Neighbor”, a monthly
               magazine of a rather modest appearance and with a circulation that in a few years exceeded the
               700,000 copies, propagated the name of Fr. Di. Francia and of his Institutes throughout the five
               continents.
                       ‘God and Neighbor’, as the periodical of the orphanages continued until 1942. After
               World War II each orphanage created its own publication of the ‘Herald of St. Anthony’.

                                               “FAITH AND POETRY”



               1. A Little Bit of Parnassus’ Inspiration

                       In 1921, the Printing Press of the Male Orphanage in Oria printed a book collecting a
               good number of Father Hannibal’s poems. The title was “Faith and Poetry”.
                       In previous pages, we hinted about the Father’s poetic talent.
                       Father Hannibal breathed poetry in his family. He wrote, “When I was nine, I started
               scribbling verses. My father, whom I did not know because he died when I was two years old,
               was  a  good  poet,  interested  in  our  most  renowned  poets.  He  wrote  and  published  poems
               according to their classical style. My mother also had a taste for poetry. That is why my two
               brothers and I had a touch of the Parnassus’ inspiration.”
                       He sharpened and brought to proper form this natural talent in the school of Felice
               Bisazza  who  enjoyed  in  those  days  the  wide  fame  as  an  easy  and  elegant  poet,  although
               pretentious literary critics downplay his legacy today.
                       According to Father Di Francia however, Bisazza, as a poet can “be put side by side
               with the greatest geniuses of the modern poetry.” Modern, not contemporary, he frankly notes,
               because the latter brought us libertinism also in poetry! “Freedom of everything! Freedom of
               religion, worship, press, thought, and writing verses. Why do we have to depend on syllables,
               accents, rhyme, and imitative harmony? It would be slavery for free-thinking!” Thus, according
               to the canons of contemporary poetry, Father Hannibal cannot be considered a poet.


               2. I Wrote... as I Felt a Poetic Inspiration


                       The Father had the same concept of poetry as Bisazza, but he had no intention of being
               compared to him. “I know my limitation. I almost feel belittled and disappear in calling to mind
               the many ancient and modern poets who are so plentiful in our Italy, the land of flowers, songs,
               poetry, the enchantment of nature, and smiles of God’s creation.”
                       He remarks, “I wrote many poetic compositions when I was very young because I felt
               the  poetic  inspiration,  and  still  more,  that  intimate  and  indefinite  sentiment  for  what  is
               beautiful, pure and kind love for all that is good and holy. It happens that what we feel with a
               little bit of poetry, we love to externalize in those poetic forms what reflects the internal feeling.
                       “However, I was so far from considering myself a real poet and a person of letters that
               I abandoned and scattered almost all my poems. My humble dedication to charitable Works
               for the abandoned orphans and the poor left me almost no time for literary study.”
                       Certainly, by nature, he had a noble, delicate, very sensitive, and affectionate heart; an
               excitable and creative fantasy, an intimate, gentle sentiment, spontaneity, and taste for beauty
               and rhythm. He mastered his verses. They flowed from him clearly and in a very easy manner,
               enriched with special and charming images. What more do we want from a poet?
                       His book, “Faith and Poetry”, was printed not because the author wanted it. Father
               Hannibal reveals its origin this way, “Some years ago, the clever young people of my Institute
               researched diligently my humble writings. After gathering them, they asked me for permission



                                                           86]]></page><page Index="87"><![CDATA[to print them. I could not deny because of the affection with which they had undertaken such a
               poetic task.”


               3. His Plan

                       In 1869, the Father published a booklet, “First poems of Hannibal Di Francia from
               Messina”. The conclusion of its preface is a program that enlightened his poetic work, “The
               grandeur of his homeland and the glories of his God will be the poet’s rhythms!”
                       To sing ‘the glories of his God!” This is the synthesis of Father Di Francia’s poetic
               work, and the program he faithfully kept throughout his life. God is always the theme of his
               songs: God in the Blessed Sacrament, God in his most Holy Mother, God in his Saints, God in
               his Church.
                       Obviously, not all poems have the same value. Poetic impetus, distinctly chosen form,
               deep thoughts, and genial concepts could not accompany him in all the poems, and constantly
               keep him on the level of excellence.
                       Furthermore, as we learned from him, the author is not a professional poet, and in his
               hard-working life, he “had much more and better things to do than to put together poems of
                                                     *
               rhymed verse,” according to G. Papini.  Father Hannibal had to rush here and there, where the
               manifold needs of his charitable Institutions summoned him. Usually, his poems were written
               in the midst of the most demanding activities, sometimes also during his travels, even on the
               train. A great number of them were composed for the Saints and their feasts, to be sang by the
               devotees. Thus, they were usually written in a “rather popular and modest style, and always in
               connection with their respective prayers.”
                       There are however compositions “which are not so easy and popular in their style and
               form  but  are  rather  lofty  and  poetic,  according  to  my  limited  capacities  and  little  skills.”
               Among these, let us mention the ‘Octaves to Our Lady of Lourdes; the ‘Roman Reminiscences’;
               the free verses ‘For the death of Carolina Taccone Gallucci and of Santi Nicola Proto’; the
               poem ‘For the death of the Knight Jaculani’, and some others.


               4. The Hymns of July 1

                       The “Hymns for July 1” that celebrate the great Eucharistic Feast of the Institution for
               the first coming and permanence of the sacramental Jesus [in the Chapel of Avignone], were
               published after Father Hannibal’s death. One of the activities of the celebration was a new
               Hymn dedicated to Jesus and another to Mary according to the new title given each year. All
               the communities sung these hymns in their church.
                       He wrote all the poems without any literary preoccupation. It would have been useless
               since  they  were  intended  for  that  crowd  of  children  and  poor  who  were  not  looking  for
               literature. However, we find in them the overflowing heart of Father Hannibal who used the
               occasion of the coming of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament to renew his constant love and
               faithfulness to Him.
                       The Hymns have three parts. The second has general characteristics, explaining and
               singing the new title, while the first and the third reflect the nature and special circumstances

               immense trust in God, and ennobled by the magnificent coat of arms of the great Word of Jesus:
               Pray,  therefore,  the  Lord  of  the  harvest  to  send  out  laborers  in  his  harvest  (Rogate  ergo
               Dominum messis ut mittat operarios in messem suam). The Father recalled and repeated this
               divine Word and command in thousands of ways because it constitutes the great longing of his
               apostolic heart that found in the Rogate the secret of the salvation of souls and of the entire
               world.

                       “The ‘Hymns’ usually open with a cry of joy for the happy return of the Lord, or with
               an ardent invocation to Him by the Institution, which implores Him with sighs in the bitterness
               of His temporary absence.
                       “The last part is a memory of the Eucharistic Mystery. Jesus in the Eucharist reminds
               us about Priesthood, which generates, guards, and distributes the Eucharist to the people who,
               in the Eucharist, experience the salvific effects of the new Title. However, in a very special
               way, the Institution feels and enjoys the same effects since it places its glory in living and being
               consumed around the Tabernacle. These concepts, though repeated so many times, are always
               expressed with new words and ardent insistence, vibrant with holy enthusiasm, and celestial
               fervor.

                       “In addition, in the ‘Hymns’, the Most Holy Virgin, and our many patron Saints are
               seen in this perspective: their heavenly protection mainly bestowed on the Institution in its
               eventful life.” (Di Francia, Hymns for July 1, p. 18)


               5. Some Examples

                       Father Hannibal gathers all his children around the Eucharistic throne of ‘Jesus Most-
               Worthy of Infinite Praise’:

                       Little children snatched from the oblivion
                       Of the danger of an unhappy fate,

                       Little orphans, creatures of God,
                       Pure virgins, consecrated to the Lord,
                       And you all, whose eyes are now wet with tears,
                       Poor people in your abandonment and hardship,
                       All men and women, kneeling in front of his throne,
                       Let us praise Jesus the Savior.

                       To ‘Jesus the Divine Builder’:


                       Come back! Come back! Raise your shouts
                       Bursting with joy from the fervent hearts
                       Let the little flowerbed stand up and smile:
                       A feast day has come for its children.
                       The God of the Altars, the Love of the chosen ones,
                       From the heavens shining in their eternal sapphire
                       From the brilliant stars dancing and turning around,

                       Behold, the ‘Divine Emperor’ approaches:

                       As a bursting of harmonies

                       In a bright sea of splendor,
                       It’s a cry, just one cry
                       Long live, ‘Divine Emperor’!

                       What a profound pain is the absence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament from the empty
               and deserted chapel!

                       It looked like it was crying
                       The little bare, neglected church;
                       The open Tabernacle

                       Seemed to say, “Come back!”
                       “Come back” it seemed to cry
                       The blown-out candles,
                       The faithful hymn was silent
                       On the innocent children’s lips

                       The Rogate is the aim of the Institution:

                       Hail, Jesus! Among the remnants

                       A sprout is blossoming,
                       The beats of your Rogate

                       With its prayer… with your prayer!

                       The glory of the Institution is to immerse itself in the Divine Heart, ‘Ever-Burning

                       Father Di Francia considered his religious poems in the light of his apostolate. He
               wrote, “Since they are directed to the worship and honor of the Saints of the Lord, these little
               things [poems] will be of more profit and good for my poor spirit, though sometimes, they will
               seem to me better than others, stained with my vanity!”
                       We believe however that because of these “little things” the author deserves his place
               of honor among the popular religious poets in the Italian literature.



               6. Poems in Prose

                       Father Hannibal also wrote poems in prose. For special events, he composed poetic
               works in prose entitled ‘Psalms’. However, their poetic surge was so compelling, pressing, and
               vibrating, to enchant the spirit and bring it to the highest contemplation.

                       For the third centennial of St. Louis (1891), he wrote “Lily and Angel” which “The
               Catholic Mother”, a magazine printed in Brescia, published in full, defining it as “a really so
               admirable, beautiful, and so highly inspired canticle. We call it ‘Canticle’ because, though it
               is written in prose, it is a poem and a divinely inspired one to the point, according to us, that
               it has nothing to envy in Solomon’s Canticles.”

                       Only a dozen of such poetic compositions was left to us: one for the golden priestly
               Jubilee  of  St.  Pius  X,  another  for  the  silver  episcopal  Jubilee  of  the  Venerable  Dusmet,
               Archbishop of Catania. Many are dedicated to Our Lady.


               7. Sine Labe! (Without Sin)


                       As a sample, we present the Psalm for the Immaculate:
                       A throb with joy flows over the peaks of Hermon, Amana, and Mount Carmel; the high
               cedars of Lebanon were moved with exultation...

                       God then said to his Angels, ‘Go, gather the vermilion of the roses, the purple of violets,
               the white of jasmines, and the candor of camellias when they are sprinkled with the morning
               dew;
                       Gather for me also the fragrance of all the flowers, the perfume of cinnamon, aloe, and
               all the aromatic scents distilled from the bark of the trees’.
                       The Lord said to his Angels, ‘Bring me the blue of the seas when they are not stirred up
               with gales, and the blue of the sky, stretched as a sash in space;

                       Bring me also the rays of the sun, when in springtime it shines on the valley of Betsaida,
               the shimmering light of the stars shining in the firmament, and the silver beam of the moon,
               mirrored in the fishponds of Hesebon’.
                       Thus, the Angels of the Lord flew on the earth and gathered the vermilion of roses, the
               purple of violets, the white of the jasmines, the brightness of camellias, the fragrance of all the
               flowers and all the aromatic scents distilled from the bark of the trees.

               of the stars and the beams of the moon mirrored in the fish-pools of Hesebon.
                       As they flew passing over the earth, to go back in front of the Most High, they saw the
               children of sin, lying down, trembling and sprinkled with tears, outside Eden, the place of their
               birth; and the Angels consoled them.
                       The Most High was delighted and created the beauty of all beauties, the fragrance of
               all fragrances, and the splendor of all splendors.
                       For this, the Woman was made Immaculate, and She came out of the mind of God as a
               morning star, rising from the east; that is why She was named Mary, which means light.
                       Then the blessing of the Most High pervaded all her soul and the fire of the Holy Spirit
               endowed all her heart with his fire and filled her with all graces.
                       She came down from the firmaments and leaned on the horizon: the heavens bent under
               her feet, the stars throbbed with exultation, and the Angels of the Lord picked up the edge of
               her robe, with the zephyrs blowing in her hair.

                       A great uproar of gales, a loud crash of thousands of warriors fighting with spears and
               armors and dashing their shields on the fields of Amalec.
                       Satan screamed with rage; he opened his jaws as the mouth of the Etna volcano when
               it roars like thunder and sends its flames high.
                       His eyes were flashing like aether in the darkness of the night, his hooked claws like
               the vulture’s, to tear apart the heart of his prey.
                       Blood of his victims poured down from his fangs, his belly filled with the flesh of sin,
               and by turning his tail, he uprooted even the stars of the firmament.
                       Raise, o children of the earth, raise your hands to the heavens and strike up a canticle
               of exultation.

                       Gird your loins with strength; let your feet be always at dancing like those of a young
               deer.
                       Because the Most High does great things, he knocks down the powerful people and
               scatters the armies like a handful of sand trampled by the feet of a passerby. He smashes
               Satan’s head.
                       The Woman has crushed Satan’s head, the Virgin has shattered the head of the dragon;
               the Immaculate has chopped the crest of the great serpent.
                       She won: that is why the peaks of Hermon, Amana, and Mount Carmel throb with joy;
               the high cedars of Lebanon are moved with exultation...
                       For  this  reason,  she  is  hailed  as  the  Queen  of  the  Universe,  the  generations  are
               consoled, and the nature without spirit and life, and the one with spirit and life proclaim:
               eternal praise to the Most High who makes wonders; eternal praise to the Woman without sin
               (sine labe).”
                       This poem written in prose seems to be a wonderful comment on the incomparable
               Dante’s verses:

                       “In thee is pity, in thee tenderness,
                       In thee magnificence, in thee the sum
                       Of all that in creation most can bless”

                                                HIS SPIRITUAL LIFE






               1. The Spirit of Faith

                       The Revered Bishop of Oria, Mons. Antonio Di Tommaso, pointing at Father Hannibal,
               one day, said to one of his priests, “That man wants to become a Saint by force!” By that, he
               meant the commitment and consistency with which Father Hannibal pursued the work of his
               sanctification.
                       For the Father, sanctification was nothing else but growing every day in God’s love and
               in the spirit of total immolation for Him in the service of neighbor. He made this resolution,
               “With all my strength I will try to destroy the old man within me, to mortify my bad habits in
               everything, and to clothe myself with the new man, according to Jesus Christ.”
                       The  heirs  of  the  owners  of  the  Avignone  Houses  sued  the  Father,  as  they  did  not
               consider his purchase legitimate. The case was worrisome, and the Institute was in danger due
               to its great financial problem. Father Di Francia did what he had to do on his side, and he
               worked actively with the lawyers to prepare his defense. He also appointed a heavenly court
               formed by Angels and Saints, for which he established a set of devout practices and asked for
               the contribution of prayers from several communities assisted by him. After that, he placed
               himself quietly into God’s hands. The case was won in the lower court and in the court of
               appeals but was overruled by the highest court. When I received the news, I informed Father
               Hannibal, “Father, we lost the case!” There was no gesture of surprise or wonder. He just
               limited himself to observe, “My dear son, God always wins, He always wins!” Then, as if
               nothing had happened, he started talking about the future pilgrimage, which our community
               had to make to the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Lettera and where he was going to preach the
               sermon.
                       The Father won the case at the new Court of Appeals of Palermo.



               2. Obedience to the Mother Church

                       His submission to the Church was complete and unconditional.
                       He wrote to Fr. Vitale, “To operate scrupulously with the rules of the Holy Church
               means to be always right, like those who follow holy obedience! Obedience to the Holy Mother
               Church, first of all!”
                       When Father Hannibal learned that he was suspected of becoming inclined towards the
               false doctrine of theosophy, in a letter to Mrs. Zùccaro he protested energetically, “This never
               happened. If for just a moment I had admitted this erroneous and false doctrine, I would have
               denied my holy Catholic faith, I would have opposed all the teachings of the Holy Church. The
               false, erroneous, and imaginary doctrine of theosophy is one of the many heresies which has
               appeared in the world... one of the many hallucinations of the human mind. Burn these volumes
               produced by unbalanced minds far from God and from the truth. Hold on to what the Church
               teaches”.

               love in front of the Supreme Pontiff. He suffered for the progress of evil and was pleased with
               the advancement of good.”

                       His devotion to the Pope was boundless, “Up to the last breath of my life, I will always
               consider the Pope as the same person as our Lord Jesus Christ, and with the same love, I will
               love and obey him. All the interests of the Supreme Pontiff will be the lively interest of my
               heart...the sufferings and the worries of the Supreme Pontiff will also be my sufferings and
               worries, and in my inadequate prayers, the first object will be the Supreme Pontiff and all his
               holy intentions.” He prescribed for the Rogationists: “In the preaching and teaching of the
               Christian doctrine, and much more in the education of the youth, we must place every care to
               inspire love, reverence, obedience, and devotion to the Supreme Pontiff. To this end, we will
               make  popular  instructions  on  the  doctrine  about  the  Roman  Pontiff,  especially  about  his
               infallibility,  and  it  will  be  useful  to  remember  the  glorious  events  of  the  Church’s  history
               related to the Supreme Pontiffs.”
                       He suffered immensely for any offense against the Holy Father.
                       In Perugia, Father Hannibal was painfully hurt by a monument that was a permanent
               insult to the Pope: the emblem of the city, the griffin, tearing apart the tiara [the symbol of the
               Pope]! He strongly urged Father Santoro, who was going to listen to Fr. Gavotti, from the
               Center of Morality of Perugia, who had come to Messina for a set of conferences, to tell him
                                                                  11
               to make every effort to put an end to that indecency.
                       His love for the Pope had wonderful filial expressions.
                       When Benedict XV prescribed three days of fasting for the end of the war, declaring
               that he would be the first to give the example, Father Hannibal begged the Pope to exempt
               himself from this mortification, which would be willingly done by him and his communities.
                       Several times he sent the Holy Father a nice basket of tangerines from the garden of our
               House in Oria.

                       He had been highly impressed by a holy picture of Jesus in the tribunals, with the words
               of the Gospel: ‘Jesus indeed kept silent’. He made a very simple reprint, in black, on glossy
               paper  and  sent  a  package  of  it  to  the  Pope,  thinking  that  it  “would  have  been  certainly
               appreciated by the profound piety of the Holy Father.”
                       In 1919, the revolution had turned Italy upside down. Father Hannibal wrote to Mother
               Nazzarena, “Times are becoming terrible! More than war! Socialism and anarchy start to
               dominate! The government is powerless to repress them. We do not know where we will end.”
               He was worried about his communities, but he thought of the Pope: “We must not forget the
               Supreme Pontiff, our Holy Father Benedict XV! God forbid that they may storm the Vatican...
               it seems that we are still far away from this, but the danger is there... Let us pray for the Holy
               Father and offer our life for that of the Supreme Pontiff!”


               3. The Vows of Trust


                       His confidence in the Lord was limitless and he committed himself to this with three
               vows. 1) Never mistrust the goodness and mercy of God regarding his own sins, in the certainty
               that all are and will be forgiven him, provided that he always addresses himself to the Lord


                  11
                     The monument recalled the 1859 revolution largely exploited by the anticlerical propaganda under the name
               of Massacres of Perugia. The indecency has been removed a long time ago.

               by his Institutions, he committed himself never to mistrust the love of the Sacred Hearts of
               Jesus and Mary, which will free him of every evil, even by doing wonders of mercy and love.
               3)  Relying  on  the  promises  of  Jesus,  he  committed  himself  with  a  vow  to  believe  in  the
               effectiveness of prayer, which will always be answered, provided it is done with the right
               intention, humility, fervor, perseverance, and union with God’s adorable will.


               4. Spirit of Prayer

                       Father Di Francia teaches: “Interior life, union with God, zeal, charity, and thirst for
               souls are powerful weapons for the man of God. With these weapons, he does great things for
               the  Lord  and  for  souls,  not  so  much  with  his  personal  works,  new  sacrifices,  gold,  and
               intelligence, rather for an invisible, or better, a visible contribution of the Divine Power. This
               weapon, which wins over everything, this golden key, which opens the treasures of the divine
               graces, is prayer. I once heard the preaching of a servant of God say an unforgettable, sharp
                                                                               12
               sentence, “God is omnipotent, but prayer is the most omnipotent.”
                       The Rogationist “must base the hope of his own true growth on the spirit of prayer. If
               the great means of prayer is properly used, everything will go well, but if prayer fails, the
               sources of graces will dry up and everything will perish. May God spare us!”
                       Holiness is tied to prayer.  “The saints were very wise in using this great means, not
               only for their salvation but also to grow in every heroic virtue, to win over and knock down
               every disorderly passion, to win over every difficulty, to overcome the entire hell, to sanctify
               and save countless souls, and to perform great wonders. They made use of their efforts and all
               kinds of sacrifices, but neither the efforts nor the sacrifices would have any value without their
               fervent and unceasing prayer.”
                       All of Father Hannibal’s life was a prayer. He lived by prayer. The collection of the
               prayers written by him for the most varied occasions amounts to several volumes. He petitioned
               our Lord and the Most Holy Virgin, the Angels, and his patron Saints to progress in the virtues
               and to grow in divine love. He did not hesitate, with childlike simplicity, to go down to the
               particular needs of the day, ‘Today I need this amount of money, You take care of it. Today we
               are without bread, You provide it. That creditor has shown himself so good to us, he needs
               money and we cannot pay, we entrust ourselves to You’...





                  12
                     Father Hannibal refers to Fr. Cusmano and his visit to the Avignone slums in May 1885. The Father wrote,
               “I will never forget his very fervent speech. The topic was ‘the humble and fervent prayer as the maker of the
               works undertaken for the glory of God and the good of souls’. Fr. Cusmano used to put his entire soul before God,
               that is why prayer penetrates the heavens. It seemed that he annihilated himself before the Most High. It seemed
               that he reproduced that profound, intimate humility and perfect loving trust, with which he had already taken the
               habit of annihilating himself in the feeling of one's own nothingness in front of the divine presence. That is,
               throwing his heart to Jesus, his Supreme Good, with that fervor, by which he had snatched so many graces from
               the adorable Heart of the Divine Redeemer. The conclusion of his speech was sublime! He said, ‘If God is all-
               powerful (onnipotente), the prayer done this way is most all-powerful’ (onnipotentissima). This expression struck
               me, instructed me, and revived me. Thirty-eight years have passed since that day, and I remember that sermon as
               if I heard it only yesterday. When he spoke of the effects of such prayer, at times, he used to accompany his words
               with a smile that was somehow gentle or I would almost say, heavenly. After he finished the Mass, I was going to
               celebrate Mass and he helped me put on the vestments.  I wanted to refuse, but he said to me, “for him to whom
               to serve is to reign...” (1923 Report)


                                                           94]]></page><page Index="95"><![CDATA[Father Hannibal never ceased to ask for the spirit of prayer, “Dear Jesus, divine teacher,
               you who have ordered prayer as a necessary means for salvation, grant us its spirit. Give me
               a spirit of kindness and goodness in all things, the spirit of perseverance with complete victory
               over my senses and gluttony.”
                       Father Hannibal wanted people to learn how to pray, more with the plea of the heart
               than with pre-set forms. “The person trained in mental prayer, in meditation, and mortification,
               who feels the love of Jesus, the living interests of the Heart of Jesus, the living commitment to
               know Jesus and to love him, who feels ardent compassion and zeal for souls; this person of
               virtue and sacrifice does not need to learn formulas of prayers from books. The Spirit dwelling
               in him will make him moan with unutterable groans. Who can say how many continuous graces
               this person will be able to snatch from the innermost recesses of the Heart of Jesus for the
               entire Holy Church, for all the souls journeying on earth, for those in purgatory, and for the
               entire world?”
                       As long as Father Hannibal was healthy, praying during the night was customary for
               him. We don’t know about extraordinary gifts enjoyed by him concerning prayer. It is certain
               however that the various degrees of prayer described by St. Theresa and by St. John of the
               Cross did not present any difficulty for him, and, as wisely observed by Fr. Vitale, this does
               not seem to be easily explainable without some personal experience of it.
                       Did Father Hannibal have distractions in prayer? We do not think so. At least habitually
               according to what he wrote, which certainly reflects his personal situation, “We think that when
               a person is really mortified and diligent in his works, distractions in prayer seldom occur, and
               they are easily dispelled.”
                       The fruit of his prayer was his habitual union with God.

                       Canon  Celona  observes,  “His  mind  was  plunged  in  God.”  An  experienced  Jesuit
               missionary, Fr. Fazio, coming from a conversation with the Father, exclaimed with admiration,
               “This man is entirely filled with God!”
                       If such was the prayer of Father Hannibal, is it any wonder that the answer from Heaven
               would come often through unthinkable ways?

               5. Humility

                       Father  Hannibal’s  humility  was  profound.  According  to  him,  he  was  “a  miserable
               sinner, the abomination of heaven and earth, who no longer has the right to the air he breathes,
               or to the soil on which he treads, and who should stay forever under Lucifer’s foot.” Reflecting
               on the many graces he received from the Lord, he declared, “Not only do I feel myself sinking
               in my nothingness, but I am seized by great fear, thinking that all these interventions of divine
               mercy can pile up for me a new stack of debts towards the Divine Justice.”
                       In 1887, he jealously kept a holy picture that happened to come into his hands: the Child
               Jesus holding a large cross, reclining next to a donkey lying on the ground. He felt represented
               by that animal and on the back of the holy picture, he wrote this prayer, “O Jesus, good Master,
               have pity on your little donkey! See how wounded and languishing it is. Give it the food of your
               grazing pastures and make it drink from your clear springs! Ride him, O Jesus, good Master,
               and excite him with the power and kindness of your word to walk in your ways and to take you
               where you want. Make it obedient to your will under the direction of your compassionate hand!
               O Jesus, good Master, if your little donkey does not want to do this, beat it with your Holy
               Cross and make it perfectly docile to your beckons. Let the little donkey know you as its only
               and true Master, serve you with patience, humility, meekness, and always carry you where you
               want. Amen.”

                                           *
               founder’, ‘smelter’, ‘glutton’  and in a letter to Melanie he signed as ‘Founder, Superior and
               Director of the Castles in the sky’. In the solemn declaration he made on July 1 and 2, 1913,
               he stated that the Work was founded by God, and the Most Holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary
               were its divine Superiors.
                       He wrote to Fr. Palma, “I see that I just ruined everything, that my life was only a chain
               of mistakes, errors, inexperience, temerities, and what is worse, bad examples.” Another time,
               after a failure, “It is very clear to me that the Lord did so for my sins, and I am not happy that
               so many men and women in our Institutes often bear the punishment for my sins! May the
               Almighty credit it to their merit!”
                       In his self-eulogy Father Hannibal wrote, “That deceased [Father Hannibal is speaking
               of himself!] wants it to be known that in the entire course of his earthly life, he caused many
               souls and people to suffer and aggrieved many hearts! He asks forgiveness from God and from
               all for every bad example and for any suffering caused to whomever!”
                       To Fr. Vitale: “I say always that when I leave, things work better and many difficulties
               are overcome. Long live Jesus!”
                       Father Hannibal thought that he had ruined the work of God and therefore he called
               himself a botcher, or rather the sole botcher of the entire Work, while the others were busy
               building it.
                       He used to tell us, “What is this Work in God's plans? I imagine it as a large building
               with several floors, stately decorations, large courtyards, and vast halls; or as an immense
               garden, with parks, villas, farmhouses, etc. How much good we could do! How many souls to
               save! How much glory for our Lord and consolation for his most gentle Heart! This is the
               Work. How I wish that God had found another person instead of me or had found greater
               fidelity in me! However, alas! My sins have reduced the Work to a miserable little plant, with
               a stunted life ... My sins have kept the Work confined to the misery of the Avignone Houses!”
                       About his own Work, he wrote that it was “directed by me with negligence, but I was
               unable to destroy it, as the Lord Jesus protected it against any blunder of mine.” Later he
               stated, “I worked more to destroy than to build! And if I was unable to destroy everything, that
               was because the work, as it seems, is God’s and the Lord did not allow it!”
                       Humility was his preferred virtue since it is the virtue of the Sacred Heart.

                       One day, the young students were lively playing in the courtyard, and when they saw
               Father Hannibal, they ran to him. He asked them, “Dear boys, what is the virtue that makes us
               more acceptable to the heart of God?”
                       “Humility, Father, humility!”
                       He smiled, with pleasure: we had read his thought.
                       “Very well, it’s really humility.” Then, he added, “Go on playing” and he left.
                       In his “Letter to the Friends” meant for the people of righteous mind, even though not
               practicing religion, Father Hannibal tried to make them understand the value of humility with
               an argument suited to them, “Some people believe that to humble oneself means to depreciate
               one’s self and that humility is abasement. On the contrary, humility makes us great and lifts us
               up to God. In fact, humility is the death of pride, arrogance, ambition, and conceit: all passions
               that devalue the reasonable person. Humility makes us courteous, prudent, and agreeable to
               others. Just as pride makes us demanding with others, humility, which is the mother of modesty



               *  E.N. In Italian, the words sfondatore (de-founder, destroyer), fonditore (smelter), mangiatore (glutton) sound
               very similar to ‘fondatore’ (founder).

               and attracts respect and admiration from others.”


               6. Mortification

                       His mortification was rigid. First, Father Hannibal made clear the necessity for external
               mortification, “Those who despise and have no consideration for the corporal penances, saying
               that the interior ones are sufficient, show that they lack the true spirit, wisdom, and the true
               science of the saints, and do not aspire to develop firmly their inner virtues. Let us remember
               the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, “If you do not do penance, all of you will perish,” as well
               as the threefold cry of penance of the Holy Virgin at the grotto of Lourdes through Bernadette,
               ‘Penance, penance, penance!’
                        “It is true that the above-mentioned words of our Lord Jesus Christ refer first of all to
               the interior penances, that is, the repentance for our own sins because of supernatural reasons.
               However,  the  word  of  God  has  infinite  extended  meanings.  When  he  insisted  on  penance,
               because without it the Lord says that we will all perish, he intended also to speak of voluntary
               penance. Without them, the people called to perfection will perish, if they could do penances
               but do not do them because of their carelessness at least when it comes to achieving religious
               perfection. From this comes incalculable evil, a detriment for one’s spirit that can produce
               incomplete repentance or a delayed resolution to go to confession and then all that follows,
               among which is the danger of totally extinguishing the spirit and losing one’s holy vocation.”
                       However,  Father  Hannibal  did  not  fail  to  specify  that  “true  penance  consists  of
               practicing  the  holy  interior  virtues”  and  he  wanted  “everyone  to  embrace  sufferings,
               mortifications, contradictions, illnesses, worries, and whatever that comes from the Divine Will
               which ordains or allows them. Any labor performed in the service of God and neighbor can
               also be sound and holy penance.”
                       He warns against possible and even false beliefs which we may encounter regarding
               penances: “There are people who easily deceive themselves with bodily penances: they are
               capable of doing very harsh penances and then without misgivings disregard holy obedience,
               humility,  fraternal  charity,  proper  fulfillment  of  tasks,  etc.  These  people  by  doing  bodily
               penance believe that they are already holy, and therefore they confirm themselves in the bad
               practice of virtues and become obstinate, untreatable, negligent, irritable, etc.” In these cases,
               Father Hannibal prescribes that the penances that they do whimsically should not be allowed.
               Rather, let other penances, sensible ones, be imposed on these people.
                       Regarding the practice of penance, we kept a true collection of instruments of penance,
               cilices, small chains, and sashes provided with steel spikes, which Father Hannibal used. As a
               youth, he wore down his health with vigils and fasting. His food was regularly made bitter with
               aloe or knapweed or other powders.
                       However, his most important mortification was the vigilance over himself. He was
               always in control of his words, facial expressions, gestures, smiles. He never took a vacation
               or a free hour for a walk. According to the biblical expression, he continually carried his soul
               into his own hands; and his whole life was always present to him, as he confessed with candid
               simplicity, “I see in my mind all the countless sins I committed in my life, although, by God’s
               grace I confide that they were never grave. Nevertheless, who can weigh the malice of a defect?
               The Lord let me understand the many faults of my youth, over more than sixty years ago, and
               how no fault has remained without punishment. Indeed, the Lord made me understand that He
               gave me that specific punishment to purify me from that particular fault.  I remember the words

               out the purification of your sins. However, we must always have great trust in the Lord.”


               7. Poverty

                       We can infer how much Father Hannibal loved poverty from the life he wanted to lead
               among the poor! Poverty was the true richness for him, “a very precious pearl and a sturdy
               foundation of the Institute.”
                       Oh, the poverty of the Avignone slums! The first time I set foot there - it was in 1917,
               and we were no longer in the heroic times! I could not refrain from writing my impressions to
               Fr. Vitale, in Oria; “The poverty of those houses would not raise the envy of St. Francis of
               Assisi!”
                       The clothes of the Father were always clean and spotless, due also to the upbringing he
               received from his family. They were made of ordinary material, faded and worn out, and had
               to last as long as possible… In the early days of the Work, the Conference of St. Vincent de
               Paul took care of replacing them.
                       In his small room in Oria, he hung his clothes on nails driven into the wall, covering
                                                      *
               them with a cloth to prevent rust stains!
                       He always traveled in the cheapest manner. Instead of suitcases, he rolled his things in
               bags or large handkerchiefs the way the poor and peasants do. When he lost or broke something,
               he accused himself of lack of poverty and begged so that the community would not suffer for
               it, and usually imposed on himself some renunciation as atonement, especially during meals.

                       This was his teaching, “Let the Works, born in the misery of the Avignone district
               always remember their origin, and remember that, as much as possible, everything must have
               the mark of that original poverty. Let the furniture, the household goods, the refectory, and
               everything be poor. Let the food also be poor and simple although always sufficient.” He also
               wanted that the Rogationists “in cases of controversies and discussions on points of the rules,
               should lean always to the rigid choice of evangelical poverty.”


               8. Chastity


                       On chastity, we have Father Hannibal’s explicit confession to Fr. Vitale, “Thank God,
               I don’t know temptations in this matter.” In his self-eulogy, “He declares, for the glory of God,
               that he never knew action, called dishonest, obscene, etc., and he could never understand what
               pleasure, if ever, could be found in them.”


               9. Obedience

                       Father Hannibal exalts obedience as “the virtue of perfect sanctification and perfect
               union with God, because by obeying the Superior and the rules we do the will of the Almighty
               perfectly... Holy religious obedience is the surest, safest, and shortest way to reach a greater
               perfection. The Religious House, where everyone obeys religiously, is a kingdom of God on

               God, zeal for the divine glory, humility, poverty, chastity, charity, and one’s vocation itself will
               fail.”

                       He made this resolution: “I will never be obstinate in my judgment and opinion but
               through exterior obedience, I also intend to obey internally by conforming my judgment and
               my ways of thinking to those of my superiors.” To Fr. Vitale, who one day wondered upon
               seeing him behaving differently, he declared that it was the desire of his Superior, “And this is
               enough for me to follow him blindly.”
                       His immediate Superior was the Ordinary, and we find in his self-eulogy a sentence in
               connection with him, which requires an explanation. In fact, he maintains himself guilty in his
               relations with the Superior, “He [Father Hannibal] alienated the mind of Monsignor D'Arrigo,
               Archbishop of Messina from himself and from the Pious Work.” On the contrary, examining
               the matter, we do not find any fault in Father Hannibal.

                       The Father was appreciated and well-liked by Cardinal Guarino, while Canon D'Arrigo
               opposed him. When Canon D'Arrigo became Archbishop, he felt some distrust toward Father
               Di Francia, thinking that the Father was antagonistic toward him because of his attachment to
               Cardinal Guarino. Nothing could be more wrong. “The Servant of God was equally faithful to
               Cardinal  Guarino  as  to  Mons.  D'Arrigo.  A  fidelity  born  exclusively  out  of  supernatural
               principles, as he saw in the Archbishops, the representatives of God and the Church. If Mons.
               D'Arrigo did not understand this, the reason must be sought either in his preconceived notions
               or  in  the  environment  that  he  had  formed  around  himself.  Monsignor  D'Arrigo  made  it
               something personal and this was completely outside the thought of Father Hannibal who, the
               Archbishop thought, would have opposed his government due to personal resentment.” (Cf.
               PAPASOGLI TADDEI, Annibale M. Di Francia, p. 275).

                                                          JESUS!





               1. Fall in Love with Jesus Christ!

                        “We can do nothing more pleasing to the very loving Jesus than to tell him: ‘I love
               you!’ He desires and wants this from us. Let us then repeat it often to Him. When we cannot do
               it with our lips, let us say it with our hearts. Let us tell him that with every beat of our hearts
               we mean to repeat: ‘I love you!’ With these words, Father Hannibal presented to us a genuine
               portrait of himself: a person entirely inflamed with the love of Jesus.
                       “Fall in love with Jesus Christ!” was the advice he gave to Fr. Vitale who was then a
               cleric, during one of the encounters he had with him, revealing with these words, and even
               more with the expression in which he uttered them, all the richness of love which filled his
               heart.
                       Jesus was the mirror that Father Hannibal always kept in front of himself, and the full
               commitment  of  his  life  intended  to  reproduce  in  himself  that  divine  image.  In  a  personal
               composition which he entitled “Imitation of Jesus, my Lord”, there is a complete loving study
               of the words, actions, and inner feelings for Jesus, to try to conform himself to that Divine
               Model in everything.

                       In particular, here are Father Hannibal’s main devotions regarding the adorable person
               of our Lord.



               2. The Most Holy Name

                       “Long live Jesus! Long live Jesus!” was his preferred short prayer, because for him, as
               for St. Bernard, “Jesus” was honey to the mouth, harmony to the ears, and joy to the heart. In
               all his Houses, he had the entire month of January dedicated to this Name, and the month
               concluded with the solemn novena that he preached for thirty-four consecutive years.
                       On January 31, the day of the feast, Father Hannibal had obtained from the Holy See
               permission to celebrate two Masses for the Name of Jesus. At noon, the ‘Great Supplication’
               was offered to the Eternal Father. Father Hannibal intended this to store graces for all the needs
               of the Work for the entire year. The Supplication was based on the Divine Promise, “Truly, I
               say to you: whatever you ask the Father in my name, He will give it to you (Jn. 16: 23). Not to
               have faith in this divine promise - Father Di Francia said - is like denying the faith in the very
               Divinity of Jesus Christ!”



               3. The Child Jesus

                       He wished the Christmas novena to be accompanied by pious devotions suited to inspire
               love and enthusiasm among his little ones. They had to prepare the small mattress, the small
               pillow, the blanket, the swaddling clothes, etc., with particular practices and acts of virtue, so

               Child, and wrote a pamphlet with 25 prayers to help people in practicing the ‘spiritual infancy’.


               4. The Passion

                       The Passion of Jesus was the topic of his daily meditation and he imposed it on his
               Congregations. A photograph of Father Hannibal shows him with a crucifix in his hands, and
               it is very significant. It tells us that the light emanating from the Crucified Lord enlightens the
               characteristics of his sanctity. The purpose of his life was to know and love Jesus Crucified and
               to make Him known and loved by others. It recalls also those years when, in teaching catechism
               to the children, he loved to present the crucified Christ to them, pointing to the wounds, the
               nails, the crown of thorns, and the open Heart to let the children understand how much Jesus
               loved us!
                       He had a particular devotion for the Holy Face of our Lord and he dedicated the month
               of April to this. He wanted the spread of the Holy Image of the Shroud that was drawn by
                      *
               Celine,  the sister of St. Therese of the Child Jesus, and he wanted a large picture of it to be
               displayed in all the Houses. He pointed out its exquisite characteristics: “We could say that an
               angel has guided the hand of the pious artist. It succeeded in showing marvelously not only the
               stains of blood, the wounds, the swelling of the right cheek, the bruise on the nose, the swelling
               of  the  right  eye  but  even  more,  the  gentle  serenity,  the  profound  calm,  the  concentrated
               suffering, and the sublime majesty of the Divine Face!”


               5. The Most Precious Blood

                       In  Messina,  the  devotion  to  the  Most  Precious  Blood  was  popular.  When  Father
               Hannibal  was  still  young,  “Christ’s  Blood”  had  already  been  sung  by  his  mentor,  Felice
               Bisazza, with verses that are among the best he penned:

                       Blood of the first martyr,
                       Blood of the Man-God,
                       Reddening our altars,
                       Victim of my fault
                       Victim of peaceful love,
                       I turn myself to you!

                       However, in time, and especially because of the revolution, the devotion faded away. It
               was to the credit of the young Hannibal, when, as a cleric, he revived this devotion once again
               with his preaching.
                       In his Houses, the entire month of July was dedicated to the Most Precious Blood,
               especially in a spirit of atonement. He wrote, “We could present this great price of our ransom
               to the eternal Divine Father for the salvation of the Holy Church through the abundance of
               holy laborers, and thus for the salvation of the entire world.”

               photograph of the Shroud of Turin, upon the urgings of her sister, St. Therese of Lisieux.

               Glory be to the Father… with open arms, interjecting the short invocation: We salute you,
               Immaculate Blood of the Man-God, precious price for the redemption of sinners.



               6. The Sacred Heart

                       The devotion to the Heart of Jesus was the queen of devotions in the heart of Father
               Hannibal, because “when we say ‘Heart of Jesus’, we mean his infinite goodness, love, charity,
               and mercy.”
                       Then he explains, “In the very holy life of Jesus, everything was love... however, when
               we look at Jesus in the maternal womb, in the stable, in his secluded life, in his miracles, in his
               patience,  we  see  his  love  in  its  external  manifestations.  This  is  not  the  most  beautiful
               contemplation of love. A more beautiful sight is that of looking inside the holy humanity of
               Jesus Christ, to find the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus: all the love of Jesus is enclosed in that
               Divine Heart.”
                       Therefore, “Nothing is more pleasing, gentle, and dear to me than the devotion to the
               Most Holy Heart of Jesus. I want that all the interests of this Divine Heart be my interests.”
               Thus, we can explain the original title that Father Hannibal gave globally to his Institution in
               the field of beneficence and religious life: “Pious Work of the Interests of the Heart of Jesus.”
                       “I will take pride in offering myself as a lover, a son, a slave, and a victim of this Divine
               Heart, and I will do my utmost to make it known and loved all over the world.”

                       He wrote for his children, “You know how this Divine Heart is everything for us. We
               are consecrated to this Divine Heart, to which we belong, to which the Work belongs, to which
               all our poor efforts and intentions belong. All our Houses, Orphanages, and works with the
               externs belong to the Heart of Jesus; all belong to that Divine Heart.”
                       In our churches and chapels, he wanted the Heart of Jesus to be in the place of honor,
               and he liked the image of the Sacred Heart extending his hands as if to receive all his children
               under his protection.

                       He extends his arms for protection,
                       As if to tell us: Children, I am here:
                       Do not be afraid...


                       However, Father Hannibal insisted on a particular aspect of the devotion to the Sacred
               Heart and he wanted it to be considered as a special characteristic of the humble and small
               Institute of the Rogationists, considering it as a special gift to them from the Lord. This aspect
               is the meditation of the “intimate and very painful passion of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. This
               passion embraces those intimate and ineffable pains and bitterness, which the divine Redeemer
               Jesus experienced all his life in his Most Holy Heart at the sight of all the sins, of all the human
               ingratitude, and of all the souls that would have been eternally lost.” In connection with this,
               he wrote moving reflections and prayers.
                       Father Hannibal sees the Rogate in relation to the intimate passion of the Heart of Jesus.
               The people who consider it with attention “cannot remain indifferent in front of the interests
               of that Divine Heart. Then that divine word [the ‘Rogate’] will resound in their ears and in
               obedience to that command, they will find a great means to console the Most Sacred Heart of
               Jesus in his sufferings!”

                       Consoling the Heart of Jesus is the specific meaning of Father Hannibal’s devotion to
               the Sacred Heart. The words in the Sacred Scripture, “I looked for comforters, but I found
               none.” (Ps 69, 20) struck him deeply, as well as those addressed by Jesus to St. Margaret Mary
               Alacoque: “At least you give me this consolation of repairing men’s ingratitude!” His whole
               life was committed to giving consolation to the Sacred Heart and he made it a rule for all his
               followers. “As the principle and the end of the rule, it is prescribed that the Rogationists do
               everything  for  the  greater  consolation  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus”  (‘Ad  maiorem
               consolationem Cordis Jesu!’ - A.M.C.C.J). Thus, as the Jesuits have as their motto: for the
               greater glory of God; the Salesians: give me souls, take away the rest; the followers of Don
               Orione: Souls, souls; the Rogationists have also their adage: for the greater consolation of the
               Heart of Jesus!
                       How  many  times,  we  heard  Father  Hannibal,  in  the  impetus  of  his  love  for  Jesus
               changing ‘for the greater’ into ‘for the greatest’, or ‘for the infinite’ consolation of your Heart,
               O Jesus!


               8. July 1


                       Jesus is always with us, alive and true in the Blessed Sacrament of the Altar. Thus, the
               place that Father Hannibal gives to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament in his Institutes is this: “The
               loving, fruitful, dutiful, and permanent center of this Pious Institute of the interests of Jesus is
               Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. From now on, everyone must know that Jesus in the Blessed
               Sacrament is the true, effective, and immediate founder of this Pious Institute. We may say of
               this foundation, “God did something new.” In fact, usually, the Lord grants a founder who is
               rich with his graces and gifts to his Institutions. However, our Lord himself in the sacred
               Tabernacle wanted jealously to be the real founder of this Institute, which was born to promote
               the Heart of Jesus’  divine command that has been neglected for so many centuries, into an
               Institution, without the intermediation of a founder as we ordinarily intend it. All the graces,
               help, enlightenment, and divine providence have all poured out from his divine Heart in the
               Blessed Sacrament.”
                       Truly, Father Hannibal felt and wanted all of us to feel the real presence of Jesus in the
               Tabernacle, as the center of attraction of the House!

                       Before making the first chapel sacramental, for two years, he fostered in his boys, girls,
               and people he assisted the living desire for the divine presence of Jesus through ardent prayers
               and moving poems, which resounded with nostalgic notes in the Avignone Houses:

                       Open, O Heaven of heavens,
                       Let the Beloved come down to us
                       Enclosed in the host, as the victim

                       Of his divine love
                       Let our beloved Redeemer
                       Come among his children!

                       On  July  1,  1886,  the  octave  of  the  Feast  of  Corpus  Christi,  Jesus  in  the  Blessed
               Sacrament took possession of the first Tabernacle of the Work in the Avignone slums.

               Shepherd in the midst his lambs, as a divine farmer to cultivate himself the small plant whose
               germ contained the small seed of the Divine Rogate! He came as a very loving Father in the
               midst of his children to form for himself a small family, which would live on his Flesh and his
               Blood and to enable it to receive from his holy lips the divine command, “Pray the Lord of the
               harvest to send out laborers into his harvest!”
                       Since then, he wanted to renew every year the loving expectation of Jesus in the Blessed
               Sacrament in ways suitable to awaken the fervor of the people. In the last days of June, the
               Blessed Sacrament was removed [from the tabernacle], and three times a day, the prayers and
               hymns were repeated. On July 1, Jesus returned with a new name: King, Pontiff, Father, Good
               Shepherd, etc. Every year, there were new hymns of praise, springing from the heart of Father
               Hannibal, which later became a volume of verses entitled “The Hymns of July 1”.



               9. The Holy Mass

                       The Eucharistic presence of Jesus leads us to deal with the Holy Mass.
                       “All the Rogationists will have a very high concept of the great sacrifice of the Holy
               Mass. For us, the Holy Mass will be the great means to obtain every mercy and grace from the
               Almighty God and to satisfy our duties of adoration and thanksgiving to his Divine Majesty...
               When  we  celebrate  the  Holy  Mass,  we  shall  see  immense  rivers  of  graces  and  blessings
               spreading all over the Church and the world.
                       “We must see the person of Jesus Christ, victim and priest who, in the Holy Mass,
               renews  all  the  mysteries  of  his  earthly  life,  from  his  incarnation  to  his  death,  from  his
               resurrection to his ascension...”

                       “In the Holy Mass, we must then contemplate this display of faith and join Jesus Christ
               in adoring, offering satisfaction for us and for all, begging even for the smallest spiritual and
               temporal grace for us and for all, and asking graces upon graces and endless mercy for us and
               for all.
                       “The prayers we say during the Holy Mass are joined to those of our Lord Jesus Christ,
               who immolates himself on the altar to obtain all the graces for us. Spiritual authors teach that
               those who, for their negligence or lack of faith and devotion, do not receive graces during the
               Holy Mass, will never receive them.”
                       Except in some special cases, the Father did not accept stipends for the Holy Mass. He
               offered it for the glory of the Holy Trinity, in thanksgiving for the divine benefits, for the needs
               of the Holy Church and the Work, for the benefactors, and the like. He used to announce it to
               the communities before the Mass, so that they could participate in his intentions.
                       Indeed, he celebrated the Mass with great faith. Absorbed in the contemplation of the
               great mystery, he no longer belonged to this world! Tears of love and tenderness often flowed
               on his face, expressing his intimate participation in the sacrifice of the divine Victim. Thus, it
               is no wonder that many people looked for a place where they could see him better and follow
               his celebration.

                       When I served him as an altar boy, I prepared myself very early, by the side of the altar,
               with the cruets in my hands for the ablution. It was a spiritual joy for me to contemplate his
               face, which seemed to bear the shining reflection of his union with the Lord! He noticed that,
               and told me, “Son, you must leave to the priest the freedom to linger with God! You must kneel
               on the step, almost behind the celebrant, and for the ablution, you will stand only after the
               priest has consumed the Holy Blood, and not before!

                       Father Hannibal was an apostle of daily Communion, which he began to practice when
               he was 17, even before his putting on the clerical habit. He regretted that he had not been
               allowed to receive it daily since his First Communion. We find in his notes that he wanted to
               make up for the missing communions by reciting 2,355 spiritual communions, corresponding
                                    th
                                           th
               to the days from his 7  to 17  year [= from the day of his First Communion to the time he was
               allowed to receive it daily].
                       He wanted the day of the First Communion to leave a permanent mark on the life of his
               boys and girls, and therefore it had to be done in a solemn and memorable way. He wanted the
               Sisters and educators “to show themselves so happy on that day for the holy celebration to
               impress the girls and boys they assisted, edifying and instilling in them an ever greater desire
               to  receive  Jesus  in  the  Blessed  Sacrament.”  The  follow  up  shall  continue  after  the  First
               Communion, and if there are girls and boys who, with the permission of their confessor, want
               to receive daily communion, they (= educators) should keep an eye on them, that they may
               always receive it with increasing fervor and devotion. Otherwise, it would be better for them
               to receive communion with a good preparation and thanksgiving, every Sunday and major
               festivities.

                       Noticing that among the Sisters several did not remember their First Communion, he
               thought of a “First Communion Renewal”. Through particular purification of the conscience
               and special prayers and practices, each Sister had to renew the fervor of her first encounter with
               the Sacramental Jesus.
                       Father  Hannibal  had  written  about  Holy  Communion  for  his  communities,  which
               cannot be forgotten because “their sanctification and salvation, as well as the expansion and
               stability of the Institution, depends particularly” on Holy Communion. We know that the fruits
               of Communion are bound to the disposition of the one who receives it. Woe if there is sin! We
               would have a sacrilege, the greatest damage that could befall a soul.
                       Father  Hannibal  remarks,  “However,  we  have  to  consider  seriously  also  another
               damage, to be avoided at any cost, effort, and sacrifice, and by devotedly compelling one’s self
               to it.” This happens when the religious person “approaches the Holy Eucharistic table with
               some imperfections that he doesn’t want to acknowledge and correct.” Then “what profit can
               be gained by that person? Because of God’s right judgment, that person becomes even more
               blind, makes himself more irresponsible, confirms himself in his obstinacy, and becomes more
               angry and impatient...”
                       Instead, “Let the person come to the holy table of the Angels with an angelic heart, very
               profound humility, burning love, and living faith. Let her approach the Eucharist with loving
               confidence and with a burning desire; let her receive Jesus with hunger and thirst. All her
               natural affections, sentiments of the heart, human faculties and sensibilities, everything must
               be transformed into this spiritual intelligence and hunger and thirst for Jesus.” In fact, “Jesus
               in the Eucharist is the bread that fills the hungry ones and leaves empty those unfortunate who
               do not hunger and thirst for the Supreme Good.”
                       When he celebrated in the communities, before the Holy Mass, after reminding the
               intention for which it had to be offered, without fail he would talk about Holy Communion to
               excite the people’s fervor. In the festivities and sometimes on weekdays, he would intentionally
               add  a  dialogue  immediately  before  distributing  Communion,  where  he  transmitted  to  the
               children all the fire of his spirit for the Sacramental Jesus.
                       He was rigorous and demanding in the preparation, and especially in the thanksgiving
               for Holy Communion “which is to be followed not just by a transitory thanksgiving, but by a
               complex of thanksgivings which should thus become a thanksgiving throughout the entire day,

               thanksgiving has to be done, so that the entire life of the Rogationists and of the Daughters of
               Divine Zeal, in whatever way it is spent, would be a perennial preparation and thanksgiving
               for Holy Communion.

                                                           MARY






               1. The Name of Mary

                       Gentle Mary! You the breath

                       Of his ardent sighs,
                       You the light, by which he splendidly
                       Enlightened the peoples:
                       He made you his arbiter,
                       He drew all hearts to You!

                       These verses, which Father Hannibal wrote in a hymn to St. Louis M. Grignion de
               Montfort can fully be applied to him in the fullness of their meaning. He always loved Our
               Lady with tenderness and fervor, and worked untiringly to make her loved by everyone: he was
               completely Marian.
                       His parents’ devotion had set the name of Mary on all the children as their second name;
               to  Hannibal,  instead,  it  was  registered  as  the  first  name,  on  both  the  baptismal  and  civil
               certificates. It was a mistake, but Father Hannibal was happy about that and was proud of it.
               He said to us, “I think, that the devil must have quivered with rage, as the Virgin showed to
               take me under her particular protection, without which I could not be saved.”

                       The love for Mary increased continuously in his heart together with that for God: two
               inseparable  loves,  as  he  wanted  those  names  to  be  inseparable.  And  from  here  comes  his
               salutation, ‘Praised be Jesus and Mary!’ which he introduced in his communities,
                       He wanted all the Daughters of Divine Zeal to be named after the august name of Mary,
               but they had to submit a special application pressingly insisting and urging him to grant it with
               a special decree. This concession was intended to commit the Sisters to a special love for the
               Most Holy Virgin through the imitation of her virtues and the perfect regular observance, under
               penalty of the withdrawal of the concession.
                       He gave them the coffee-colored habit to entrust them to Our Lady of Mount Carmel
               and the Augustinian belt to recall precisely Our Lady of the Belt.
                       To attract more protection from the Holy Virgin over him, Father Hannibal became a
               tertiary of the Carmelite Order. Moreover, when the Lord’s call to Avignone did not yet seem
               definite to him, he even thought of entering the Carmelite Order “after entrusting the pious
               little Work to a trustworthy person.”  His humility did not allow him to see that he was that
               chosen person. He gave up his dream but in his spirit, he remained a Carmelite forever.

                       He placed his poetic inspiration at the service of Our Lady. In 1868, he promised:

                       In my verses, I will sing to you,

                       O Holy, immortal Queen!

                        And he sang to her for about sixty years, laying his harp at the feet of the Queen seated
               at the right hand of the King, and contemplating a mother who is all kindness and mercy:


                       From the right hand of God Redeemer
                       The mighty scepter is handed on to you.
                       Overwhelmed with love and mercy
                       You bend it on your prayerful children:
                       Let each one know what a Mother he prayed!

                       His Marian songs are innumerable, with the most varied and beautiful titles. As a young
               man, in the parish of St. Mary dell'Arco, he founded the pious association of Our Lady of Stella
               Mattutina and he published a booklet of prayers and verses to depict this title.
                       As a child, he used to go to the church of the Madonna della Mercede (Our Lady of
               Ransom), near his home, and this devotion never faded in him.


               3. The Apostle of Mary

                       For several years, every Saturday, the cleric Hannibal preached the glories of the Virgin
               in the Parish Church of San Lorenzo. In 1876, as previously mentioned, he also preached the
               whole  month  of  May,  introducing  the  devotion  of  our  Lady  of  Lourdes  to  the  citizens  of
               Messina, and concluding it with the foundation of a Confraternity and the publication of a
               pamphlet on the Virgin.
                       He studied very well ‘The Glories of Mary’ by St. Alphonsus Liguori, and the twelve
               volumes of the ‘History of the Marian Sanctuaries in the World’ by Vico, thus he never lacked
               solid arguments and examples in his sermons.
                       He used to say, “It is gentle and sweet to speak of her whose name is honeycomb, whose
               venerated images steal our heart, whose divine memory makes us faint with love.”
                       One year, when he started preaching in the month of May, he declared to be happy to
               let loose his tongue with praise of Mary “for whom I would willingly give my blood.”
                       Several volumes of Father Hannibal’s sermons on Our Lady have been kept. Most of
               them are outlines which his faith and love translated into lively and burning words later on. I
               cannot forget what Fr. Nalbone, SJ, said, “I remember an acclamation on the Virgin of the
               Scala. It was a masterpiece, and its charming part was most of all his sense of filial love for
               the Virgin.”

                       Father Hannibal reveals his filial love especially with his confidence in referring to
               Mary.
                       He asked the Virgin for his own conversion: “Mother entirely pure, beautiful, and holy;
               I beg you to inspire in me a holy horror for every fault, however small, and to convert me.
               Convert me to God, convert me to the Blessed Jesus... convert me to the perfect accomplishment
               of his supreme will.”
                       With great fervor, he asked her for the virtues he needed: “My Holy Mother, divine
               teacher of all virtues, I plead you, let me walk the path by which I can reach my sanctification,
               the sanctification of souls and the growth of this pious Work in the Most Holy Heart of Jesus.
               May I come to the desired union of love with my Supreme Good.”
                       For the needs of his Institutions, Father Hannibal found an infallible remedy for having
               recourse to Our Lady. In the very earliest days of his apostolate, he let the crowd of Avignone
               sing to the Most Holy Virgin, Mother of the Poor:

                       We are oppressed and abandoned,
                       We lack food on the table,
                       And our tired life

                       Fades away among worries.
                       Beautiful Mother of the afflicted,
                       Have mercy on us!
                       The wind blows and the storm
                       Pours over our roofs:
                       O Mary, if you do not hurry
                       This winter we will die;
                       Beautiful and true Mother,
                       Have mercy on us!


                       Then, depending on the case, he pleads, “Have mercy on us, O most powerful Empress,
               save us! Tomorrow we have no more bread, no more noodles, and no more income.” Again,
               “Mother of the poor, of the orphans, of the virgins, and of the priests, have mercy on us! All
               the doors are closed: O Door of heavens, open up for us!”
                       Father Hannibal also addressed prayers for vocations to Mary, “Look, Holy Mother,
               how so many poor souls perish because there is no one to save them. Look, Oh Merciful Mother,
               how  innocence  is  wrecked  because  of  the  lack  of  good  laborers  who  cultivate  the  tender
               sprouts.  Mother,  You  are  the  Queen  of  Apostles,  and  from  your  intercession  comes  every
               vocation...”
                       He prayed for the Church, battered by storms, “The Church cannot perish, because your
               Son swore that it will not perish. However, souls perish and Satan devours his prey. Come!
               Break his head. It is enough for you to want it, O Immaculate Mary”.

                       In a prayer, we find the title that later on St. Paul VI solemnly proclaimed and strongly
               recommended: Mary, Mother of the Church.
                       All the graces come through Mary. Father Hannibal wrote, “It is true that when God
               closes, no one opens, as the Sacred Scriptures say; but I think that the Most Holy Virgin Mary



                                                           109]]></page><page Index="110"><![CDATA[is exempt. She opens and closes the door, through which every grace comes to us, as she
               pleases.”
                       Father Di Francia solved his doubts and perplexities through recourse to the Most Holy
               Virgin. He remembered often the verses of the poet Arici dedicated to Our Lady of Good
               Counsel. He insisted that the Superiors especially needed to implore “the divine help in all
               circumstances through the Most Holy Name of Jesus and the enlightenment of the Blessed
               Virgin of Good Counsel.” He says, “The invocation to the Most Holy Virgin of Good Counsel,
               done with love and faith, has proved to be always more effective than we think and opens the
               most rigid minds.”



               4. The ‘Special Identity’ of the Institute

                       The Work of Father Hannibal stands out because of its particular devotion to the Virgin.
               “The greatest devotion to the Mother of God will be the special glory and characteristic of the
               Congregation of the Rogationists... The devotion to the Holy Virgin is a special identification
               mark of this pious Institute” because sanctity is not possible without love for Our Lady. “This
               is the flame of love which forms the Saints, the flame that cannot be separated from the love of
               God and without which no grace can be obtained from the Lord. The tender, profound, and
               gentle love for the Mother of God, Mary Most Holy Immaculate, is the love of all those who
               are predestined [for salvation].”
                       He insisted, “Jesus will then reign in our hearts when the love for the Most Holy Mother
               will permeate them. We cannot love Jesus if we do not love Mary; we cannot reach Jesus if not
               through Mary... Truly, by loving and serving this great Mother, and not otherwise, we come to
               know, love, and possess, in the union of love, the supreme good, Jesus our Lord who shall be
               our ultimate and supreme end. Those who do not seek Mary will not find Jesus. Those who seek
               Mary will find Jesus.”
                       The Marian spirit of the Institute is conveyed at first sight at the entrance of each House
               of Father Hannibal where people are received by the smiling images of the Sacred Heart of
               Jesus and the Heart of Mary. They introduce themselves respectively. “I am the Owner of this
               House and of all those who dwell in it and love me” and “I am the Lady of this House and of
               all those who dwell in it and love me”.
                       All the Marian feasts are always to be celebrated with the greatest fervor and prepared
               with small sacrifices [little flowers], sermons, supplications, and small letters addressed to our
               Lady. The Father prescribed the consecration to the Holy Virgin of Perpetual Help every first
               day of the month, the abstinence from fruits, and the meditation on the Virgin each Saturday.
               Several times during the year, there are vigils to honor Our Lady, for example, for the Child
               Mary, and so on. However, we cannot express the enthusiasm for our Lady that Father Hannibal
               could arouse in the hearts!
                       He wanted the statues and images of the Virgin to be beautiful, holy, and devout in
               order to excite devotion and encourage prayer, recalling truly our Lady, the masterpiece of
               God.
                       He did not fail to express his complaint to an accredited Marian magazine that had
               published a picture of Our Lady which he did not like because “it does not reproduce at all the
               sublimity  and  excellence  of  Mary,  our  great  Lady.  The  facial  features  of  that  picture  had
               nothing sacred or divine; notwithstanding that the artist is famous. In fact, the image, I repeat,
               lacks that aesthetic, which, instead of fostering fervent devotion, seems rather to stifle it. If the
               original is the same, it means that the artist, with all his skills, did something inconclusive.”



                                                           110]]></page><page Index="111"><![CDATA[For  his  Houses,  Father  Hannibal  preferred  the  statue  of  the  Immaculate  sculptured  by
               Cantalamessa, which, with its hands clasped together and its attitude, enraptured him, “See how
               beautiful she is!” - he repeated – “She is the glorified humility!”



               6. His Spiritual Creativity

                       Father Hannibal’s devotion devised “industries” [special activities] to foster the fervor
               and love for Our Lady.
                       On  July  2,  1913,  in  Oria,  he  had  to  inaugurate  one  of  the  statues  carved  by
               Cantalamessa.  The  anticipation  was  fostered  for  a  long  time.  The  image  was  going  to  be
               displayed in front of the community gathered in the courtyard around the box that contained it.
               The altar boys with candles, cross, and a bucket of holy water were ready for the procession as
               well as the excited musicians and singers to greet Our Lady immediately at her first appearance.
                       The Father, wearing surplice and stole, started maneuvering hammer and tongs, helped
               by others. The box was opened; everyone's eyes were pinned to it... What a disappointment!
               The box was empty!
                       Embarrassed, the Father exclaimed, “Oh, the Mystical Dove has flown away; she has
               flown away!” All followed as he went through the garden and into the House, looking into all
               the corners. Finally, we saw a small light at the end of an underground corridor and we heard
               the cooing of doves ... “Here she is! Here she is! The Mystical Dove! ... She has taken refuge
               in the hollow of the stone...” Full of enthusiasm, he proposed a song of invitation:


                       Arise, ethereal Dove,
                       Leave your stony nest,
                       Get out of the rubbles
                       As the sun from the shadow.
                       Don’t you hear the cry
                       Many of your children raise to you,
                       In the holy Tabernacle
                       God your Son awaits for you!

                       How much tenderness for Our Lady! At La Salette, he noticed that the three statues of
               the Most Holy Virgin, representing the three stations, were in the dark! He sent to the Shrine
               three bronze Angels with a lamp in their hands with this inscription, “In the darkness of these
               mountains, the Angels of Messina light up the Queen of the Alps, the Most Holy Virgin of La
               Salette, O Mother of God, the City of your Holy Letter greets you, loves you, and begs your
               mercy!”
                       In Oria, over one of the city gates, he saw a statue of Our Lady completely decapitated
               caused by a cyclone that had occurred twelve years earlier. Immediately, he had a beautiful
               head with flowing hair sculptured. Thus, the Most Holy Lady returned to smile at her faithful.
                       When he found the name of Mary on the threshold of churches and the platform of the
               altars, he arranged to replace them at his own expense. He wrote a circular letter to the Bishops
               for these cases, in order to avoid that the Most Holy Name of Mary is trampled upon.
                       Father Hannibal proclaimed Mary Most Holy as the “absolute, effective, and immediate
               Superior, guide, and teacher of the Rogationists and of the Daughters of Divine Zeal” and he


                                                           111]]></page><page Index="112"><![CDATA[proclaimed the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus as the “absolute, effective, and immediate Superior
               of the two Congregations.”
                       From this proclamation, he expected “miracles of grace, true conversion to Jesus, and
               the acquisition of holy virtues.”
                       In  fact,  he  clearly  warns  his  children,  “The  love  of  the  Most  Holy  Virgin  consists
               particularly in the imitation of her virtues, especially of her humility, purity of soul, strong and
               constant  love  for  our  Lord,  zeal  for  his  glory  and  the  salvation  of  souls,  great  love  and
               gentleness in all the encounters.”


               8. The Slavery of Love


                       The Marian spirit of Father Hannibal and of his Work lies principally in the interior and
               exterior practice of the holy Slavery of Love taught by St. Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort.
                       “This slavery starts with baptism. From slaves of sin, we become slaves of Jesus Christ
               Our Lord. We cannot be such if we do not first make ourselves slaves of love of Mary Most
               Holy. This is the secret! This is the work that the Holy Spirit dictated to St. Louis M. Grignion.
               The purpose of this slavery of love is for Mary Most Holy to make us perfect slaves of Jesus
               Our Lord, so that we may acknowledge Him as Lord and God, serve Him with fidelity, and do
               his adorable will in everything.”
                       Father Hannibal did not ignore the polemics sparked by the word ‘slave’, which made
               the people of our time turn their noses up, being idolaters of freedom without boundaries.
               However, the obstacle can be overcome by putting the accent on love, as the characteristic of
               this slavery, and in the end, it only bonds us closer to Our Lady with filial bonds. The Father
               wrote, “Basing everything on the love of a child and considering myself as a son who, out of
               special love for the Queen Mother, wants to become also her slave; or that the Queen adopts
               the slave as her son, driven by immense love, so that the slave remains a son and a slave.” He
               concludes, “Oh most happy slavery! Thus, we all belong to Jesus and Mary. Jesus and Mary
               will unite us to their divine Hearts and share their graces with us! This sacred slavery is all
               slavery of love, by which we become beloved children of Jesus and Mary more deeply. This
               sacred slavery will make us grow in the knowledge and love of Jesus and Mary, will obtain
               many blessings in life for us, and make us eternally happy if we are faithful and persevering.”
                       St. Louis M. Grignion warns that the one who will reach the final step of this devotion
               and permanently inhabit is “only the person to whom the Spirit of Jesus Christ will unveil this
               secret. This very faithful person will be led by Jesus himself in advancing from virtue to virtue,
               from grace to grace, from light to lights, and thus reach the transformation of himself in Jesus
               Christ, the fullness of his life on earth, and his glory in Heaven.”
                        We believe that Father Hannibal was precisely one of these lucky persons.

                                                        CHARITY






               1. Father Hannibal’s Distinctive Virtue

                       Charity  was  Father  Hannibal’s  distinctive  virtue  that  dominated  the  others,  a
               characteristic of his personality that gave a specific aspect to his apostolate.
                       Fr. Nalbone stated, “He was a saintly priest, forgetful of himself, humble and meek,
               Franciscan in his poverty, with an interior life and singular devotion.”
                        “Charity towards the poor was his characteristic, to the point that in describing a
               charitable man, people used to say, and still say: ‘He is another Canon Di Francia.’”
                       We find repeatedly stated about him, “He was outstanding and unbeatable in charity,
               a hero, a genius of charity.” Thus, he can rightly be put side by side with the great champions
               that enlightened the Church in recent times: Cottolengo, Don Bosco, Fr. Ludovico da Casoria,
               Don Guanella, Don Orione, and Fr. Cusmano.
                       He found joy, happiness, and life in giving and in giving himself.


               2. The Offering of His Life


                       Father Hannibal loved people immensely. “I will esteem people so much that for the
               salvation of just one person, I would consider it worth spending my entire life even if it had to
               consists entirely of sufferings, toil, and sacrifices. I will keep in mind the teachings of the Saints
               that Jesus Christ our Lord loves a single person as much as he loves all the people put together,
               and that if in this world there had been only one person, for this single person, our Lord would
               have suffered and died the same.”
                       The ‘offering of himself’, as he desired to annihilate and destroy himself for the glory
               of God, goes back to May 3, 1880. Feeling desolate, he asked the Lord, “Why is it that I don’t
               know how to love you? Why do not all people love, serve, obey, and please you?” He recognized
               that Messina needed an apostle to transform and regenerate it by “working for the conversion
               of sinners and the sanctification of the just one.” And he moaned from the depths of his heart,
               “Send, send, O Lord, the one you have to send!... From the treasure of your infinite goodness,
               send to Messina a true apostle endowed with your blessings, a pure, chaste, blameless, simple,
               meek, sober, just, and prudent priest. A priest full of Holy Spirit, of mercy, of strength and
               perseverance, full of the knowledge of the Saints and of all ecclesiastical doctrine, to carry on
               his sublime ministry in the most dignified way.” He concluded with this generous offering, “My
               God, if to raise this priest according to your Heart, you want the offering of my life, I offer it
               to you right now... Accept, oh most gentle Lord, this offering of mine; make me disappear from
               the earth and, as my replacement, let this longed for apostle come, this faithful priest who will
               do according to the will of your Heart. Send Lord, the one you have to send!”




                                                           113]]></page><page Index="114"><![CDATA[We can reasonably believe that the request was well-received and that the desired priest,
               the longed-for apostle was… he, himself!


               3. All had Recourse to Father Di Francia

                       Any public work of beneficence was inconceivable in Messina if not connected, in one
               way or another, with the name of Father Di Francia, at least for moral support and for lively
               encouragement, besides the material contributions in the form of generous offerings, which he
               would never fail to grant.
                       Children to catechize, doubtful persons to enlighten, sick people to console, sinners to
               convert, fallen people to lift up, marriages to save: all of these interested Father Hannibal
               immediately. He rushed to these situations either when he was called, or spontaneously offered
               his help.
                       In desperate cases of dying persons who refused the sacraments, people appealed to
               Father Di Francia. He immediately required the orphans to pray, and then rushed to the dying
               person. He had thus great consolations, like the Pharmacist Cananzi and the renowned Jewish
               politician Francesco Faranda who were reconciled with God and were assisted by him until
               their last moments.
                       I remember Senator Ludovico Fulci, a well-known and outstanding member and head
               of  the  masonry  who  did  not  have  his  child  baptized.  One  day,  Father  Hannibal  presented
               himself to the Senator who declared himself honored by the visit of Father Di Francia, saying
               that he was ready to help him with whatever he needed. The Father said right away, “What I
               need now is to baptize your child.” Nothing could be denied to Father Di Francia, and to the
               baptism of the child, Father Hannibal added the legitimacy of the marriage of his parents.

                       When  the  time  came,  Father  Hannibal  wanted  to  prepare  his  godson  for  his  First
               Communion  and  to  accompany  him  to  the  altar  during  the  Mass  that  he  wanted  to  be
               solemnized and celebrated by Fr. Vitale.


               4. Professor Tommaso Cannizzaro


                       Father  Di  Francia  had  frequent  relations  with  and  was  received  with  pleasure  by
               Tommaso Cannizzaro, a poet and writer of Messina. Cannizzaro professed as an atheist. Their
               talks and discussions generally began with the reading of the poems that they shared, then
               continued about religious issues. Cannizzaro’s daughter gave us a copy of Father Hannibal’s
               letter to her father where he explains the divinity of Jesus Christ.

                       Prof. Cannizzaro said he recognized Jesus Christ as a sublime child of Mary. Father Di
               Francia replied, “From where did you get the knowledge of Jesus Christ as a sublime man who
               drove away the Pharisees, consoled the afflicted, and so on? Certainly from the Gospels. Well,
               the Holy Gospels are full of the divinity of Jesus Christ... The evangelists present him to us
               throughout his life as Man and as God. He was born as a child in the grotto: this is as Man.
               The Angels came down to the grotto and sung, and an Angel announced him to the shepherds
               by telling them, ‘I give you news of immense joy. The Savior of the world is born.’: this is as
               God. At thirty, he entered Jerusalem, preached, and consoled the afflicted: this is as Man. He
               worked wonderful miracles, multiplying the bread, and so on: this is as God. The Jews insulted
               him and he kept silent: this is as Man. His disciples, with just the name of Jesus, cast out
               demons and healed the sick: this is as God.”

               brightly and splendidly into your mind and your heart, and enkindle it with the beautiful flame
               of the divine love for Jesus Christ, true Man and true God. May this light and flame be such
               that your conversion to the true faith be entire, complete, perfect, universal, so that faith may
               free you from eternal perdition and lead you to eternal salvation.”
                       During one of Father Hannibal’s absences from Messina, the Professor died reconciled
               with God. The prayers of the Father had not been in vain.


               5.  Letter to His Friends

                       Prof. Cannizzaro was “a man of great natural goodness, righteousness, and incapable
               of offending anyone,” as Father Di Francia wrote. The Father wanted to extend his thoughts to
               many other people who, in matters of religion, considered themselves ‘atheists’ or ‘agnostics’
               but would not reject a good word, and not close their minds and hearts to the revealed truth.
               They could practically be won over to God through His grace if they could find a sincere friend
               taking interest in them.
                       From this came his “Letter to the Friends”, a pamphlet he printed to explain simply and
               clearly the truths of the Christian doctrine, and to invite his readers to think seriously about
               their salvation as the ultimate goal of life.
                       Father Hannibal addressed the pamphlet “to his friends and gentlemen whom he loves
               as he loves himself, and whose welfare and happiness he desires as that of himself.” Turning
               to  a  specific  addressee,  he  explains,  “I  composed  this  letter  for  persons  who,  through  my
               personal acquaintances or through others or through their fame, I knew to be endowed with
               admirable qualities of mind and heart. It seemed to me that they are the people best disposed
               to  receive  the  wholesome  expressions  of  my  heart,  with  the  pure  impartiality  of  the  most
               righteous reason.”
                       The letter was sent to all the intellectuals of Messina, even to foreigners and to circles
               hostile  or  indifferent  to  religious  matters.  We  know  that  it  was  received  everywhere  with
               respect and, may the good Lord will it, with satisfying results.


               6. His Supreme Interest: The Salvation of People

                       Before  anything  else,  Father  Hannibal  always  established  the  arguments  of  faith
               because for him the salvation of people was the supreme interest.
                       In 1923, when for the first time a ‘Beauty Contest’ was announced in Messina, he
               published a fiery protest in the newspaper ‘La Scintilla’. The article ended with the vigorous
               reminder that “the very strict account that we have to give of all our actions, from now to the
               short end of our life, to that supreme judge who said that it is better to tie a millstone to our
               necks than to be the cause of scandal for the innocent! After the harsh passage through this
               world, for those who observed the divine law and practiced the holy religion of Jesus Christ,
               there will be the encounter with a happy eternity. For those instead, who lived detached from
               God and their religious duties, there will be a very unhappy eternity and, in a moment, as the
               Gospel says, they will fall into hell.”

                       Giving and self-giving was the life of Father Hannibal, not only for the spiritual but
               also for the material necessities of his neighbors.
                       He wrote, “Let the Rogationists remember that our Pious Work was born with the holy
               mission of giving and that the more we give, the more the Lord will give us, since, he said,
               ‘Give one, and you will receive a hundredfold, and you will have eternal life, besides.’”
                       He taught, “If on one hand, we must seek the means of subsistence for us and for the
               Works, on the other hand, we must pay homage to the word of the Divine Redeemer, ‘There is
               more happiness in giving than in receiving’ (Acts 20:35). This faith in the words of Jesus Christ
               will make us remember what he Himself declared, ‘Whatever you did to one of these little ones,
               you did it to me’ (Mt 25: 40).”
                       These divine words represent the program of Father Hannibal’s life. He always wanted
               to distribute everything: bread, money, and clothes. When he had nothing left to give, he would
               give a smile, a good word, and the hope of a gift to give the day after. Thus, he made all feel
               his pain for not being able to give immediately, and he felt mortified.
                       In his Houses, the soup for the poor had to be ready every day. No poor was to be
               dismissed without receiving help. Once, upon learning that a Mother Superior had dismissed a
               poor with empty hands because the House was still in its beginnings and there was absolutely
               nothing to give, he did not accept this as an excuse. He set a ‘Novena of Charity’, an extra help
               for nine days for all the poor who came to the door, and, upon learning about it, for those nine
               days the poor were plentiful.
                       What he wrote of himself with simplicity is true literally: “I would like to have a bond
               of friendship with everyone on earth, rich and poor, masters and laborers, humble and poor
               people or aristocrats. I have seen a brother and a lord in each of them, and the best I desired
               for myself in this life or in the next, I desired equally for all.”
                       His  heart  was  immense.  The  sufferings  of  all  would  find  the  echo  of  effective
               compassion in his immense heart and the tears of all the sufferings dropped warm into his heart
               caused a river of charity, which kept on widening its banks and continued even with a fuller
               and  more  fruitful  abundance.  Broken  families,  unemployed  workers,  endangered  youth,
               students with no possibility of continuing their studies for lack of means, any kind of afflicted
               persons, people persecuted by misfortunes without a name and a shelter: all had recourse to
               him, and he placed all his time at their disposal. All found a consoler and a father in him.



               8. Concern for Priests and Religious

                       He had more than paternal tenderness for poor priests and needy communities.
                       He wrote for his followers, “You cannot help feeling moved and extend your hand
               towards those who belong to our Lord Jesus Christ, with unlimited confidence in the divine
               promise. Just read the words of the prophet Malachi (3:10ff, RSV), ‘Bring the full tithes into
               the storehouse, that there may be food in my house, and thereby put me to the test,’ says the
               Lord of hosts, ‘if I will not open the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you an
               overflowing blessing.  I will rebuke the devourer for you so that it will not destroy the fruits of
               your soil (that is, I will put to flight the insects that devour the crops, such as the worms, the
               locusts, etc.) and the vine in your field shall not fail to bear,’ says the Lord of hosts. ‘Then, all
               the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight.’”



                                                           116]]></page><page Index="117"><![CDATA[9. A Strange Behavior

                       Father Hannibal used to behave following these principles, and this is how he justified
               himself when Mons. Francesco Parrillo, the Apostolic Visitor, requested an explanation from
               him. “I have to reveal to Your Reverence, who represents for us the Supreme Authority, a
               somehow strange behavior, as I behaved during the more than forty years that I have been in
               the field of charitable works.
                       “I had great concern for the orphans and the poor, and this is good. However, I also
               had a belief in desiring to give, not only for the Institutions I started but also for the worthy
               institutions created by others, and not only for the people I assisted in my Institutes but also
               for poor beggars and Religious Houses. I put my trust to that divine Word: ‘give one and you
               will receive a hundredfold,’ and the other, ‘give, and it will be given to you; good measure,
               pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap.’ I consider ‘giving’ as
               the infallible secret of continuous Providence.
                       “Thus, my hope in God was never disappointed. With his infinite goodness, our Lord
               overflows us with the superabundance of his divine Providence from every side. I have to state
               that indeed my donations in relation to our Institutes and the people I sheltered in them could
               not be considered thoughtless because, first of all, by God’s grace, I never let those sheltered
               in my Institute lack in anything. Therefore, it is on today’s abundance that we tried to make
               investments with the Bank of the Divine Providence, without worrying for tomorrow.
                       “I closed my eyes especially when I had to help Religious Sisters and their Houses.
               Shall I say it? I will tell you in strict confidentiality: to an impoverished monastery in Naples
               named  ‘Sisters  of  Stella  Mattutina’  (Sisters  of  the  Morning  Star)  I  gave  120,000  Lire.  To
               several Salesian monasteries of St. Francis de Sales in Italy and some in France, we made
               monthly donations summing up to several thousand Lire. The Salesian Sisters of Bologna, for
               the  grave  situation  in  which  they  were,  received  from  us  30,000  Lire.  The  Claretians,
               Carmelites, and Dominican Sisters receive from us monthly allowances given the sorrowful
                                                                                                   13
               times in which the cloistered nuns perish and they are the true victims of this century.”
                       This  was  the  way  Father  Hannibal  acted  and  thought;  and  the  ‘strangeness’  and
               ‘presumption’ of which he humbly accuses himself did not bring any condemnation to him.
                       Instead, the people of Messina understood him and named him with a title perfectly
               consistent  with  his  nature:  ‘Father  of  the  Orphans  and  the  Poor’.  We  cannot  forget  the
               meaningful word from the lips of a commoner at the death of Father Hannibal, “The mouth that
               never said ‘no’ is now closed.”



















                  13  To understand the real value of these donations, bear in mind the value of Lire during Father Hannibal’s
               time. (TN. 10 Lire of 1890 would correspond to 42.35 Euros today).

                                                      ANECDOTES





               1. She is Only Three, and They Made Her Cry!

                       Here are some stories that reveal the tenderness of Father Hannibal’s heart.
                       In the orphanage of Taormina, the Father found a little girl desperately crying. He
               stopped to look at her, was moved, and cried. The Father learned from the Sister that the girl
               did not want to drink the milk.
                       “Oh let it go! Let it go! Why do you make her cry like this?”
                       Then he took the little girl by the hand and led her to his room, repeating in a sorrowful
               voice, “My poor little daughter, they made you sad; they made you cry at three!”
                       He brought the child back to the Sister only after a genuine smile had returned to the
               lips of the innocent.


               2. Am I Not your Father?

                       Again in Taormina, once, two young girls of the orphanage felt especially the burden
               of their misfortune. They were never called to the parlor or received gifts because they had no
               relatives.
                       Father Hannibal sent a gift to each of them with the card, “Your Father is waiting for
               you in the parlor.”
                       They found him in the parlor. He received them with the sweetest smile. Since the girls
               were surprised, he asked, “Why? Am I not your father?””


               3. The Lord Will Not Let Us Go Hungry


                       In Oria, a poor man showed up and Father Hannibal happened to open the door. He
               went to the refectory and, as he could not find anything else, he collected the bread on the tables
               and brought it to the poor fellow.
                       The servant objected, “Father, it is already lunchtime and there is no bread for the
               community.”
                       “The Lord will certainly provide. He will not leave us hungry...”
                       While the church’s bells rang the Angelus, a woman came to the door with a large
               basket of bread steaming hot. She just wanted one loaf back, blessed by Father Hannibal. The
               remaining bread was for the children.

                       On a winter evening in 1915, Fr. Vitale arrived at a late hour in Reggio, the city on the
               other side of the Strait, almost in front of Messina. It was wartime and very dark, and the rain
               was pouring. A porter picked up his luggage and offered to accompany him to a safe hotel, but
               it was hard to find any accommodation.
                       On hearing the story, the Father asked, “How much did you give to that poor man?”
                       “Two Lire, Father.” Those were difficult times and the porter was happy with that tip.
                       “Too little, too little!” remarked the Father. “Do you know his name?”
                       “Vito Morabito, he told me.”
                       Father Hannibal wrote in his notebook, ‘Vito Morabito’, and added, “When I get to
               Reggio, I will look for him at the station and compensate him.”
                       We are sure that the man got his reward. The Father never forgot these things.


               5. The Waterman

                       One day, a water deliverer slipped, broke his barrel, got a bleeding foot, and started
               swearing.
                       Father Hannibal rebuked him, threatening the divine punishment. The poor man was
               confused  and  asked  for  forgiveness.  Then,  the  Father  dried  the  man’s  wound  with  his
               handkerchief,  accompanied  him  to  the  nearby  Frasti  Pharmacy  for  medication,  and  upon
               learning that the cost of the barrel was 5 Lire, gave him 25 to buy two barrels and to keep the
               rest for the time he remained without work.


               6. This Poor Man Will Have Something to Eat


                       One time the Father returned accompanied by a man who carried a large wicker basket
               full of fruits, definitely not of the best quality.
                       “What are we going to do with these spoiled fruits?” asked the Bursar.

                       “My blessed son, that man has to live somehow. Who would buy this stuff? We will
               throw away the rotten ones, but the poor man will have something to eat.”



               7. We Will Force the Providence

                       In times of lack of means, it was necessary to increase charity. It was the sure way to
               come out of it happily.

                       One day the Father presented a young unemployed person to be accepted for a job.
                       “Father, you know very well that we have no money. How will we cover the expense?”
                       “We must take this poor man precisely for this: by doing charity we will force Divine
               Providence to come to our aid.”






                                                           119]]></page><page Index="120"><![CDATA[8. “See the Miracles of Providence”

                       On a trip to Rome with Fr. Carmelo, who was still a student at that time, Father Hannibal
               asked him how much he had.
                       “One hundred Lire, Father.”
                       “It’s too little. However, give them to me.”
                       It was useless to protest that at least fifty was needed for the return ticket... The Father
               asked for all of it, placed them into an envelope and gave them to a poor priest that he had seen
               in the other compartment.
                       Meanwhile, a man asked Fr. Carmelo who the other priest with him was. Upon hearing
               that it was Father Di Francia, he rejoiced at having met a priest of whom he had heard people
               talking about so well and, when the Father returned to his seat, he went to greet him and gave
               him an envelope.
                       There was one thousand Lire inside the envelope. The Father remarked to the young
               Carmelo, “Do you see the miracles of the Providence? Had we given fifty Lire, we would have
               received only five hundred. We gave one hundred and the Lord sent us one thousand.”


               9. The Three Capuchins

                       On a winter evening, three Capuchin Fathers alighted at the Oria station from the last
               train trip of that day. They met our Brother Giuseppe Antonio Meli who heard them talking of
               going to the Seminary for accommodation.
                       When Father Hannibal learned about it, he rebuked the Brother for not having offered
               them hospitality in our House and asked him to go, despite of the late hour and pouring rain,
               equipped with a lamp, to look for them and to invite them.  Brother Guiseppe found them at
               the front gate of the Seminary, which at that hour of the night would never open.
                       Those good Fathers accepted the invitation. First, Father Hannibal apologized, then he
               had warm water ready to wash their feet. He went to look for blankets so that they would not
               suffer because it was cold; and because there were not enough blankets in the House, he gave
               them his own.


               10. I Did Not Want to Leave Without Blessing You


                       In October 1926, Father Hannibal was in Oria. He felt that his end was nearing. He did
               not have the strength to walk up to the Sisters’ House in San Benedetto. He invited the Sisters
               to come down to San Pasquale, the male House, to receive his blessing.
                       As  the  community  was  lining  up  in  front  of  him,  he  asked  solicitously,  “Where  is
               Sammeri?”
                       Sammeri was a former orphan girl who, after finishing her education, did not want to
               leave the Institute, and had remained there as a daughter [guest-helper] of the House. The
               Father could not forget her whom he considered as his daughter. They told him that she could
               not come because of her corns [calluses], which afflicted her. He sent a carriage right away to
               pick her up.
                       When she arrived, he said, “My dear, I will never come anymore to Oria, and I did not
               want to leave without giving you my blessing. As for the corns, recommend yourself to St.

               11. The Sheep for the Butcher

                       Father Hannibal had a sheep in the garden given by a benefactor. A poor man came to
               the entrance asking alms for himself and his family. There was no bread... and the Father’s
               pockets were completely empty!
                       “What is the job of this man?”
                       “He is a butcher, Father.”
                       His face lit up as a bright idea flashed in his mind:
                       “Very well then. Give him the sheep. We couldn’t use it more conveniently.”


               12.  Switching of Dishes


                       One day, the Father ordered a sumptuous meal.
                       At the set time, the guests entered. They were the dregs of mankind, a rabble of poor
               ragged men who were the marquises and princes for Father Hannibal’s great faith.
                       He  sat  happily  among  them  and  the  feast  begun.  The  man  on  his  side  was  less
               acquainted with cleanliness and hygiene than the other men, thus he soiled the dish of noodles
               with the drippings from his mouth and nose. In an instant, the Father traded his dish with that
               of the poor man. The Sister, who was serving, noticed it and stifled a cry of horror. However,
               a glance of the Father imposed silence and he finished the dish with particular relish.



               13. Uncle Giacomo

                       An old servant, uncle Giacomo, had worked for many years in the House of Oria. At
               that time, he was going around leaning on a knotty club that he had found, but it did not give
               him the proper support.
                       Father Hannibal said, “Poor old man, that is not good. It’s not good.”
                       The next time he came home, the Father brought a wonderful deluxe cane with a bent
               and comfortable handle and rushed directly to uncle Giacomo with a little bag of candies.
               “Uncle Giacomo, take everything. I chose the cane especially for you.”



               14. The Poor are Our Masters

                       The  Father  got  off  at  the  train  station  and  was  returning  home  on  the  orphanage’s
               carriage: a humble couch, drawn by a humble horse, guided by an unassuming Religious.
                       Together with the Father were a coadjutor Brother and a Sister. It was around noon.

                       As they were approaching the Institute, the Father continued to look out of the window
               generously giving bows and salutations. The Sister could not find an explanation for those
               cordial greetings and was thinking, “The Father surely has many friends in this town! However,


                                                           121]]></page><page Index="122"><![CDATA[is it possible that they are all gathering here at this time?” Thus, at the first opportunity, she
               peeped out and was astounded to see a crowd of dirty and ragged poor men, coming back from
               the orphanage where they had just received their daily soup.

                       Father Hannibal perceived immediately the Sister’s thought and said “My daughter, do
               not wonder if I greet them: are not the poor our masters?”



               15. The Flock of Sparrows

                       Another episode is worthy of St. Francis’ ‘Little Flowers’.
                       The snow had fallen in abundance and, from behind his window pane, the Father was
               watching a flock of sparrows, vainly searching for birdseed over that white blanket.
                       “Poor little birds, they too are creatures of God!”
                       He summoned one of the Brothers. “Brother, bring some crumbs to feed these little
               creatures.” The Brother came back with an abundant supply.
                       The  Father  added,  “This  is  not  enough.  The  crumbs  will  sink  into  the  snow  and
               disappear.”

                       They had to look for a plank and lay the birds’ banquet over it. Then, the sparrows
               feasted for God’s praise.



               16. How Could I Say No to Father Di Francia

                       A postal worker had been fired for opening the letters and for stealing, which were done
               against Father Hannibal. Several days after, the Provincial Director [of the Post Office] had the
               man  rehired  and  his  dismissal  files  thrown  into  the  wastebasket.  To  those  who  expressed
               surprise, he confided, “I couldn’t do otherwise. Last night, Father Di Francia came to see me,
               and knelt in front of me, pleading for the case of the disgraced man who has a wife and children
               and so on. ‘I have forgiven him and you must do the same’! He also said that he would remain
               kneeling as long as I did not give in to his request. How could I say no to Father Di Francia?”



               17. They Do Not Have the Courage to Come to Me…

                       One winter evening, Knight Musicò met Father Hannibal, walking on the street together
               with Brother Mariantonio, both loaded with things they were hiding under their mantle.
                       Musicò inquired, “Father, what are you doing on the road at this time, in this cold and
               rain?”
                       “You cannot think of cold and rain when in this block a family dying from hunger... they
               don’t dare to come to me. So, I have to go to them.”


               18. The End of the Swearer


                       At the train station of Oria, one day, Father Hannibal met an operator who, blind with
               rage, was swearing like a trooper.

                       “I lost my wallet with 50 Lire...”
                       The Father did not notice or pretended not to notice the trick. The worker wanted to
               take advantage of his well-known generosity.
                       “Well, here is your 50 Lire but stop swearing if you want to escape God’s punishment.”
                       The swearer took the money but did not care to amend his ways. One day, not too long
               after, unfortunately, he was crushed to death between the bumpers of a train.


               19. A Mosquito Net for the Little Girl

                       Once, in the orphanage of Taormina, the Father noticed that one of the little girls was pale.
                       “Do you feel sick?” he asked.

                       “Father, I cannot sleep at night because of the mosquitoes.”
                       Father Hannibal called the Sister in charge of the orphans, told her to get the mosquito
               net prepared for him and to place it over the bed of the girl.

                       Then, he admonished the Sister, “Be vigilant in asking the educators an account of the
               girls’ health.”
                       He  concluded  repeating,  “The  smallest  of  the  little  orphan  is  worth  more  than  the
               Founder and the Mother General.”


               20. The Shoes for Tommaso


                       Among the poor who frequently came begging at the San Pasquale convent in Oria, we
               remember one named Tommaso, almost reduced to blindness more because of his poor hygiene
               than from a real illness.
                       One day, Father Hannibal had him cleaned and clothed anew. Only the shoes were
               lacking.  He ordered a search among the several pairs kept in the storeroom.
                       The keeper, Saro Marchese, tried them all on Tommaso but none fit. He went back to
               the Father to report it. The Father told him:
                       “Go to the Church and say three Our Fathers, three Hail Marys, and three Glory Bes
               to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, and you will find the shoes.”
                       They recited the prayers, but the result was negative: the shoes were all too small.
               Marchese went back to the Father who sent him again to pray with faith...
                       Marchese muttered, “Prayers are alright, yes, but there are no shoes that fit him...”
               Discouraged and a bit agitated, he returned to the Father for the third or fourth time.
                       The Father said, “Come with me!” They went together to the Chapel to pray again, then
               back to the storeroom, where Tommaso was still waiting. Father Hannibal looked at the pile of
               shoes and pointed to a pair, “Wear these!”
                       The shoes seemed custom made for Tommaso!
                       Marchese concluded, “I left the Father and cried...”

                                          TOWARDS THE HOMELAND





               1. The Longtime Dream: a House in Rome

                       Towards the end of Father Hannibal’s life, the Lord wanted to crown his longtime
               dream: to open an Institute in Rome.
                       He had tried repeatedly but for one reason or another, the result was always negative.
               However,  he  never  gave  up.  Rome  remained  his  goal.  He  wrote,  “This  is  not  for  human
               ambition; may God spare us! - but to be able to raise the banner of that forgotten command of
               our Lord Jesus Christ: ‘Pray, therefore, the Lord of the Harvest to send out laborers into his
               harvest (Rogate…). To raise it, I say, in the eternal city, which is the center of the Catholic
               faith,  where  the  Supreme  Pontiff,  the  infallible  Vicar  of  Christ  is,  and  where  the  entire
               evangelical doctrine is deposited. Besides, according to the meaningful words of the Holy
               Father Benedict XV, whose memory be blessed, when I knelt at his feet: ‘It is the Supreme
               Pontiff himself who, more than anyone else, must take interest in this great command given by
               our Lord Jesus Christ.”
                       We can see how his passion, the fixed idea, and the star of Father Hannibal’s life was
               always the Rogate!

                       In October 1924, he was able to purchase a suitable building with a wide expanse of
               land, outside Porta San Giovanni, in the Appio neighborhood, on Circonvallazione Street. The
               negotiations for the contract, a complex of exceptional efforts for the renovation of the place,
               and, additionally, his dwelling in a damp environment during the cold winter of 1924, shook
               his body, worn out more by the flames of zeal than by age. He remained in bed for forty days
               and was only able to return to Messina, entirely worn out, on December 15.
                       On January 20, 1925, when Messina celebrated the feast of Blessed Eustochio, and the
               little orphan girls went to the Church to pray for the recovery of the Father, he began to recover,
               so that soon, he was able to resume his activities and travels to the Italian mainland.
                       He prepared the special issue of “God and Neighbor” for the opening of the House of
               Rome, which he inaugurated on the morning of May 24, the day of “Mary Help of Christians,”
               consecrating the House to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Most Holy Virgin, and presenting
               to the Holy Hearts the first orphan boy. That foundation thus started as a male orphanage, run
               by the Daughters of the Divine Zeal.
                       However, by then the Father was already weak. He never recovered but, up to the last
               moment, he did not want to abandon his activities, his Works, and orphans. They remained the
               constant  thought  and  worry  of  his  days,  and  whenever  there  was  anything  concerning  the
               salvation of people, he always found new energy in the flames of his zeal.

               2. Now Let Your Servant Go in Peace!

                       The year 1926 was for Father Hannibal the year of the Divine Mercy towards his Work:
               the two religious Congregations of the Rogationists and of the Daughters of Divine Zeal finally
               received the canonical approval.

               by the Holy See to inspect the Institutes, arrived in Messina. He had biases against the Father’s
               Work, and it seemed that his objections did not disappear after his visit. However, after talking
               with Father Hannibal, whose appearance, attitude, and spirit left a deep impression on him, he
               had a sleepless and tormented night...
                       When,  on  the  following  day,  Fr.  Vitale  went  to  see  him  for  some  explanation,  the
               Monsignor opened fully and honestly his heart. Previously, he had thought of suppressing the
               Institutions, but now he was convinced that in so doing he would go against the will of God.
               “Last night, I was unable to close my eyes. I had in front of me the figure of a holy man saying
               to me, ‘God is with me!’ I reviewed in my mind what I had seen and heard, the words of this
               man of God, the right purpose, and the way of life of his Works, and I felt an inner voice that
               reproached me for my intentions. I had to convince myself that I was wrong and that I had in
               front of me a holy Work which the Lord wants and which must be helped at any cost.”
                       Upon returning to Rome, he worked actively on the processing of the necessary steps
               so that the Archbishop of Messina, Mons. Angelo Paino, on August 6, 1926, the Fast of the
               Transfiguration  of  Our  Lord  and  first  Friday  of  the  month,  could  issue  the  two  decrees
               establishing the two religious Congregations and approving their Rules.

                       In 1910, in a letter to Fr. Palma, Father Hannibal had written, “I pray God to enable me
               to say, ‘Now let your servant go in peace’ [nunc dimittis...] when I will see the small plant
               blossom, becoming well-rooted and giving fruits. Let us trust the Most Gentle Heart of Jesus,
               our Supreme Good, His Holy Mother, and our dear Angels and Saints. Meanwhile, whatever
               we can do, let us do it in the Holy Name of Jesus!”
                       He had done all he could and thus had arrived at the nunc dimittis...

                       Also in that year, he had made his customary visit to the Houses. The news of the
               canonical approval reached him in Trani, where after some days, on August 15, the Feast of
               Our Lady’s Assumption, the Lord imposed on him another sacrifice with the death of one of
               the first and most faithful Sisters, Maria Carmela D’Amore. He assisted her in her illness and
               for her funeral made a wonderful eulogy that was later printed.
                       Then he reached Rome, went back to Oria, and on October 15, returned to Messina.


               3. His Last Illness

                       On the morning of January 24, 1927, the Father did not get up from his bed. That night,
               his illness had started to agonize him and the alternating changes in his health brought him to
               the end.
                       On February 20, the ‘Sexagesima Sunday’, he celebrated the Holy Mass for the last
               time. From that day on, he had to content himself with the Holy Communion. It was a very
               great sacrifice for him, but he consoled himself saying, “I want to do God’s will. The Lord’s
               will is above all things, even the Holy Mass.”
                       On  March  15,  Tuesday,  he  asked  for  the  Anointment  of  the  Sick,  which  was
               administered to him, according to his desire, by Fr. Ernesto Fochesato, a Camillian. He thought
               of securing the particular protection of St. Camillus for his own final hour.

                       Don Orione, upon learning of the Father’s illness, on March 16, sent him “a telegram
               full of brotherly love”, to which Father Hannibal responded “as his heart dictated.” The next
               day,  he  gave  him  an  account  of  his  condition,  “I  became  unable  to  read,  write,  and  to
               concentrate. By night and by day I am in between life and death. I want only what Jesus wants.

               sufferings like me who do not have the means and assistance that I have.”
                       Some days later, on April 11, upon receiving from Don Orione the assurance of prayers
               on the tomb of the St. Anthony of Padua for his healing, the Father answered with this short
               letter, which is a sort of farewell to the friend of his heart and seals his entire epistolary. “A
               thousand thanks for recommending me to our glorious St. Anthony. My condition is severe, but
               the great Saint is very powerful. I feel like a destroyed man. I am extremely weak and need
               extreme effort even to eat. Interior condition: spiritual desolations! However, first, let God’s
               will be done in me [fiat in me voluntas Dei], and may my Jesus’ love consume me!”
                       Meanwhile, even amidst desolations, his spirit united ever more intimately with our
               Lord. “Thanks be to God! Thanks be to God!” he always repeated, especially in his pains and
               adversities, which never lessened until his last moments. “Let the adorable will of God be
               always done!”



               4. Your Will be Done, Lord!

                       His nurse wrote about him, “He liked to listen to readings inducing him to desire this
               gentle submission, and he used to say, ‘That’s it, even my illness is God’s will. He is keeping
               vigil over me. I am pressured by the Divine Will, and He tightens and loosens my sufferings at
               will. Lord, let your will be done, on earth as in heaven”. At times, he prayed, “I am sure of
               your will, I know that my destiny has been decreed, however, my Lord, I am asking with fervor
               for my healing, because the obedience to my superiors imposes it on me.”
                       He certainly earned the reward for obedience, but the Lord wanted the sacrifice.
                       How many lessons we received from his virtue in those terrible days! He told me one
               day, “Son, I ask the Lord never to let you suffer as I am suffering now!” Another time, “How
               much I am suffering! Our Lord suffers every time He sees his chosen ones suffering. However,
               I tell Jesus, ‘This is nothing, Jesus, this is nothing! I don’t want you to suffer for me.”. He stated
               again, “How visible is the effect of the prayers being offered for me! At times my sufferings are
               so sharp, but I feel great strength in me, and all comes from our Lord!”


               5. Death is Changed into Life!

                       He loved the Holy Child Mary with a very singular love. He had written: “How beautiful
               you are, my heavenly little Child, with the smile blossoming on your lips! Could I kneel by that
               cradle, kiss the edge of the blanket covering you, and die because of love at the sparkle of those
               purest eyes!”
                       His devotion found many brilliant initiatives to honor her.
                       According  to  a  pious  belief,  the  Virgin  entered  the  temple  of  Jerusalem  at  three,
               remained there for twelve years, and then married St. Joseph.
                       Father Hannibal built a small Chapel in the House of Taormina to represent the temple
               in Jerusalem, where the heavenly Child was growing up year after year. The Sisters represented
               the Hebrew girls of the temple who had to serve this sublime Lady, Mother, and Mistress.
               November 21 was for Father Hannibal a fixed appointment. He would leave the place where
               he was, so as not to miss the appointment with his Most Holy Lady. When the Virgin reached
               her fifteenth birthday, the Father celebrated her wedding to St. Joseph, and there was a feast,

               of so many famous personages, was and is still called ‘The Room of the Divine Superior’.
                       Now that her faithful servant was approaching the end of his earthly exile, the gentle
               little Child wanted to give him a sign of her appreciation for the veneration he had for her.
                       One morning, some days before his death, the Father’s face brightened suddenly as he
               glanced at a spot in the room... enraptured, exclaiming:  Brother, look! See how beautiful the
               Child Mary is!” The Father remained absorbed in that sweet vision.
                       In this way, the Father’s prayer to Our Lady found its answer:

                       In that hour without respite,

                       When everything disappears,
                       Change then the terrible agony
                       In Your loving presence, O my Mother!

                       The earthly days of Father Hannibal was coming to its end. On the evening of May 31,
               after reciting the last prayers with the help of Brother Michelino Lapelosa, the Father blessed
               him and went to bed. He spent some hours with increasing breathing difficulty and visibly
               suffering. Suddenly a quiver shook the bed: Brother Michelino went closer and called, “Father!
               Father!”
                       The Father did not answer. He was already in agony, and this lasted the whole night.
               Fr. Vitale came and started immediately the prayers for the dying, with the Religious and the
               Sisters. At 6:00 AM, Fr. Gandolfo celebrated the Mass for the agonizing. At 6:30 AM on June
               1, 1927, Wednesday of the Octave of the Ascension, the good and faithful servant, Father
               Hannibal Mary Di Francia, passed to his eternal rest.
                       Watched over by our Lady, Father Hannibal had also sung this:

                       The day of passing away is hastening,
                       I sense the touches of death...
                       Who watches over me? Oh, the Beloved

                       Of my heart closes my eyes!
                       Let no one tell me at that moment:
                       ‘He is dying, he is already gone!’
                       With Mary here in the heart
                       Death has changed into life!

                       We can piously believe that he already enjoys this full, blessed life in the bosom of
               God.


               6. The Funeral

                       The news of his death spread like lightning. Crowds came rushing from the city and
               from the countryside to see ‘the sleeping Saint’.

               announcing, “The ‘city mourns the death of Canon Di Francia’ and an endless river of people
               flowed to the church to venerate the Father’s remains.

                       The Archbishop of Messina, Mons. Angelo Paino, in his announcement, wrote, “We
               express our sorrow for the very sad news that had fallen upon us: Canon Hannibal Mary Di
               Francia is no longer with us! The liveliest flame of Christian charity that has enlightened the
               earth for so many years has ceased to burn. The priest of God, disdainful of worldly comforts,
               consumed only by the zeal for souls, has flown to heaven loaded with merits, carrying in his
               heart the love for his orphans, for his suffering people, for an ever brighter and more Christian
               future for his Messina.”
                       The Vice Mayor reminded the citizens, “Father Di Francia spent his entire life and
               properties to relieve the human sufferings; with Christian humility and with a sublime spirit of
               humanity, he realized and established magnificent works for the public welfare; for fifty years
               he knocked at every door to gather the flower of charity. He was a man whose whole existence
               was a mission and a continuous sacrifice; such a man does not disappear without leaving a
               deep furrow, a bright track of gratitude, and unanimous veneration in the city.”
                       Messina experienced in those days the profound and intimate depth of this mourning.
               “L’Osservatore Romano” the official daily of the Holy See wrote, “Messina cried as she has
               never done before.”
                       On  Saturday,  June  4,  the  funeral  was  a  triumph  with  the  participation  of  all  the
               associations, schools and Religious Orders of Messina, with the entire Seminary, the Chapter
               of Canons headed by the Archbishop, and civil and military authorities; an impressive two-
               kilometer-long  funeral  procession,  and  then  an  enormous,  overflowing  crowd.  The  entire
               Messina was there reverent and moved, with her 200,000 inhabitants, scattered along the roads
               where the funeral passed, to say farewell to her great son.
                       We recall the words written twenty-five years before, by the priest Fr. Silvio Cucinotta,
               about the military carts used for the beneficence walks, “Someday another cart will carry
               Father Hannibal’s remains...then from the balconies, verandas, and terraces, roses, and lilies
               will rain down in the triumph of the hour....”

                                                  (of the English edition)

                       At the time of Father Hannibal’s death, the community of the Rogationists was very
               small, and the Daughters of Divine Zeal were about three hundred.

                       After his death, they grew and expanded, following the footsteps of their Founder. Their
               charism is rooted on the divine words of Jesus, “The harvest is great, but the laborers are few;
               pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest so that he may send laborers in his harvest.”
                       They put into practice this command of the Lord by praying daily for priestly, religious,
               and lay vocations, and spreading this prayer all over the world through the ‘Priestly Alliance
               for Vocations’ and the ‘Union of Prayer for Vocations’. Several “Rogate Vocation Centers”
               and magazines support this work for vocations. However, in line with the spirit of Father
               Hannibal, their prayer also becomes human promotion and evangelization in educating the little
               ones, especially the poor and the orphans through boarding houses, schools, vocational centers,
               and other social and charitable activities.

                       As of 2019, the Rogationists and Daughters of Divine Zeal are present in many parts of
               the world, and everywhere they bring the same spirit of love for ‘God and neighbor’ according
               to the teachings of their Founder.
                       They have expanded to Brazil, the United States, Spain, the Philippines, Argentina,
               Rwanda,  India,  Poland,  Albania,  Cameroon,  Paraguay,  South  Korea,  Bolivia,  Papua  New
               Guinea,  Vietnam,  Indonesia,  Colombia,  Angola,  Mexico,  Sri  Lanka,  Portugal,  Germany,
               England, Colombia, Australia, and Canada.
                       Their main activities in these nations are:
                            - prayer for good laborers to the Lord’s Harvest; they raise their daily personal
                     and community prayer for this purpose, invite people to pray and spread this spirit of
                     prayer with all their means;
                            - Vocation orientation initiatives and campaigns, Vocation Discernment Centers,
                     Rogate  Spirituality  Centers  (Retreat  Houses),  Pastoral  Institutes  for  Vocation
                     Formation;

                            - Seminaries, Postulancy Centers, Novitiates, Theology Centers of Studies;
                       The  majority  of  their  energies,  however,  are  devoted  to  charitable,  pastoral  and
               missionary activities like:

                              Orphanages,  Boys  Villages,  Educational  Assistance  Institutions,  Parishes,
                       Missionary Stations, Schools, Urban Poor Community Organization, Shelters for the
                       urban poor, Meals for the poor, Feeding programs, Cooperatives, Small Clinics (for
                       indigents), Sunday Apostolate (Catechetical formation of children…
                       Through  the  years,  the  odor  of  sanctity  surrounding  Father  Hannibal  has  been
               constantly increasing and the generations of beneficiaries, witnesses, admirers, and followers
               of his sanctity and charity also solicited for his glorification on earth.

                       On April 21, 1945, the Diocesan Process for the Canonization of Father Hannibal Mary
               Di Francia started in Messina. After the approval of his writings in May 1974, John Paul II
               promulgated the Decree of the Heroic Virtues of Father Hannibal on December 21, 1989, and
               declared him as ‘Venerable’.
                       Before that, on March 8, 1987, the Ecclesiastical Tribunal of Guaxupe (Brazil) opened
               a Process about the presumed miraculous healing of a girl, Gleida Ferreira Danese, through the

               miraculous.
                       This opened the way for the solemn day, October 7, 1990, when Pope John Paul II
               proclaimed Father Hannibal Mary Di Francia a Blessed.
                       On October 24, 2002, the Diocesan Tribunal of Jaro, Iloilo, Philippines opened the
               process about the presumed miraculous recovery of a child, Charisse Nicole Diaz, through the
               intercession of Blessed Hannibal. On February 19, 2004, John Paul II recognized it as a miracle
               and allowed the canonization of Blessed Hannibal Mary Di Francia.
                       Finally, on May 16, 2004, Father Hannibal Mary Di Francia was proclaimed a Saint of
               the universal Church.
                       With his canonization, the people of God have more reasons to venerate and invoke this
               Saint as the Apostle par excellence of Prayer for Vocations, as the Father of the orphans and
               the poor, and as an intercessor to obtain more and holy priestly, religious, and lay vocations for
               the Church.
                       The good laborer who totally spent himself for the harvest of the Lord, the outstanding
               hero of the Rogate, the father of the orphans and of the poor, the man who never said ‘no’, has
               become a shining star in the firmament of the Church, for the ‘greater consolation of the Heart
               of Jesus’, and for ours as well.
