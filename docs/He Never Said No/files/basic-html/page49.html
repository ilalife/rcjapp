               6. The Year of Blessings

                       In the nascent community, troubles were not lacking as tribulations accompany all the
               works of the Lord. On the contrary, they are the seal of the divine delights.
                                                         9
                       First of all, a separation took place , which increased the already existing prejudices
               against Father Hannibal and his work, including the biases even of the Diocesan Clergy of
               Messina.



                  9  The nature of this book does not allow a broad and exhaustive exposition of the facts, but I believe that some
               clarifications may be needed so as not to alter the truth.
                  In 1897, Fr. Francesco Di Francia, who had been helping from time to time in Avignone for nine years, left
               his  brother  Hannibal.  Differences  in  ideas  about  administration  were  the  basis  of  a  painful  situation  in  the
               Institution, and thus the separation became necessary.
                  Certainly, the governance of Father Hannibal was peculiar and original. Mons. Di Tommaso, Bishop of Oria
               perfectly classified it in these words: “His administration was that of a Saint. It would look rather imprudent,
               because  he  was  daring,  endlessly  trusting  in  the  Providence.”  Now  we  must  honestly  recognize  that  such
               governance is not ordinary, and if requires a particular vocation in those who exercise it and no less in those who
               submit to it. Certain positions require heroism; and this, obviously, is not for everyone! Indeed, we have to keep
               in mind that Father Hannibal cannot be judged with common criteria.
                  On May 4, 1895, the local periodical The Awakening (Il Risveglio) mentioned Father Hannibal as a man of the
               temper of Cottolengo. Those who read the life of that Saint will know how many troubles he went through because
               others wanted to measure him with the human meter. The Father never left the community lacking what was
               necessary. In addition, regarding the spiritual aspect, piety, and interior life of those entrusted to him, he cultivated
               them with all the effort, to the point of being accused of exaggerating. However, it was necessary to see him by
               putting one’s self in his shoes in order to judge his actions properly.
                  Here lies the intimate origin of the division that happened in the community of the Daughters of Divine Zeal
               at that time. Fighting for survival every day, as it happened in Avignone, and being always with nothing in facing
               what  seemed  impossible  because  the  Father's  generosity  gave  everything  to  the  poor  made  life  impossible,
               humanly speaking, for some of those young Sisters. Had the matter been limited to the material sacrifice of the
               intimidating work and the unceasing begging, perhaps they could have adjusted to it. But, as they said, the peace
               of the spirit was endangered because they did not find in the community that material order and regularity of
               practices, which are a duty and a privilege of the well-settled Institutes. However, they did not realize that such
               conditions could not be expected in the embryonic state of Father Hannibal’s Institution. They wanted a new set
               up and meanwhile animosity and discontent were spreading in the community. Fr. Francesco had referred those
               young Sisters to Father Hannibal, thus they brought their complaints to Fr. Francesco. He shared their ideas and
               so it is not correct to say that he was collaborating with Hannibal ‘with the docility of a loving child rather than
               of a brother’ (FELICI, page 81). The community was thus divided into two, and Fr. Francesco considered it right
               to support his protégés.
                  I perfectly agree with I. Felici, that ‘this cannot surprise us at all’; ... it was just like that, and it was always
               painful. Sister Veronica of the Child Jesus, whose original name was Natala Briguglio, stood out among the young
               Sisters who aspired to change the situation.
                  The community was deeply divided; and speaking of ‘misunderstandings, persecutions and even slanders’ at
               the expenses of Sister Veronica and the lack of a ‘spiritual director capable of understanding and guiding her’ (I.
               FELICI,  p.  197)  certainly  does  not  clarify  the  situation  and  much  less  adequately  explains  the  solution  that
               followed.
                  There were appeals to the Ecclesiastical Authority and Cardinal. Guarino, with a letter of August 3, 1896,
               deposed the Superior, Sister M. Carmela D'Amore. However, things did not change, because the new Superior,
               Sister M. Nazzarena Maione, was close to the Founder no less than Sister D'Amore.
                  The discontented Sisters thought it was better to separate. At night, without any notice, passing through the
               Church door, on March 11, 1897, (not 1895: this is also an important correction!) they went to Roccalumera, a
               village in the Province of Messina, and remained there under the guidance of Fr. Francesco.
