    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>8. “See the Miracles of Providence”

                       On a trip to Rome with Fr. Carmelo, who was still a student at that time, Father Hannibal
               asked him how much he had.
                       “One hundred Lire, Father.”
                       “It’s too little. However, give them to me.”
                       It was useless to protest that at least fifty was needed for the return ticket... The Father
               asked for all of it, placed them into an envelope and gave them to a poor priest that he had seen
               in the other compartment.
                       Meanwhile, a man asked Fr. Carmelo who the other priest with him was. Upon hearing
               that it was Father Di Francia, he rejoiced at having met a priest of whom he had heard people
               talking about so well and, when the Father returned to his seat, he went to greet him and gave
               him an envelope.
                       There was one thousand Lire inside the envelope. The Father remarked to the young
               Carmelo, “Do you see the miracles of the Providence? Had we given fifty Lire, we would have
               received only five hundred. We gave one hundred and the Lord sent us one thousand.”


               9. The Three Capuchins

                       On a winter evening, three Capuchin Fathers alighted at the Oria station from the last
               train trip of that day. They met our Brother Giuseppe Antonio Meli who heard them talking of
               going to the Seminary for accommodation.
                       When Father Hannibal learned about it, he rebuked the Brother for not having offered
               them hospitality in our House and asked him to go, despite of the late hour and pouring rain,
               equipped with a lamp, to look for them and to invite them.  Brother Guiseppe found them at
               the front gate of the Seminary, which at that hour of the night would never open.
                       Those good Fathers accepted the invitation. First, Father Hannibal apologized, then he
               had warm water ready to wash their feet. He went to look for blankets so that they would not
               suffer because it was cold; and because there were not enough blankets in the House, he gave
               them his own.


               10. I Did Not Want to Leave Without Blessing You


                       In October 1926, Father Hannibal was in Oria. He felt that his end was nearing. He did
               not have the strength to walk up to the Sisters’ House in San Benedetto. He invited the Sisters
               to come down to San Pasquale, the male House, to receive his blessing.
                       As  the  community  was  lining  up  in  front  of  him,  he  asked  solicitously,  “Where  is
               Sammeri?”
                       Sammeri was a former orphan girl who, after finishing her education, did not want to
               leave the Institute, and had remained there as a daughter [guest-helper] of the House. The
               Father could not forget her whom he considered as his daughter. They told him that she could
               not come because of her corns [calluses], which afflicted her. He sent a carriage right away to
               pick her up.
                       When she arrived, he said, “My dear, I will never come anymore to Oria, and I did not
               want to leave without giving you my blessing. As for the corns, recommend yourself to St.
