    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>hovels, with some hundred inhabitants, living in deplorable promiscuity and amidst misery and
               dirt.  Consequently,  it  was  a  place  of  great  confusion,  ignorance,  and  the  most  degrading
               material and moral disorder. That place had been defined as “a portion of a cursed land,
               inhabited by a herd of beasts.”
                       Hannibal immediately realized that “there could be no better place to exercise some
               charity out of love for our Lord Jesus Christ who loves the poor so much and wants them to be
               saved.”
                       In front of the slender figure of the young priest who came with the claim of a reformer,
               the “somebodies” of that ghetto felt the duty to take a stand and ordered him openly to leave.
               “To convert this kind of people, we need two Capuchins with a beard this long,” they said,
               accompanying the words with an eloquent gesture. “It is not a job for you. You must leave.”
                       Hannibal did not leave. Instead, he plunged into that mud up to his neck. One of the
               toughest struggles he had to suffer was against… insects. Bugs swarmed on the rotting garbage
               and horribly infested that crowd of poor people “to the point that some of them died, - Father
               Hannibal wrote - slowly devoured by those insects.”
                       Despite  all  the  hygienic  steps  taken,  the  bugs  could  not  be  exterminated.  Father
               Hannibal got rid of them through faith, to which he would always resort. He made a fervent
               novena to St. Joseph Benedict Labre who used to keep those small insects on himself as a
               penance. The Saint intervened, since Father Hannibal did not have the same strange vocation
               of the great French Pilgrim.

                       Father Hannibal’s work began slowly to bear fruit. At the cost of countless sacrifices,
               the Avignone slums changed its face and were redeemed both morally and materially. “The
               Father”, as Father Di Francia began to be called, made that ill-famed place the center of his
               works of charity and zeal that was to spread widely in Italy and abroad, especially to the
               advantage of the abandoned orphans.



               4. Beginning the Work

                       Let us go back to the beginning and try to follow Father Hannibal in his first apostolic
               experiences among those people. He started to work in that hellish bedlam of Avignone, a huge
               task that showed clearly the virtue of the young priest. That herd of brutes had to be raised first
               to the level of being human, and then to the dignity of being Christians. He was well aware that
               he had to start with the body to reach the soul, treasuring the advice of Venerable Ludovico da
               Casoria, “Once you find a poor man and had him cleaned and clothed from head to toe, and
               after you have helped him for at least a month, then you can start talking to him about the
               Confession.”
                       So Hannibal started to clean, provide clothes, beds, food, and money. He began to buy
               those hovels, unfortunately at the price of gold, to have a home-base and a meeting place.
                       However, it was impossible to continue working alone. Some priests joined him, first
               of all, Canon Ciccolo who was particularly endowed with organizational abilities but only to
               call the attention of the city officials about the miserable conditions of that neighborhood, and
               to solicit contributions. On March 19, 1881, the matrons of Messina’s aristocracy prepared and
               served a meal for all those poor. That same morning, for the first time, a Mass was celebrated
               in one of the shanties, transformed into a chapel. The following year, March 19, 1882, a meal
               was prepared again for all the children of the neighborhood. In October of the same year, Fr.
               Angelo Colantoni, of the Franciscans, offered another meal to celebrate the centennial of St.
