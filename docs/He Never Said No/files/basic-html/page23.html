    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>His years as a cleric were remarkable especially for an intensive preaching activity in
               Messina and its surroundings. It would be rare today to see a seminarian preaching with the
               intensity of the young Di Francia but times then led to this. We would like to mention the
               Saturday sermons he preached for several years about Our Lady; the homilies for the whole
               month of May of 1876 in the Parish Church of San Lorenzo, when he introduced the devotion
               to our Lady of Lourdes in Messina; and in the following July, the novena of the Most Precious
               Blood in the Church of St. Luke.

                       He even received an invitation, with the approval of the respective Bishops, to preach
               a novena for St. Veronica Giuliani in Città di Castello (Perugia), but he had to decline because
               of health problems.


               4. Collaboration with The Catholic Word

                       In the meantime, Hannibal continued his collaboration with the weekly newspaper The
               Catholic Word.
                       He composed ‘The Church and the 1870 Ecumenical Council’, a poem in metered
               verses without rhyme, which continued through several issues of the newspaper retracing the
               history of the Councils and singing the glories of the Church.
                                                                      th
                       ‘Pains and Triumphs’, a solemn poem for the 25  anniversary of the crowning of Pius
               IX, was published in June 1871. ‘August 23, 1871’ marks the day in which Pius IX celebrates
               the pontificate of St. Peter. Since Hannibal was in Rome on September 20, 1871, he wrote the
               ‘Reminiscences of the City of Rome’.
                       Of course, in all these verses, the author cannot but deplore the violence done to the
                                                               4
               Church and the Pope with the breach of Porta Pia.

                  4
                    Publishing again these verses in the book Faith and Poetry, fifty years later, Father Hannibal added this note,
               “These verses were written by the author immediately after the entry of the Italian army in Rome when the spirit
               of all the Catholics and true lovers of the Supreme Pontiff felt wounded in their attachment to the Vicar of Jesus
               Christ. Nobody knew what would have happened to the Pope. [TN: Rome was part of the Pope’s State that
               comprised the central portion of Italy. The entry of the Italian army in Rome after a symbolic battle and the breach
               at Porta Pia marked the end of the Papal State and therefore also of the temporal power of Pope. Pius IX, who was
               the Pope then, was confined into what is today known as the Vatican State]. Later on, the events demonstrated
               how  the  Almighty,  who  turns  everything  to  his  glory,  has  granted  success  to  his  divine  perspective  with  the
               exaltation of the Roman Pontifical Sovereignty. In fact, in the many years that Rome has been aggregated to Italy,
               even the enemies of the Holy See were forced to admire closely what the glory of the Papacy means and the
               unshakable stability of this divine Institution. They had to recognize that the gates of Hell, that is, all the adverse
               infernal or human powers, would not prevail against the Church and will never prevail, according to the infallible
               promise of Our Lord Jesus Christ: ‘They shall not prevail!’, as it has been confirmed by twenty centuries of
               history. In the swirling of the passions, clashing of political parties, and agitation of peoples, the divine figure of
               the Vicar of Jesus Christ, in more than fifty years since the taking over of Rome [by the Italian army], has remained
               noble, sublime, peacekeeping, admonishing, generous, and holy, a true image of the redeeming Christ and of
               God! The Italian conscience has remained enchanted at the feet of the unshakable Rock of the Vatican, by the
               triumphs of a helpless Venerable Old Man [the Pope] whom the world admires stupefied! In this way, those who
               knew the Papacy only through the mockery and the misleading news of the bad press were disenchanted and they
               even wound up admiring and loving what they saw and touched with their hands.” In 1921, when Father Hannibal
               wrote this footnote, the “Conciliation” (Conciliazione) was still far and the Roman Question remained actual and
               sensitive [TN: Rome was the capital of Italy led by an anticlerical and masonic government and at the same time,
               it was See of the Pope, head of the Catholic Church restricted to the Vatican State]. “For what concerns the Roman
               Question which is still alive, though wishing that our noble, great, and powerful homeland, Italy, be privileged
               by God among all the nations, this author entrusts himself without any restriction to follow the mind of the Vicar
               of Christ and his successors”.
