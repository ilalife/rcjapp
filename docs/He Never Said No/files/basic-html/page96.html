    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>He  did  not  want  to  be  called  ‘founder’.  Often  he  would  play  with  the  words:  ‘de-
                                           *
               founder’, ‘smelter’, ‘glutton’  and in a letter to Melanie he signed as ‘Founder, Superior and
               Director of the Castles in the sky’. In the solemn declaration he made on July 1 and 2, 1913,
               he stated that the Work was founded by God, and the Most Holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary
               were its divine Superiors.
                       He wrote to Fr. Palma, “I see that I just ruined everything, that my life was only a chain
               of mistakes, errors, inexperience, temerities, and what is worse, bad examples.” Another time,
               after a failure, “It is very clear to me that the Lord did so for my sins, and I am not happy that
               so many men and women in our Institutes often bear the punishment for my sins! May the
               Almighty credit it to their merit!”
                       In his self-eulogy Father Hannibal wrote, “That deceased [Father Hannibal is speaking
               of himself!] wants it to be known that in the entire course of his earthly life, he caused many
               souls and people to suffer and aggrieved many hearts! He asks forgiveness from God and from
               all for every bad example and for any suffering caused to whomever!”
                       To Fr. Vitale: “I say always that when I leave, things work better and many difficulties
               are overcome. Long live Jesus!”
                       Father Hannibal thought that he had ruined the work of God and therefore he called
               himself a botcher, or rather the sole botcher of the entire Work, while the others were busy
               building it.
                       He used to tell us, “What is this Work in God's plans? I imagine it as a large building
               with several floors, stately decorations, large courtyards, and vast halls; or as an immense
               garden, with parks, villas, farmhouses, etc. How much good we could do! How many souls to
               save! How much glory for our Lord and consolation for his most gentle Heart! This is the
               Work. How I wish that God had found another person instead of me or had found greater
               fidelity in me! However, alas! My sins have reduced the Work to a miserable little plant, with
               a stunted life ... My sins have kept the Work confined to the misery of the Avignone Houses!”
                       About his own Work, he wrote that it was “directed by me with negligence, but I was
               unable to destroy it, as the Lord Jesus protected it against any blunder of mine.” Later he
               stated, “I worked more to destroy than to build! And if I was unable to destroy everything, that
               was because the work, as it seems, is God’s and the Lord did not allow it!”
                       Humility was his preferred virtue since it is the virtue of the Sacred Heart.

                       One day, the young students were lively playing in the courtyard, and when they saw
               Father Hannibal, they ran to him. He asked them, “Dear boys, what is the virtue that makes us
               more acceptable to the heart of God?”
                       “Humility, Father, humility!”
                       He smiled, with pleasure: we had read his thought.
                       “Very well, it’s really humility.” Then, he added, “Go on playing” and he left.
                       In his “Letter to the Friends” meant for the people of righteous mind, even though not
               practicing religion, Father Hannibal tried to make them understand the value of humility with
               an argument suited to them, “Some people believe that to humble oneself means to depreciate
               one’s self and that humility is abasement. On the contrary, humility makes us great and lifts us
               up to God. In fact, humility is the death of pride, arrogance, ambition, and conceit: all passions
               that devalue the reasonable person. Humility makes us courteous, prudent, and agreeable to
               others. Just as pride makes us demanding with others, humility, which is the mother of modesty



               *  E.N. In Italian, the words sfondatore (de-founder, destroyer), fonditore (smelter), mangiatore (glutton) sound
               very similar to ‘fondatore’ (founder).
