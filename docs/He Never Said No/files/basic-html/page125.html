    <pre style="white-space:pre-line"><code>Mons. Francesco Parrillo, an Official of the Roman Rota, a Vatican tribunal, assigned
               by the Holy See to inspect the Institutes, arrived in Messina. He had biases against the Father’s
               Work, and it seemed that his objections did not disappear after his visit. However, after talking
               with Father Hannibal, whose appearance, attitude, and spirit left a deep impression on him, he
               had a sleepless and tormented night...
                       When,  on  the  following  day,  Fr.  Vitale  went  to  see  him  for  some  explanation,  the
               Monsignor opened fully and honestly his heart. Previously, he had thought of suppressing the
               Institutions, but now he was convinced that in so doing he would go against the will of God.
               “Last night, I was unable to close my eyes. I had in front of me the figure of a holy man saying
               to me, ‘God is with me!’ I reviewed in my mind what I had seen and heard, the words of this
               man of God, the right purpose, and the way of life of his Works, and I felt an inner voice that
               reproached me for my intentions. I had to convince myself that I was wrong and that I had in
               front of me a holy Work which the Lord wants and which must be helped at any cost.”
                       Upon returning to Rome, he worked actively on the processing of the necessary steps
               so that the Archbishop of Messina, Mons. Angelo Paino, on August 6, 1926, the Fast of the
               Transfiguration  of  Our  Lord  and  first  Friday  of  the  month,  could  issue  the  two  decrees
               establishing the two religious Congregations and approving their Rules.

                       In 1910, in a letter to Fr. Palma, Father Hannibal had written, “I pray God to enable me
               to say, ‘Now let your servant go in peace’ [nunc dimittis...] when I will see the small plant
               blossom, becoming well-rooted and giving fruits. Let us trust the Most Gentle Heart of Jesus,
               our Supreme Good, His Holy Mother, and our dear Angels and Saints. Meanwhile, whatever
               we can do, let us do it in the Holy Name of Jesus!”
                       He had done all he could and thus had arrived at the nunc dimittis...

                       Also in that year, he had made his customary visit to the Houses. The news of the
               canonical approval reached him in Trani, where after some days, on August 15, the Feast of
               Our Lady’s Assumption, the Lord imposed on him another sacrifice with the death of one of
               the first and most faithful Sisters, Maria Carmela D’Amore. He assisted her in her illness and
               for her funeral made a wonderful eulogy that was later printed.
                       Then he reached Rome, went back to Oria, and on October 15, returned to Messina.


               3. His Last Illness

                       On the morning of January 24, 1927, the Father did not get up from his bed. That night,
               his illness had started to agonize him and the alternating changes in his health brought him to
               the end.
                       On February 20, the ‘Sexagesima Sunday’, he celebrated the Holy Mass for the last
               time. From that day on, he had to content himself with the Holy Communion. It was a very
               great sacrifice for him, but he consoled himself saying, “I want to do God’s will. The Lord’s
               will is above all things, even the Holy Mass.”
                       On  March  15,  Tuesday,  he  asked  for  the  Anointment  of  the  Sick,  which  was
               administered to him, according to his desire, by Fr. Ernesto Fochesato, a Camillian. He thought
               of securing the particular protection of St. Camillus for his own final hour.

                       Don Orione, upon learning of the Father’s illness, on March 16, sent him “a telegram
               full of brotherly love”, to which Father Hannibal responded “as his heart dictated.” The next
               day,  he  gave  him  an  account  of  his  condition,  “I  became  unable  to  read,  write,  and  to
               concentrate. By night and by day I am in between life and death. I want only what Jesus wants.
