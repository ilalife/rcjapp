Vitale  wrote  the  precious                biography  of  our  padre,  the  main  source  for  those  future                authors who will write his story. However, this biography does                not contain the whole padre. As Fr. Vitale has pointed out, we                perceive  the  spirit  of  our  padre  equally  and  perhaps                prevalently  in  his  own  writings.  Because  his  writings  are  a                precious  guide  to  the,  Rogationists  and  the  Daughters  of                Divine Zeal's spiritual life, as well as to their government and                to the efficient development of the Rogationist apostolate, Fr.                Vitae hoped that they would be published.                     Our communities feel the need of reading and meditating                on our padre's writings; but the superior general, even more                so, feels such a need; and urges that they be published since                he  has  the  responsibility  of  keeping  the  spirit  of  our  padre                alive in the institutions. To meet his urgent solicitude we have                made this Anthology - a collection of flowers - flowers plucked                from the garden of our padre's writings.                  5                     It is well known that our padre was a prolific writer, but                due to lack of time he did not finish any work. Not even the                dossier    «  Spirit  of  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  »  (*)  is                complete; in fact, the treatise about the                         (*)  Our  padre  addressed  the  work  to  the  Daughters  of  Divine                Zeal  because  they  were  more  numerous  than  the  Rogationists;                however,  our  padre  repeatedly  said  that  he  fixed  the  spirit  of  the                whole institute in this work and that he had a mind to add what was                peculiar to the Rogationists.","Rogate that he had promised does not exist! What a pity!                     However,  we  have  voluminous  notes  of  speeches,                circulars, confidential letters, numerous outlines of rules such                as the rules or the plain prescriptions which he wrote for the                use of various male and female communities; these writings                are  not  mere  outlines,  on  the  contrary  some  paragraphs  of                rules resemble true treatises on the spiritual life, which reflect                the spirit and the personality of the person who is our padre.                     Our  padre's  records  are  a  vast  treasure;  by  picking  up                spangles, nuggets, and golden streams we can easily gather                riches. Getting out of the metaphor we say that the wealth of                our padre's teaching springs from his records, outlines, and                directions;  if  we  gather  them  with  love,  follow  them  with                wisdom,  and  are  generously  faithful  to  the  grace  of  our                vacation, we Rogationists and Daughters of Divine Zeal will                became children worthy of our padre.                     As a scheme of this work we have chosen the « Forty                Declarations and Promises » our founder wrote far the priests                in August 1910, in St. Pier Niceto. Around that time, Fr. Vitale                had already entered the order, while Canon Celona was also                willing to enter. Through this work, our padre expounded the   6                spirit  of  the  order  briefly.  The    «  Forty  Declarations  and                Promises  »  form  the  forty  chapters  of  this  book:  each                declaration is a somewhat broad topic, around which we have                gathered our padre's writings we felt to be appropriate.                     This  work  is  not  meant  to  be  a  rule  for  changing  or                substituting  the  rules  in  force  in  the  communities;  in  these                writings  we  find  the  whole  padre  with  his  spirit,  ideals,                teaching, charity, and zeal along with references to usages of                time and places sometimes superseded.","Especially  the  repetitions  we  have  not removed  because of                the  nature  of  the  work.  They  show  our  padre  alive  and                working,  always  busy  to  sanctify  his  children,  as  well  as  to                strengthen the foundation in the way of the Lord. This was his                only  aim,  the  program  of his  life.  This must be  ours  for  the                greatest consolation of the heart of Jesus!

Cor. 4, 15): « Even if you have ten thousand guardians in                your life in Christ, you have only one father. For in your life in                Christ Jesus I have become your father by bringing the Goad                News to you.» With easy, ample, deep application your padre                tells  you:  «  Through  the  grace  of  Gad,  source  of  any                fatherhood, I have begotten you to the religious life, spirit, and   9                apostolate of the Rogationists by giving you the constitutions,                the treasure of my teaching, and fecund abundance of heroic,                continuous,  practical  examples  as  well  as  by  immolating                myself  for  the  foundation  of  the  order  and  for  each  one  of                you. » This complete, generous, effective, spiritual fatherhood                of  your  Padre  founder  continues  «  until  Christ's  nature  is                formed in you,» until each of you reproduces Jesus in himself                according to his vocation, following the perfect, lovable, close                model  of  Padre  Di Francia,  who  says  to  you:  « Imitate  me,                just as I imitate Christ» (I. Cor. 4,16; 11, 1).","It is fortunate for the children of Padre Mary Hannibal Di                Francia  to  have  preserved  such  a  great  treasure  of                documents, exhortations, counsels and criteria that deal with                so  many  standpoints  of  ascetism,  discipline,  formation,                apostolate,  and  government  of  the  orders.  This  fatherly                heritage could not be hidden or scattered. We heartly praise                the superior general for having disposed with wise perception                the  collection  and  the  arrangement  of  the  fatherly  treasure                and for having entrusted sedulous, clever, and filial hearted                people with this responsibility.                      A man's honor derives from the respect he showed to his                father (Eccl. 3, 11). Since this blessed book will be the fecund                root which is going to infuse new blood into so many works,                booklets, and editions of any kind, it will be the conductor of                the  strengthening,  sweetest,  continuous  blessing  of  your                padre; an the other hand, by explaining and applying the new                blood they will draw from this anthology, the works will form                the Rogationists' sound literature.                      While presenting my warmest congratulations, I pray to   10                obtain  elect  blessings  on  the  two  orders  and  I  encourage                them to follow such a great, lovable father founder with the                most generous, happy loyalty.

I  intend  to  accomplish  all  this  with  God's  help  and                my own good will.                                    1. PURE INTENTION                      The Little Refuge of St. Joseph novices will keep in mind                the  holy  aim  they  had  when  they  humbly  applied  for                admittance  in  the  Little  Refuge.  The  aim  is:  to  want  only   13                Jesus  and  to  belong  to  him  only...  By  belonging  totally  to                Jesus and by rejecting totally the corrupt deceiving world; by                striving for a virtuous life, overcoming defects and bad habits;                to achieve the happy state of divine union (R.L.P.).                     The  Little  Poor  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  will  be                detached  from  worldly  goods  in  order  to  find  and  possess                Jesus only, he who is the hidden treasure of faith. Having no                concern with worldly matters, they will seek the glory of God                and the salvation of souls, which are the interests of the most                holy heart of Jesus (R.L.P.).                     They will attentively beware of the lightest voluntary","defect, also avoiding the unintentional ones, as much as they                can (D.S.S.).                     The  Little  Retreat  probationers  will  have  the  pure                intention to enter the religious status in order to belong totally                to God, to promote the greater consolation of the most holy                Heart  of  Jesus,  and  to devote  themselves  to  the  service  of                the poor (R.P.).                     I declare that I entered this institute because I felt myself                moved  by  pure  intention  of  achieving my  own  sanctification                and of giving up myself to God, living the religious life through                the  perfect  observance  of  this  institute's  rules  without  any                perspective  of  a  personal  position  or  any  ulterior  motive.                Since I have renounced worldly matters I enter the institute as                a new creature, keeping in my mind and heart nothing of the                world; therefore, I will never think of it nor will I speak of my                past  life  in  the  world  or  in  my  family  with  anyone  in  the                institute (D.P.).                     « The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are                clear, your whale body will be full of light; but if your eyes are                bad, your body will be in darkness » (Mt. 6, 22).                     The  eyes  stand  as  a  symbol  for  pure  intention  to   14                accomplish  everything  for  God,  for  his  glory,  and  for  the                greater  consolation  of  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus.  Pure                intention will make the actions of the probationer upright and                good, while lack of pure intention will make them obscure.                     The probationer who does not purely work for Jesus will                never achieve the spiritual life. For him, the virtues will be like                an  external  practice  whose  performance  will  lead  him  to  a                spirit  of  simulation  and  hypocrisy,  which  makes  him                undeserving to live in the house of the Lord (P.R.P.).","2. POSTULATE                      The  probationers  who  aim  at  entering  the  religious                community for the greatest consolation of the Heart of Jesus,                must form their spirit according to Christian perfection. During                the  postulate  they  shill  aim at  destroying  the  desires  of  the                natural self, or better yet, at putting to death their old being                (Rom. 6, 6) in order that they may live a new life with Christ.                They mint aim at becoming men of God, with the Lord's help                (P.R.P.).                     Before the taking of the garb the candidates for religious                life  are  to  be  tested  accurately.  The  master  of  piety  and                experience will train them in Christian perfection, teaching the                religious  virtues  and  the  order's  rules.  If  the  candidates  for                religious life have no, disposition to piety or recollection, but                have  attachment  to  themselves  or  to  their  relatives  or  are                mendacious and false or gluttonous or wrathful, they must be                sent home, unless they amend since the beginning (C.R.).                     (Talking  to  the  Lord):  Postulate  is  the  time  when  our                vocation is tested in order that we may see whether we really                want  to  answer  the  divine  cell.  Now  is  the  time  when  the   15                strongest proofs will rigorously test our intentions in order to                see whether they are right or wrong, sincere or false. Now is                the time when the test is going to discard those who have no                goad  will!  O  adorable  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  give  us  holy  will,                pure,  good  intention  so  that  we  may  accept  any  test,                mortification,  and  contradiction,  heartily  and humbly.  Please                give  us  a  loving  grace  to  become  fond  of  all  virtues,  but                mainly of you, God of the virtues, and of Immaculate Mary,                your  mother,  our  teacher,  owner,  and  superior.  Jesus,  ,our                goodness,  let us  grow  in  our  holy  vocation, let  us be  yours                and persevere in your call till our last breath (From a primal                rite and prayer far admittance to postulate)!","Since  I  am  going  to  take  the  garb  of  the  Rogationist                novices of the heart of Jesus:                        1. I assert that I am unworthy of such a great grace,                because my admittance to the novitiate is due to God and to                my superiors' kindness;                        2. I formally assert that the entrance into the novitiate                along with the taking of the sacred garb is the beginning of                the true test which will help me to develop religious virtues.                Henceforth  I  acknowledge  that  from  now  on  I  cannot  be                excused for my faults, which will be more serious owing to the                religious  garb,  which  binds  me  both  to  give  good  example                and to practice the virtues.                     Likewise  I  acknowledge  that  the  novitiate  requires  a                humble,  penitential  life,  which  needs  to  be  tested  by                mortifications, humiliations, and penances that my superiors                deem to give me; therefore I will humbly accept them without                reply or excuse, even though I think or I am sure of not being                at fault.                     I  recognize  that  the  constitutions  are  the  rules  of  my                behavior.  I  promise  to  observe  them  exactly  and  to  accept                any penance in case of infringement.                      16                     At last, I declare that if these promises are hard for me                or the life of the novitiate is too severe for me, I am free to                refuse  the  taking  of  the  garb;  but  if  I  take  it,  by  doing  so  I                confirm the promises and declarations, putting myself in the                hands  of  holy obedience  as  an  unworthy  slave  of  the most                holy  Virgin,  in  order  that  I  may  uncomplainingly  accept  the                suffering  and  the  humiliations  that  are  part  of  my  spiritual                formation. The life that destroys my natural self to let me live                with Jesus Christ my Lord begins with the taking of the garb                (Promises before the taking of the habit, March 17, 1907).                     I  solemnly  promise  that  when  God's  will  has  been                discerned by my superiors and I am permitted to take","the  garb  I  will  not  deceive  myself  by  thinking  that  the                probation  time  is  over  or  that  I  may  live  as  I  like;  on  the                contrary, I will acknowledge that the true test of religious life                (mortification,  humility,  obedience,.  practice  of  divine  love,                charity  toward  neighbor,  patience,  and  perfect  execution  of                my duties) begins with the entrance in the novitiate.                   The  duties  of  the  novitiate  are  the  following:  prayer,                penance,  humiliation  for  Jesus,  renunciation  of  my  opinion                and will, perfect observance of the runes, pure zeal and holy                wishes for divine glory and salvation of souls, fervent prayer                to  obtain  good  workers  toy  the  Church,  practice  of  holy                poverty,  detachment,  true  service  to  our  divine  owner  and                mother,  of  whom  I  am  a  faithful  slave  of  love,  and  the                acquisition of interior virtues.                   This  is  my  opinion  about  the  novitiate;  therefore,  when                holy  obedience  calls  me,  I  will  enter  the  novitiate  with  holy                fear in order to begin the destruction of my natural self and to                transform myself in the crucified Jesus.                   As  an  aspirant,  as  a  probationer,  and  above  all  as  a                novice, with the Lord's help and my own good will I promise                to accept any test and mortification the superiors will ask of   17                me, knowing that without roofs of penance, mortification, and                humiliation I wild be unable to subdue my own pride in order                to become a perfect bride of the crucified Jesus (D.P.).                                   3. TAKING OF THE GARB                    You  have  taken  the  garb  to  your  great  satisfaction  as  it                usually  happens  to  those  who  take  it.  Take  care,  however:                your  fervor  must  not be  superficial  and  fleeting,  but  serious                and  lasting.  You  must  understand  the garb's  significance  in                your life.                     The meaning is: renunciation of the world. In fact, is","there  any  likeness  between  the  worldly  habits  and  the                religious ones? Not at all. On the contrary, they are quite the                reverse.  The  worldly  habits  are  made  of  good  fabric,  the                religious ones of poor material; the former are dazzling, the                latter  dark;  the  worldly  habits  have  fringes  and  lace,  the                religious  ones  are  simple;  the  first  are  tight  or  open,  the                second, roomy and closed; the first appear vainglorious, the                last modest and humble; the mundane habits are the uniform                of  the  world,  the  religious  garbs  signify  belonging  to  Jesus                Christ!                     Haw very precious is the religious garb! The saints loved                it so much that they wanted to die wearing it.                     The religious garb is precious because it represents the                religious  virtues,  while  impatience,  disobedience,  pride,                immodesty are at loggerheads with it.                     Take care: the cowl does not make the monk! How many                laymen,  who  bear  no  religious  garb,  will  appear  better                dressed  with  virtues  and  spirit  on  the  judgment  day!                Therefore, follow your holy vocation faithfully, complying with                the duties the religious garb requires of you (Speech, May 18,                1915).                                                    18                     To the amazement of the angels, God clothed you with                the  precious  religious  garb,  at  whose  comparison  the  most                costly worldly clothing are rags. Before you took the religious                garb, it was blessed with these words: « Garb which the Saint                Fathers considered to be a symbol of innocence and humility                for those who renounce the world. »                     By  celestial  enlightenment  the  holy  Fathers  felt  that                those  who renounce  the  world  wear a  garb as  a  symbol  of                innocence and humility; therefore, you must be innocent and                humble:  innocent  by  keeping  yourselves  free  from  any  sin                and by purifying yourselves of past faults,","because by taking the sacred garb you die to the world and                are  born  to  a  new  life.  Humble,  because  the  religious  garb                has nothing to do with worldly pride... Your garb obliges you                to  answer  God's  call  and  to  Lift  up  your  heart  and  soul  in                foretaste  of  the  heavenly  happiness...  (Speech,  Aug.  24,                1809).                     Dearest  children,  the  Lord  called!  you  to  religious  life                through  a  special  grace.  By  answering  the  divine  cold  you                leave the world, where everything is risky for the soul, where                Gad is often forgotten, and where predominate bad example,                pernicious  sayings  and  happenings,  human  respect,                disregard for the sacraments and for eternal salvation.                     By entering the order you enter a haven of salvation, you                enter the house of God.                     In  the  religious  community  everything  leads the  soul  to                Christian perfection, assuring eternal salvation. Religion is the                rule of life, is continuous merit of holy obedience, worship of                God and honor to the most holy Mary, to the angels and the                saints. Religion demands devotion to holy prayer and spiritual                readings,  exercises  of  virtue  and  mortification,  care  of                preaching, good example, reception of the sacraments, and   19                mutual  charity.  The  Religious  live  in  the  presence  of  God,                meditate on the truths of faith, stay with Jesus in the Blessed                Sacrament,  pray,  serve  God,  performing  good  works  and                taking  care  of  their  own  eternal  salvation  as  well  as  that  of                others.  They  enjoy  peace  of  conscience  and  divine                providence, which never fails those who are at the service of                God  living  in  his  grace.  At  last,  they  die  in  a,  holy  manner                sharing the life of the unintelligible, eternal happiness.                     Dearest  children,  to  achieve  these  ,goods  you  have  to                enter  religion  with  purest  intention,  With  a  fullness  of  faith,                and with determined will to persevere until death.","Pure  intention  requires  of  you  to  seek  God,  his  glory,                and  your  sanctification:  it  requires  of  you  to  enter  the                community in order that you may belong to God totally.                     The fullness of faith requires of you to be aware of the                special grace God gave you as well as of the preeminence of                religious  life  in  order that  you  may  consecrate  yourself  with                your  whole  heart,  being  ready  for  any  sacrifice  in  order  to                achieve the great goods of so celestial a status.                     Determined will to persevere must be the base and the                unshakable  foundation  of  the  holy  status  you  choose.  It  is                better  not  to  start  than  to  go  back  after  the  start.  No  one                compels,  you  to  take  the  sacred  garb;  however,  once  you                take it, never will you put it off, not even at your death; it must                go with you to the grave. You will never back temptations of                the hellish enemy, personal passions, false suggestions and                snares of the world which will try to lure you back. But you will                fortify yourselves by renewing your determined resolution to                persevere.  Arm  yourselves  with  constancy  and  courage.                Prepare yourselves for the battle against the contrary powers,                natural  fickleness,  and  boredom.  Be  aware  of  the  apostle's                saying: « An athlete who runs in a race cannot win the prize   20                unless he obeys the rules » (2 Tim. 2, 5), as well as the word                of  Jesus  Christ:  «  Whoever  holds  out  to  the  end  will  be                saved» (Mc. 13, 13). (From a primal rite of the taking of the                Rogationist garb).                               4. HAPPINESS IN THE RELIGIOUS LIFE                      Dear youth, you have entered the house of God; please                consider the following goads you find.                     Peace.  What  is  it?  The  most  precious  thing  which                includes sweetness of heart, stillness of passions, quiet","of  the  soul  in  God.  Jesus  Christ  said:  Peace  with  you!  You                find this peace in religious life.                     Cheerfulness.  It  is  the  outcome  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  the                fountain  of  holiness.  Owing  to  the  comfort  of  faith,  a  true                Religious is always cheerful, even in the midst of opposition;                therefore you must devote yourself to the service of God with                cheerfulness.                     Holiness.  If  you  follow  your  vocation,  you  will  be  holy.                You  entered  the  religious  house,  which  is  the  fertile  field  of                God's  grace  paying  30,  60,  100  per  cent.  In  this  place  you                find every means for your sanctification such as prayer, the                sacraments,  preaching,  rules,  exercise,  care.  Do  you  find                these in the world? You know that the world is full of risks,                sins, scandals, and that those who live in it are seldom able                to attend to religious life!                     Most  affectionate  parents.  Jesus  Christ  said:  «  Every                one who has left... father or mother... will receive a hundred                times more » (Mt. 19, 29). You find the priests, who are both                fathers and elder brothers, the superiors, who are fathers, the                fellows,  who  are  brothers.  Is  there  any  family  more  joyous,                lovely,  and  dear than  the  religious  one?  Where  do  you  find   21                more union, love, and fidelity?                     You are also provided with the temporal goods, by divine                providence. I assure you that 'the necessities of life will never                fail the house of the Lord. Bread fails so many tables, never                those  of  the  good  Religious:  the  rich  have  wanted  and                suffered, those, however, who search for the Lord shall not                be  deprived  of  any  good  (Ps.  33,  11).  «  We  seem  to  have                nothing,  yet,  we  really  possess  everything»  (2  Cor.  6,  10).                Jesus Christ said: «Be concerned above everything else with                his, kingdom and with what he requires, and he will provide                you  with  all  these  other  things»  (Mt.  6,  33).  The  Lord  will                endow you with spiritual goods, also providing the temporal                ones you","need. O lucky youth, what else will you find in the house of                God?  When  I  told  you  what  you  will  find,  I  began  with  the                lesser: now I will go on to the greater.                      You are lucky! You will find... Jesus, the bridegroom of                loving souls!                      He is beautiful, and no one can compete with him. He is                rich, and we find everything in him because he has all riches                in  his  hands.  He  is  noble  for  his  eternal  generation  and                kingship! He is powerful, for he moves heaven and earth, and                the  universe  obeys  him.  He  is  loyal,  and  he  never  fails,  as                men  do.  He  is  God,  and  he  makes  a  sister  consecrated  to                him a queen on earth and in heaven (Speech, Jan. 18, 1903).                      Happiness springs from peace, but only Jesus gives it.                You  find  this  peace  abundantly  in  religious  life.  Here  the                passions  are  mortified  and  subdued  to  reason  through                observance of rules and obedience. Here the soul lives in the                grace  of  God,  feels  His  presence,  feels  herself  united  with                Him, finds peace, and rests in Him.                       22                      Christian  hope  is  a  fountain  of  great  happiness.  In  the                world, people hope vainly, looking after phantoms, but hope                often  comes  to  disappointment,  and  disappointment  to                desperation. Religious life is unlike mundane life. The great                hope of the soul consecrated to Jesus is God, who makes her                happy, or better yet, very happy! While growing in holiness in                religious life, the soul looks at heaven expecting to be united                with God for ever.                      Joy.  In  this  world,  entertainment  bores!  But  how  much                the  consolations  given  by  Jesus  outdo  the  worldly                amusement!  The  soul  consecrated  to  the  Lard  renounced                earthly recreation, amusing conversations, theaters, movies,                walks,  futilities;  she  renounced  everything  for  Jesus'  sake...                Do you think that our Lord does not know how to recompense                her? He does. He visits her in prayer, in","Holy  Communion;  he  makes  her  savor  a  thousand  spiritual                joys  such  as  the  religious  feasts,  liturgies,  devotions,                preaching,  spiritual  readings,  elating  her  with  a  sweetest                happiness.  She  shares  these  celestial  entertainments  with                Jesus, Mary, and the angels as a thrilling anticipation of the                heavenly joy (Speech, April 6, 1919).                      I do not deny that even in the world and among married                people there are elect souls, Who achieve eternal salvation                with  divine  help.  But  almost  all  of  them  live  unhappily                because  of  troubles,  responsibility,  works,  mishaps,  and  a                thousand pains. Most of them exclaim: « Oh! If I had devoted                myself to God in my youth! If I had foreseen what I was going                to  suffer,  I  Would  have  decided  otherwise!  Happy  the                Religious who live without worldly thoughts attending to their                sanctification only! » The complaints of those who live in the                world ' are too late!                      Quite the opposite is the fate of a youth who answers the                call of divine mercy, leaving the World to consecrate himself                in a religious order. I will show you what this youth is like. He   23                is like a small boat that the stormy waves rock in the open                sea along with other boats, but an invisible hand draws and                thrusts it to the harbor: the lucky boat is safe, but the others                are still; running the risks. O lucky boat, enter the harbor. You                are safe from the storm of the world. Now you are in peace                (Speech, Jan. 18, 1903).                                     5. THE NOVITIATE                      You  are  entering  the  novitiate.  Just  as recruits  are  put                under  military  training  to  become  experts  in  discipline  and                strategy,  the  novices  are  trained  'in  religious  practices  to                became  true  servants  of  Jesus  Christ.  Exercises  of  prayer                and  of  ready,  blind,  joyous  obedience as  well  as  of  charity,                patience, and sacrifice's will transform the","novice into a Religious who will found himself upon humility,                obedience,  love  of  God,  and  zeal  for  his  own  sanctification                and salvation. This is what the novitiate is all about (Speech,                Oct. 20, 1909).                      The novices will be aware of the novitiate as a time of                preparation to become true servants of our Lord Jesus Christ,                the king of eternal glory. Consequently, they will make use of                the novitiate far putting their inner self to death. The novices                entered  the  novitiate  in  order  to  die  to  their  self,  to  be                corrected,  humiliated,  to  be  poor  and  to  be  crucified  with                Jesus  Christ  all  their  4ife  long.  They  will  offer  themselves,                therefore,  as  victims  of  the  divine  love  of  Jesus'  Heart                beginning  from  their  entrance  in  the  novitiate  (Rules  for                Novices. Oct. 4, 1909).                      A pious priest of the Lord will be the novices' master. He                will take care of the novices, training them in the holy virtues                of  humility,  obedience,  and  meekness  as  well  as  in  prayer                and  daily  meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our  Lord.  He  will   24                accustom them to mortification, penance, and self denial and                to grow in their love of Jesus and the most holy Virgin Mary.                He  will  give  proper  lectures,  forming  the  novices  in  the                specific  zeal  of  the  institute,  which  is  the  zeal  for  the  great                command of Jesus: « Pray, therefore... » He will correct the                novices when they fall into defects and by infusing a holy fear                of  the  little  faults  as  a  probable  cause  of  relaxation  he  will                prepare them for the vows (R.R.C.).                      The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  novices  of  the  Heart  of                Jesus  will  consider  the  novitiate  as  the  preparation  time  to                reach a perfect union with Jesus, who is the divine groom of                souls,  and  will  strive  to  become  perfect  brides  and  faithful                servants  of  this  king  of  eternal  glory,  who  will  make  them                share in his everlasting happiness in heaven. But he wants                them to be brides of sacrifice, suffering,","love,  and  zeal  on  earth:  the  bides  of  a  suffering,  poor,                humiliated God, crucified and immolated for the glory of the                Father and the salvation,, of souls.                      To  prepare  themselves  for  the  mystical  wedding  of                religious  profession,  the  novices  of  I  this  least  institute  will                consider  the  novitiate  as  the  time  qualified  for  putting  their                inner self to death. May they enter the novitiate as sentenced                to  death,  as  guided  to  the  gallows  of  justice  Where  their                passions  wil9  be  put  to  death  in  the  midst  of  tears,                mortification, and suffering. For them, the most holy cross of                their  beloved  crucified  spouse  represents  the  mystical                gallows;  upon  this  cross  they  will  find  both  death  for  their                inner  self  according  to  the  flesh  as  well  as  our  Lord  Jesus                Christ, who is the resurrection and the life.                      The new Daughters of Divine Zeal of Jesus' Heart must                understand  that  their  religious  exercises  and  virtues  begin                with  the  novitiate  and  must  grew  with  the  profession  till  the                end of life, when they Will be already true copies of the divine                groom. They will be poor, humiliated, fond of contempt, dead   25                in  the  hands]  of  holy  obedience,  pure  in  the  melting-pot  of                suffering  as  well  as  mortified  penitent,  detached  from                everything end everybody, exhausted by work and sacrifice,                lighted and blazing with the love for Jesus and his most holy                mother, full of pure zeal for divine glory and salvation of souls                as well as zealous for the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests.                      For their august name of Daughters of Divine Zeal of the                Heart of Jesus and for the sublime mission of the Evangelical                Rogation the sisters of this least institute must be just as we                have described above. The novices will be just as the sisters                through  the  divine  help  which  never  fails  the  souls  of  good                will. Jesus, the sweetest over and groom, wants them to be                perfect.","To  achieve  this  goal,  the  sisters  will  be  hungry  and                thirsty  for  suffering  with  Jesus  and  for  Jesus,  for  being                humiliated,  mortified,  and  held  in  contempt.  They  will  do                everything to please the divine Heart of Jesus and to destroy                their  pride,  anger,  attachment,  spirit  of  simulation,  and                laziness of nature as well as bad passions, the results of past                sins,  and  the  natural  ignorance  of  the  mind.  May  they  be                fulfilled with divine light and wisdom (From the beginning of «                Rules for the Novices of Oria»).                                  6. INNER DISPOSITIONS                      « You must be perfect - just as your Father in heaven is                perfect » (Mt. 5, 48).                      Our  Lord  did not  say these  words  to  the  apostles  only                nor  to  all  the  people  without  discrimination,  because  these                words  must  agree  with  the  following  tremendous  saying:                «Many  are  called,  but  few  chosen  »  (Mt.  20,  16).  To  the                chosen ones he said these words: « You must be perfect... »   26                You  that  I  choose  from  the  thousand  to  follow  me,  «  be                perfect just as your Father is perfect ». Where it not the Son                of  God  speaking,  these  words  would  be  absurd!  And  yet,                Jesus spoke so to the elect, preparing the necessary grace to                reach such a perfection (Speech, 1901).                      Because divine mercy let me yield to the strong, gentle                impulse  to  leave  the  world  and  enter  the  Evangelical                Rogation's  institute  in  order  to  better  attend  to  my                sanctification and to the salvation of souls, I want to specify                my  resolves  as  soon  as  I enter  the  order. Since  the  call  to                religious life is a call to sanctification, I declare that I enter this                institute  with  a  steady  mind  of  persevering  and  sanctifying                myself.  By  destroying  my  old  self  and  mortifying  my  bad                habits I will live a new life with Jesus Christ.                          Even though I am an unworthy priest, I recognize","that the sanctification I have to aspire is higher than the most                pious and holy laymen's sanctification, and I have to long for                it, making continuous effort to achieve it.                      To reach this perfection with the Lord's help, I will train                myself in the virtues as a true Christian, a true priest, and a                true Religious (Declarations of 1907).                      Besides facing troubles and torment, not answering the                divine call faces the risk of getting lost. St. Alphonsus, who is                a doctor of the Church, suggests that you should be cautious                about  speaking  of  your  vocation,  even  with  your  confessor.                Because  any  delay  may  expose  the  divine  call  to  risk,  he                recommends  that  you  follow  it  quickly.  He  quotes  a  holy                father's  saying:  «  To  be  quick,  instead  of  loosing  the  rope                fastening the boat to the beach, cut it ». In other words he is                saying: answer the call quickly, and leave the world.                      This  is  the  duty  of  those  who  are  called.  On  the  other                hand, the people who are responsible for receiving them have                the right to look into the matter, to delay, etc. For that reason,   27                before making the formal request for admittance to the order I                strongly  suggest  you  to  make  an  inner  steady  decision  of                embracing religious life along with its rules and sacrifices. To                belong totally to God and to be victim of his love, you need to                enter  religious  life  with  pure  intention  as  well  as  without                ulterior  motives,  you  must  be  convinced  that  being  a  true                Religious  means  dying  to  your  self  in  the  midst  of                contradictions,  inner  and  external  mortifications,  and  self                denial, it also means love of the cross, humiliation, and even                being put off, neglected, and not loved.                      Do  you  think  that  these  sacrifices  along  with  dying  to                your self are not the beginning of a true life and happiness?                Do you think that the Lord does not know how to recompense                his faithful servants and brides?","By entering the institute you have to leave off the « my                character,  »  the  «  I  cannot  stand  injustice,  »  the  «  I  would                break  rather  than  yielding,  »  and  the  like,  belonging  to  the                world and to vanity.                      If  there  is  no  sin,  you  shall  yield  to  and  through                everyone; you shall be silent, approving of what your superior                says, ever though you think that what he is saying is inexact;                you must become like a humble, malleable child.                      What a vast field you have for battling and winning with                the  divine  help  land  your  good  will!  What  a  difference                between these battles and the worldly battles and victories for                which the world praise you! And yet, you perhaps feared of                idling by entering the institute! It is written: « Better... a man                master of himself than one who takes a city » (Prov. 16, 32).                      In  this  great  battle  you  will  be  helped  by  exhortations,                warnings, prayers, good examples, as well as by mortification                and penance, tat you will receive and accept as a tender child                does.                                                     28                      In the presence of the new way of living, of the rules and                of  religious  discipline,  your  miseries,  defects,  bad  habits,                anger,  pride,  vanity,  attachment,  over-confidence,  etc.  will                stir, rise up, driving you to distrust, to react, to condemn, and                to turn back. Besides; something more horrible will happen:                the  devil  will  battle  tremendously,  will  stir  your  passions,                breaking  into  your  imagination,  bringing  sadness  and                boredom in your innermost self, filling you up with doubts; he                will make your life in the institute painful by exciting your pride                and by trying to overcome you by all means! Perhaps, he will                make use of an unobservant fellow! What will you do in such                situations? Don't you think that this battle will be harder than                those you would hive faced in he world?","I  am  foretelling  such  things  to  you  because  I  aim  at                helping  your  good  will,  not  at  disheartening  you.  You  will                overcome  these  tremendous  battles  by  being  completely                prepared,  humble  of heart,  determined,,  and  fond  of  Jesus.                Oh! how many things the love of Jesus teaches!                      As to food and its quality, do not mind, because we take                care of the youths' health; on the other hand, you will do your                best  to  get  used  to  the  community  food,  and  God  will  help                you. If special card is needed in some circumstances, it will                be  taken  with  pleasure  and  charity,  as  we  do  for  all  the                needy.  Besides,  you  have  to  surrender  yourself  to  divine                Providence! Be sure that our dearest daughters do not take                as much care of themselves as we do in order not to let them                decay (Letter, Oct. 13, 1909)!                      If you want to become a sister, I warn you, because I feel                that  your  call  is  not  a  true  vocation.  Indeed,  true  vocation                consists of being fond of humiliation, contempt, last position,                under the rule of obedience; these things are sweet, beautiful,                and  a  fountain  of  great  consolation  to  those  who  are  truly   29                called; on the contrary, they are disgusting to those who have                an imperfect vocation to religious life. If you were truly called                to a life of self-denial, to a life of destruction of your will and                mind, in a few words, to true religious life, you wouldn't have                taken my words amiss, you would not get discouraged, you                would  have  replied  in  the  affirmative  instead,  accepting  my                words and saying that you were ready to everything, etc.                      Blessed, dear daughter, God knows how dearly I paid for                having  distressed  you  with  my  previous  letter,  but  your                admittance in the religious community, without true signs of                perfect vocation, would have hunt you and my community.                          It may be that grace will overcome you later, and","the Lord will strongly call you to religious life through lave for                Jesus as a poor, humiliated, despised person, and longing to                imitate  him.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  is  the  essence  of                religious life (Letter, Feb. 14, 1910).                                  7. DIVINE PREDILECTION                      The  predestination  mystery  is  the  most  inscrutable                among  God's  mysteries.  The  human  mind  gets  lost  in                considering  both  the  mysterious  ways  through  which  God                leads  his  creatures  and  the  hidden  reasons  for  which  he                raises some people from the dust, while bringing others down                from their thrones. No created mind is able to fathom it (Par.                XXI,  96).  St.  Augustine  said:  «  Why  me  and  not  others?  »                Why did God single me out to be an object of his grace and                mercy?  And  yet,  the  predestination  mystery  is  as  profound                and inscrutable as certain. Putting aside the school questions                whether  predestination  occurs  before  or  after  the  foreseen                merits,  we  see  that  God  humiliates  same,  while  lifting  up                others;  raises  same,  bringing  others  dawn;  afflicts  some,   30                consoling others; impoverishes some, but making others rich;                calls same to glory, singling others out from the thousand to                destine  them  to  a  greater,  sublime  glory  without  depriving                human will of its rights nor contravening his unfailing justice                (Speech, April 27, 1888).                      What  a  grace  is  religious  vocation!  It  is  a  sign  of                predestination, which is not given to everyone! After the grace                of baptism, the greatest grace God gives a soul in his mercy                is the call to religious life. He could have chosen others, not                you. How many youths in the world are better than you, but                he did not call them! The Lord preferred you (Speech, April                25, 1920).                      Religious vocation is a priceless grace not only because                it offers great benefits and goads, but also because","it brings about a special predilection of God: it is the outcome                of  a  particular,  immense  love  that  moves  God  toward  a                person calling her to perfection in the religious life. When God                calls  a  person  to  religious  life,  such  a  person  is  an  elect                among  the  thousand  (Song  5,  10).  This  predilection  also                includes  a  particular  predestination;  God,  invites  the  person                as  He  did  with  the  apostles  and  disciples  when  He  said,  «                Follow me » (Speech, April 21, 1907).                      The holy gospel speaks of two Women (Mt. 24, 40) who                were busy with grinding grain: one of them was taken away,                the other was left behind. A great truth is concealed under the                obscure words of this brief parable.                      In  its  general  meaning  the  parable  shows  that  some                people  are  assumed  for  eternal  salvation,  but  others  are                abandoned  to  eternal  perdition.  The  mill  grinding  meal                represents the ceaseless work of the people Who earn their                living  in  order  to  meet  their  physical,  moral,  and  intellectual                needs: it is the work which earns material and spiritual bread.                                                                          31                     The gospel uses the singular for the plural, the individual                for  the  collective  in  this  parable.  Two  women,  one  is  taken                away, the other is abandoned; they represent those who are                saved,  and  those  who  tare  lost.  The  former  is  assumed  by                God  in  his  happy  kingdom,  the  latter  is  abandoned  to  the                power of Satan in the hellish abyss.                      In the particular meaning, this parable makes reference                to the liturgy we have just performed. Here, the two women                represent  two  different  groups:  the  laywomen  and  the                Religious. The woman God assumed is the youth God called                to  religious  life;  the  one  left  behind  is  the  woman  who                remained  in  the  world.  Gad  calls,  draws,  takes,  and  places                the former in his peaceful, rich house severing her from the                Babylon of the world: one is assumed.","The latter does not enjoy this predilection. She is left behind                in  the  world,  as  abandoned  to  the  stormy  human  fortunes:                one is left behind.                      My  dear,  you  see  how  lucky  you  are  for  having  been                called  by  God  to  religious  life,  whose  sacred  garb  you  took                today. So man youths, perhaps worthier than you, are not so                lucky,  for  God  did not  call  them;  but  He  called  you,  a  poor                creature, td such a singular favor... You were in the world as                a little boat in the open sea, exposed to the worldly risks, in                the midst of a thousand distractions, useless talks, dissipation                of spirit, unavoidable occasions of sin and defects. You were                working  in  the  mill,  busy  with  earning  your  material  and                spiritual bread. As the mill goes around grinding the meal, so                did your thoughts, because the powers of your soul had no                point of concentration and peace.                      Lo and behold! The merciful eyes of your Creator, who                redeemed your, with his precious blood, perched on you... He                who  sees,  the  humble  things  in  heaven  and  on  earth  (Ps.                112,  6)  looked  on  you  mercifully,  even  though  you  were   32                unworthy, of so a great honor. He made you feel the strong                call  of  vacation  saying: «  Follow  me! My  dear,  come  in  the                clefts of the rock, in the coverts of the cliff (Song. 2, 14), I will                marry you on faith. »                      Oh call, oh vocation, oh singular d4vine wedding! Let the                luckiest woman in the world come here to see whether she                may  compare  her  luck  with  yours!  Let  the  prettiest,  richest,                noblest, the most powerful married couples, either primes or                kings  or  emperors  came  here  to  see  whether  their  may                compare their groom with the groom who called you, offering                his love to you and inviting you to his wedding. The bride of                the Song replies to this: « As an apply tree among the trees                of the orchard, so is my Beloved among  the young men »                (Song of Solomon 2, 3).","Compared  with  the  celestial  groom,  Jesus,  the  terrestrial                grooms are wild, fruitless tries good for nothing but to burn to                ashes. In the words of the prophet Jesus is the most beautiful                among men; his beauty is unbeatable, because it is infinite;                his  voice  is  more  melodious  than  the  angels',  and  one                intonation,  one  of  his  word makes the  soul melt:  «  my  soul                melted when he spoke » (Song of Solomon 5, 6). He is the                richest, the most powerful groom because heaven and earth                are made by his word.                      Jesus  is  the  most  faithful  groom:  the  Lord  has  sworn,                and he will not repent (Heb. 7, 21). When he gives himself to                a soul, when he chooses a soul as his bride, he never leaves                her, but he fills her to overflowing with new favors and new                gifts,  on  condition  that  the  soul  remains  faithful.  Dearest                daughter,  please  meditate  on  your  good  fortune,  continue                looking at this picture. Today you got married to Jesus, who is                the king of 'eternal glory. Here we have not the splendor, the                riches, the superb coaches and palaces, the visits of ladies                anti  gentlemen,  as  it  happens  when  a  noble  woman  gets                married in the world. We have quite the opposite! Legions of   33                angels,  brightest  spirits,  witnessed  your  mystical  weeding,                singing the Idyll of this divine wedding and playing the golden                harps, While the celestial Jerusalem was rejoicing. The happy                spirits  of  the  celestial  court  kept  company  with  the  divine                groom, who told you in the shadow of faith: come, my bride.                      The  Queen  of  Angels  and  Saints,  the  mother  of  your                divine  groom  attended  the  celestial  meting.  If  any  bride                becomes  somehow  daughter  of  the  groom's  mother,  you,                who  were  daughter  of  the  most  holy  Virgin  for  so  many                reasons,  become  her  daughter  for  an  additional,  particular,                intimate reason: now she regards you along with","Jesus, her divine Son and your groom, as though you formed                one person!                      Gifts, golden or silver jewels or diamonds shining for a                short  time,  precede  the  terrestrial  weddings;  later  they  are                kept in a coffer at mercy of time, rust, and perhaps thieves.                Your celestial groom's gifts are unlike these. You can number                them  from  the  words  of  the  virgin  St.  Agnes,  who  was                enraptured  by  joy  for  the  mystical  wedding  with  the                Immaculate Lamb and exclaimed: « He girded my right hand                and my neck with jewels, adding priceless pearls to my ears.                He put the faith ring in my finger adorning me with so many                necklaces. »                      Dearest  daughter,  these  are  the  gifts  you  are  adorned                with  by  your  celestial  groom.  The  groom's  friends...  the                angels, the saints, and their Queen Mary also offer their gifts.                If you could see this mystery with your eyes, you would see                the  saints,  the  angels,  the  Patriarch  St.  Joseph,  and  Mary                busy with your good; same of them praying, others obtaining                graces, same others getting more favors, and your guardian   34                angel  whispering  at  the  ears  of  your  soul  his  best                congratulations for your good fortune!                      Now you are so rich, so beautiful, and so noble that the                beauty, the nobility, and the power of the woman who was left                behind in the world, at the mercy of the mundane wealth, are                dust  and  mud  compared  with  your  good  luck  (Speech,  St.                Joseph, 1908)!                       (1) Prayer to the most holy Virgin. O most loving mother, please help us                take  the  holy  garb  with  your  consent  and  blessing  as  well  as  with  the                powerful  grace of the most holy Heart of Jesus in the  Sacrament. We are                going to put on the holy garb with profound humility and holy fervor. Please                help us wear it till our last breath in order to grow in your divine love, in holy                observance, and in pure zeal for the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests (May                6, 1917).","CHAPTER II                                ROGATIONIST VOCATION                     I declare that I felt a particular devotion to this pious                institute and that I chose it not only for my own upright                reasons  but  also  for  the  following  ones:  because  it                commits  itself  to  the  finest  works  of  spiritual  and                temporal  charity  such  as  the  rescue  of  abandoned                orphans,    evangelization   and   assistance   to   the                unprivileged  classes,  and  because  this  institute  is                perhaps the only one in the Church which is committed                to the sublime mission of carrying out the command of                Jesus: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest that                he will send out workers to gather in his harvest. »                     Through the vow obedience to this divine command                of the Heart of  Jesus' divine zeal, the institute commits                itself  to  pray  in  order  to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy                Church and to continuously spread all over the word the                vocation prayer, which is called Evangelical Rogation of   35                the Heart of Jesus.                     I recognize that a great deal of good for the Church                and for the people may come from the faithful obedience                to this divine command and from the propagation of the                Evangelical  Rogation.  Such  a  prayer  may,  incline  the                merciful God to look favorably on this least institute, on                condition  that  its  members  answer  this  particular                vocation, with the help of grace and with good will.                     I  also  acknowledge  and  declare  that  both  my                vocation to this institute and the benign admittance the                superiors have conceded to me depend on a particular,                merciful,  undeserved  grace  of  the  Lord;  therefore  I  am                grateful to divine goodness and to my superiors' charity.","1. THE ROGATIONIST IDEA                      At the beginning of his spiritual life and before knowing                these divine words of Jesus: « Pray, therefore, to the owner                of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in his                harvest, » a youth was immersed in the predominant thought                of increasing elect priests, hdlg and apostolic men according                to the Heart of Jesus by winning them from God through an                insistent  prayer.  He  felt  that  such  a  prayer  was  the  best                means  to  work  a  greater  good  in  the  holy  Church,  to  save                many souls, and to expand the kingdom of God on earth as it                happened  in  the  times  of  St.  Dominic,  St.  Francis,  St.                Ignatius, St. AIphonsus, etc.                      For this youth, this idea was clear and unquestionable.                      Later he was amazed and absorbed after reading these                divine words in the gospel: « There is a large harvest, but few                workers to gather it in. Pray to the owner of the harvest that                he will send out workers to gather in his harvest » (Mt. 9, 37).   36                When he became a priest, he deemed that the foundation of                a male and a female order that would commit themselves by                vow  of  obedience  to  the  command  of  Jesus:  «  Pray,                therefore... », would please the Heart of Jesus and the most                holy Virgin, besides being a fountain of great benefits.                      The Orders should be committed to the following three                concerns:                      1. To pray every day to the adorable Heart of Jesus, the                most holy Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, the angels, and the saints                to  win  numerous  holy  priests  and  workers  (1)  for  the  holy                Church, for the people and the nations of the world, and to                win  extraordinary  holy  vocations  for  the  seminaries,  the                religious orders, and the dioceses.","2. To widely spread the spirit of this prayer all over the                world in honor and in compliance with the divine command.                      3. To be workers of the mystical harvest for the spiritual                and  temporal  good  of  the  people  within  the  sphere  of  their                activity.                      Following  this  fixed  idea  the  poor  priest  examined  the                religious communities and the religious orders existing in the                Church,  as  well  as  those  that  were  being  formed;  he  was                amazed that no religions order had picked up that divine word                from the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ; that command had                almost passed unnoticed.                      After  reflecting  on  the  gospel  he  seasoned  that  these                words are words of Jesus Christ arid of supreme importance,                and they are a command of his divine Heart's zeal and are                proposed  as  an  infallible  remedy  for  the  salvation  of  the                Church  and  society.  Consequently  that  priest  -  may  God                forgive  his  daring,  -  began  forming  the  two  religious  orders                that  are  bound  by  vow  to  carry  out  the  divine  command   37                through the three concerns mentioned above.                      Several  years  have  passed  since'  he  began  forming                these orders.                      The male order consists of a few priests, brothers, and                young  students  who  are  candidates  for  the  priesthood  or                religious  life.  They  are  called  Rogationists  of  the  Heart  of                Jesus;  this  name  originates  from  the  Latin  word  Rogate,                which means to pray.                      The  female  order  consists  of  sisters  who  are  called                Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus, because the                divine  command  to  pray  for  vocations  originated  from  the                Heart of Jesus' zeal.                      These Religious wear a badge with a red heart printed","on it reading, « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest                that  he  will  send  out  workers  to  gather  in  his  harvest  »  (2)                (Rules for founders, etc.).                      You have picked up from the adorable mouth of Jesus                Christ and from his divine Heart these words, which hold the                secret of he peoples' and the nations' salvation: « Pray to the                owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in                his harvest. » Two Evangelists have registered these words                in  the  gospel.  Thousand  of  religious  orders  have  devoutly                studied  the  divine  book  singling  out  a  verse,  a  saying,  a                command, a counsel, choosing them as the foundation stone                of  their  rules,  but  it  seems  as  though  our  Lord  Jesus  had                concealed that sublime word, that  command under his hand,                and no one noticed it until our adorable Savior revealed it to                the poorest among his creatures. He showed it, made it re-                sound in your ears, had it printed in your heart and on your                chest along with his wounded, blazing heart.                      Oh!  Please  profit  by  such  a  great  and  inexpressible   38                predilection. Make' use of it incessantly; lift up your implorant                hands to haven and wail so that heaven unfold; pour out the                just, end let the earth blossom the saviors. Wave this sacred                banner;  the  more  you  raise  to  the  owner  of  the  mystical                harvest  this  prayer  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  commanded,                preserved for our times, and entrusted to you, the mare the                good  evangelical  workers  will  increase  on  earth  and  the                mystical harvest of souls will be saved.                      Sublime, diving is the mission that the free distributor of                his gifts entrusted to you. If you are faithful, it will draw the                blessings  of  God  and  of  humankind  upon  you  (Speech,  St.                Joseph, 1908).","2. THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES                      Living together under a rule of holy charity, in obedience,                poverty, and chastity as our Lord Jesus Christ counseled, the                saints practiced, and the Church ratified, is a great means of                sanctification. This union brings many benefits: it helps us to                carry  out  God's  aim,  to  fulfill  His  divine  will,  to  do  good  for                ourselves and others, to be holy and to attain salvation.                      The  world  understood  both  this  truth  and  need,  and                invented the saying, « union is strength. » Hence societies,                administrations, companies, and factories... developed. If the                world forms these associations in order to attain a temporal                goal, with greater reason those having more important goals                are bound in duty to reach them by forming community.                      Applying the saying, « union is strength » , we say: union                of souls living together with religious vows and mutual love in                the  service  of  God  is  a  great,  powerful,  spiritual,  invincible                strength.  A  community  of  faithful  followers  of  the  rule  is  a                strength,  a  bastion,  a  company  which  battles  with  spiritual   39                weapon, gaining plenty of victories!                      This spiritual power is based on Jesus' saying: « Where                two  or  three  gather  together  in  my  name,  I  am  there  with                them » (Mt. 18, 20). If Jesus Christ is with us, does it matter                that  we  are  few?  Not  at  all.  This  kind  of  fortress  does  not                depend  on  numbers.  Jesus  Christ  said  that  two  or  three                persons who gather in his name, who are strict followers of                his word, who are lovers of him, are enough! He is with them!                      Oh! What a great consolation this statement brings to us!                We are a little, an insignificant flock, but Christ is saying to us,                « Do not be afraid, little flock (Lc. 12, 32; as long as you are                with me, I am with you! »  And if God","is with us, who  can be against (Ram. 8. 31)? (Speech, April                21, 1925).                      By  committing ourselves  to  the  service  of our  Lord,  by                pleasing  him  in  everything,  by  glorifying  him  through  our                sanctification and the sanctification of our neighbor, we draw                God's  continuous  blessings  upon  the  institute  and  the                communities, which will grow from nothing, becoming fruitful                trees in the holy Church. To be specific, with all my heart I                exhort  you  to  beware  of  any  sin,  even  the  least  one!  If  by                human weakness or by surprise, a person happens to sin or                to  be  at  fault,  she  must  not  became  disheartened  or  lose                confidence, following the devil's suggestion; on the contrary,                with quiet humility and pious confidence she must rise, beg                pardon  from  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  whose  mercy  is                infinite, apply a remedy (if it is necessary), go to confession,                and recommence the practice of virtues with renewed energy,                always  imploring  God's  help.  Thus,  the  soul  groves  in  the                holy fear of Gad, who is the foundation of all wisdom, since                no  wisdom  is  better  than  the  one  that  prevents  us  from                offending God, even in the least (Letter, Feb. 13, 1922).   40                      Blessed daughters, you see how many small trees are                rising in the Church of our Lord; they take different shapes,                but all of them are beautiful. They give new  fruits for Jesus                and souls... Who knows whether divine mercy wants to bless                this seed, this little grain, making it grow in the holy Church's                garden!  Due  to  my  sins  and  defects,  I  am  unworthy  of  so                much; you, however, pray the Lord to continue giving you the                means of sanctification that he has granted until now.                      If you zealously practice holy virtues, especially the daily                little ones; if you love your rule, your name, and","your emblem, we have ground to hope that the little seed will                fructify.                      Pray  to  the  Lord  of  the  harvest:  this  is  your  emblem.                Persevere praying to him, letting the spirit of this prayer grow                in you, for it is fecund, and will produce much good. Those                who  win  good  workers  to  the holy  Church will  be  rewarded                (Letter, May 13, 1889).                         3. RULE BOTH FLEXIBLE... AND RIGOROUS                      I accept the two postulants you proposed... However, I                let you know that I am going to put them to the test, with your                approval,  because  we  must  be  sure  that  they  are  apt  and                have the vocation for the regular discipline. A person may be                a  pious,  good,  devout,  excellent  woman,  and  at  the  same                time  she  may  be  unqualified  far  a  religious community,  still                less  for  a  nascent  community,  Where  the  sacrifices  are                double. Likewise double are the merits of the first members,                who are like the foundresses.                             41                      Even  though  my  institute's  rule  is  not  rigorous,  we  are                seriously concerned about obedience, respect and subjection                to  the  superior,  education  and  mutual  fine  manners,  and                exact fulfillment of one's own duty. We require that the youths                be detached from everything, even from personal devotions,                being ready for self-denial. In short, the rule is moderate in its                external  penance,  but  it  is  severe  about  the  formation  of                interior  virtues.  We  inform  the  candidates  for  religious  lift                about  it  beforehand,  because  being  dismissed  for  lack  of                observance  is  painful  for  a  postulant  who  has  entered  the                institute with fervor: furthermore, their leaving often results in                prejudice to the institute, because the former candidates say                that they were not to blame for their leaving (of course!), but it                was  the  fault  of  the  institute,  Which  made  it  impossible  to                remain. Thus, vocations are discouraged.","Experience  has  taught  me  all  this;  so,  when  the  pos-                tulants request admission into the order I meet with them and                question them so as to form an idea from the whole. I am not                appeased by their so many declarations and promises. It is                obvious that we can be mistaken; far this reason we receive                the  petitioners  for  one  year  as  aspirants,  another  year  as                postulants, and two more years as novices (Letter, Aug. 28,                1902).                                   4. ROGATIONIST VOW                      This  year,  Jesus  in  the  Holy  Sacrament  will  teach  you                another thing. Last year he taught you how to live as faithful                subjects in his little kingdom, giving you the gift of persevering                in his service, when others abandoned it. His title being the                Highest Pontiff (3) this year, he will teach you how to fulfill the                great mission of winning good workers far the holy Church.                Our Lord Jesus Christ is so kind and merciful that he entrusts                you,  who  are  humble  and  poor  creatures,  with  this  sacred,                sublime task. Really, it is a divine mission! The point is that a   42                miserable  little  poor  creature  becomes  a  mother  of                innumerable souls; furthermore, she reaches a greater glory                by spiritually begetting priests to the holy Church!                      I  feel  myself  confused,  full  of  admiration  toward  divine                goodness!  It  has  been  since  yesterday  that  I  am  being                enlightened  about  your  vocation.  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's                command: « Pray, therefore » , etc., which adorns your poor                garb of Little Poor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, shows the                aim of your vacation. You must pray to win the good workers                for the holy Church, and work to win them... We will not be                satisfied  by  prayer  alone,  so  we  will  combine  work  with                prayer:  we  will  combine  prayer  with  an  active  life,  always                aiming at winning good workers far the holy Church.","My  dear  daughters,  the  most  beautiful  field  of  perfect,                charitable works is open before you. If the good Jesus does                not look an my sins, but blesses you, your vocation is formed                and  the  zeal  is  heady,  the  zeal  for  the  interests  of  Jesus'                Heart who demands prayer to win good workers for the holy                Church,  which  farms  the  fourth  vow.  «  The  zeal  of  your                house, God, burns in me like a fire » (John 2, 17).                      Whether contemplating or working, the Little Poor of the                Heart of Jesus will be always aware of this aim. In the choir                she  will  implore  God  to  send  out  goad  workers  to  the  hilly                Church; in her teaching the orphans, she will teach the prayer                for winning the good workers; in her begging she will wear on                her chest ,the badge reading, « Pray, therefore, to the owner                of  the  harvest  »;  and  when  people  ask  the  meaning  of  the                reading, she will explain it and spread the vocation prayer.                      The Little Poor of the Heart of Jesus will do more: taking                from  her  collection  of  alms  end  from  her  work  only  what  is                necessary to live a really poor life, she will use the surplus to                help the needy clerics and to form the sacred patrimonies for   43                them.  (4)  Really,  this  is  a  divine  mission  and  a  great                revelation that the most holy Heart of Jesus has given to four                or five prior creatures in his mercy and charity.                      Blessed daughters, this is the enlightenment about your                vacation  that  the  Lord  gave  me  I  yesterday,  after  so  many                years of darkness, while we were dedicating the title Highest                Pontiff to him, who is the eternal chief of the priests.                      Now I have nothing else to say to you but to exhort you                to pray always so that we may Meet the divine will perfectly                (Letter, July 2, 1888).","5. BUILDING STONES, NOT ROOM FURNITURE                       The divine Hearts of Jesus and Mary long for generous                souls.                      Forming a religious community is an effective means to                foster God's glory and the salvation of souls. Because union                is strength, the formation of a religious community makes hell                shudder, but the angels rejoice. When a religious community                is formed, the first vocations are like the building stones, and                the first members are, neither more nor less, the foundresses                of the religious institute, sharing in the goad the institute will                accomplish in the future (Letter, March 25, 1913).                      Unfortunately, vocations usually happen to be opposed;                but when it concerns a nascent institute, opposition is more                passionate and more arrogant through various pretexts such                as saying that the institute is not yet formed, that its future is                uncertain,  and  the  like.  The  people  arguing  in  such  a  way                forget that no institute is perfectly formed at its beginning, that   44                the institute needs good vocations to be formed, and that they                are working against the formation of the institute by opposing                vocations. Joining a nascent religious institute sometimes is                more  deserving  thin  joining  a  formed  one;  indeed,  the  first                members  are  like  the  first  building  stones.  They  are  the                founders of the order; they beforehand prepare the institute's                future  glory.  Through  their  work  and  sacrifice  they  lay  the                foundation  stones,  preparing  the  treasure  of  grace  for  the                following members! Oh, if the people pondered on this matter,                many  candidates  for  religious  life  would  prefer  a  nascent                institute to a formed one, provided that good dedication and                holy  aim  are  sure  (On  Fr.  Bonarrigo's  death;  «  God  and                Neighbor », March 1910).                      The people who joined a nascent community in the","period of its foundation are the building stones, not the roam                furniture. Since their sacrifice is nobler, their merit is double                before the Lord; in fact, they prepare the salvation-home for                the  future  members  by  building  the  ship  that  will  save  so                many  people.  Any  community  which  is  formed  had  this                beginning and these foundresses. At its starting each institute                had  generous  persons  who  did  not  say  that  the  community                was unworthy of their trust because it was a nascent one, or                that it was better for them to choose a formed community. I                Had the first vocations reasoned so, the community would be                never formed. Therefore those who had faith and courage to                love,  and  who  joined  the  unknown  or  perhaps  despised                community, were the foundresses; their name an memory will                last as a blessing in the institute.                      Now then, here is the nascent, new-born community that                comes  forth  in  the  Church  with  this  name:  Daughters  of                Divine  Zeal.  The  institute  already  enjoys  the  most  elect                blessings from the sacred prelates of the holy Church. But the                community  needs  vocations:  to  grow!  It  needs  generous,                intelligent people who understand not only the sacred mission   45                of charity toward their neighbor, but also the divine word that                makes the institute unique and singular: « Pray, therefore... »                (Letter, without date.                      Let us remember the institution at its very beginning, the                long period of work, want, and sacrifices as it is common at                the beginning of such enterprises. More than ever it is at its                beginning that the institute needs generous people who are                willing to immolate themselves for divine glory, with faith and                courage,  daring  to  be  the  foundation  stones  of  the  building                that  the  omnipotent  arm  of  God  wants  to  raise.  Devoting                oneself to the Lord in a religious order that is already formed                is easy; but asking for admittance to a nascent order that is","nothing but an effort, an impulse of faith, a longing for, and an                interlacing  of  hard  difficulties,  is  hard.  Only  a  singular,                generous,  priceless  vocation  does  that.  The  first  vocations                are  not  fellows,  but  foundresses.  How  marvelous  are  the                ways of Providence! Such souls are needed at the beginning                of an institute, when nearly all the vocations shun and avoid it                (Speech, Aug. 16, 1926). (5)                               6. I AM BLACK BUT BEAUTIFUL                      Our least institute lacks the saint founder (6) - mystery of                God!  -  However,  our  Lord  himself  seems  to  have                accomplished everything from the time he printed the divine                word. « Pray, therefore! » - hidden in the gospel for so many                centuries - on the forehead of this nascent institute, by a flash                of his infinite goodness.                      This least institute can say: I am black but beautiful. I am                black because of the starter who hindered my progress and                because  of  the  contradictions  surrounding  me;  but  I  am   46                beautiful because of the shining reflection of the command of                Jesus' divine zeal, the ceaseless wail oaf the prayer that I am                spreading widely everywhere, and the most holy longing for                seeing  the  holy  Church  rich  with  workers  according  to  the                heart  of  God.  I  am  beautiful  for  the  Sacred  Alliance  of  so                many prelates of the holy Church, who bless me copiously,                offering me to God during the sacrifice of the mass; at last I                am beautiful because of the orphans I am rescuing, and the                poor I aim feeding and evangelizing.                      But  so  that  the  fire may  continue  burning,  it  needs  fire                (Letter, March 25, 1913)!                      I  am  black,  because  of  the  contradictions...  Everyone                knows  the  serious  difficulties  opposing  the  Lord's  works;                humanly  speaking,  these  difficulties  sometimes  seem  in-                superable.","The person who starts such institutions has to fight four                battles:                      1.  He  has  to  fight against  those  who  oppose  him,  and                the external oppositions such as censures, persecutions, and                disapprovals sometimes coming from good people. Some of                them  say  that  the  person  starting  such  institutions  is  mad;                others say that the work will came to nothing with his death,                while  the  lack  of  resources,  want,  defections,  ingratitude,  a                hundred difficulties, and vicissitudes make matters worse.                      2. The starter has to fight with himself. He grows feeble,                seems  to  fail,  sees  the  enterprise  as  though  it  were                unattainable  owing  to  his  spiritual  weakness.  On  the  other                hand,   the   enterprise   requires,   strength,   sacrifice,                perseverance,  faith,  confidence,  sacred  enthusiasm,  want,                tolerance, prudence, longanimity, and dissimulation; in short,                self-denial is to be practiced at any moment.                      3. Meanwhile one fighter is battling by day and by night,                extrinsically  and  intrinsically,  by  means  of  other  human   47                beings and our own passions: he is Satan! The battle against                the  power  of  darkness  is  so  hard  and  tremendous  that  the                apostle St. Paul aid: « For we are not fighting against human                beings, but against the wicked spiritual forces in the heavenly                world, the rulers, authorities, and cosmic powers of this dark                ale » (Eph. 6, 12).                      Satan fears nothing else as much as the foundation of a                charitable  or  religious  institution  which  aims  at  God's  glory                and salvation of souls. Such a foundation for him, is like the                foundation  of  the  Church:  the  anger  and  the  fury  which                blinded him at the Church's birth return. What doesn't hell try                to  preclude  the  foundation  of  such  institutes?  To  resist and                overcome  the  hellish  powers,  people  need  to  provide                themselves with God's help, the","weapons  of  faith,  Christian  wisdom,  prayer,  pure  intention,                honest conscience, and wise counsels.                      4.  But  a  very  surprising  battle  defies  the  institute's                starter: it is the battle Jacob fought with the angel, with God.                Even though the founder is nothing else but a weak, useless                tool, since only God is the author of any good work, still God                works on with this tool! But He wants immolation, and Jesus                wants us to imitate him. Our Savior fought with the justice of                his eternal Father when « he made his prayers and requests                with loud cries and tears to God » (Heb. 5, 7). He did so all                his life long, on the mountains and in the graves, immolating                himself on the altar of his divine heart. In his terrible agonies,                he prayed even more fervently (Lc. 22, 43); so did he while                combining  his  blood  with  his  burning  tears  until  his  last                breath. The prophet had foretold: « Would anyone plead his                cause? Yes, he was torn away from the  land of the living »                (Is. 53, 8).                       God  shapes  the  institute  and  its  members  through                privation,  wails,  sobs,  and  sacrifice;  with  one  hand  he   48                sustains the feeble tool, with the other he trains the tool for                the fight; with one hand he gives the necessary help, with the                other he bars additional help, often blocking the way with cut                stoned  as  the  prophet  Jeremiah  complained:  «  He  has                blacked my ways with cut stones, he has obstructed my paths                » (Jer. Lam. 3, 9).                      In  the  midst  of  these  troubles  man  comes  to  know  his                inability, his nothingness; he begins to distrust, to humiliate,                and debase himself; he realizes that he is an obstacle to any                good,  and  as  Moses,  he  perhaps  implores,  «  Lord,  send                anyone you will » (Ex. 4, 13). All paths seem closed. Heaven                seems defiant, a thousand doubts call in question the work,                as  an  output  of  foolhardiness  and  over-confidence,  even                prayer seems useless.","God  seems  to  have  withdrawn  himself  in  order  to  punish                infidelity,  interposing  a  cloud  so  that  prayer  may  not  reach                him. According to the prophet Jeremiah's saying: « You have                wrapped yourself in  a cloud too thick for prayer to pierce »                (Jer. Lam. 3, 44 ). And yet, that is the proper time to wail and                sob  before  divine  mercy  from  the  profound  abyss  of  one's                own misery, « for we do not know how we ought to pray; the                Spirit  himself  pleads  with  God  for  us,  in  groans  that  words                cannot express » (Rom. 8, 26).                      That is the time to uphold God's wise delays: « Cling to                him and do not leave him » (Eccl. 2, 3); this is the proper time                to endure the mysterious battle for self annihilation, the time                of wails, sobs, petitions, and any sacrifice so that these wards                of  the  Psalmist,  «  put  your  hope  in  Yahweh,  be  strong,  let                your heart be bold » (Ps. 27, 14) may come true.                      At  last,  the  fight  with  the  angel  finds  with  a  strong                embrace, but Jacob states, « I will not let you go, unless you                bless  me  »  (Gen.  32,  26).  The  event  comes  to  terms  with                copious, divine blessings, which re as much abundant as long   49                and hard is the mysterious fight.                      It  was  God  who  was  planting,  not  people  (Precious                Adhesions, pages 6-8).                      The  four  difficulties,  which  surrounded  this  little  char-                itable institute since its start, have been growing, always with                more  complication  of  things  ands  the  interlacing  of                circumstances. The institute has been surrounded by a vortex                of tribulations which brought it at the point of death a hundred                times  before  being  completely  born.  How  many  times  I  felt                myself exclaiming, « the waters went over my head; I said: I                am lost » (Jer. Lam. 3, 54)... We continued sailing in the open                sea in the midst of light and darkness when, in a few years,                besides lack of resources,","desertions,  and  misunderstanding,  the  tide  of  the  torments,                oppositions,  and  difficulties  climbed  so  high  that  the                shipwreck  seemed  impending  and  unavoidable.  I  said  with                the prophet: « have stepped into deep water and the waves                are  washing  over  me  »  (Ps.  69,  2).  (Precious  Adhesions,                1903, pages 6-8).                      By grace of God, faith began to prevail. I said: if we seek                God and immolate ourselves far the good of souls, for good                results, far sanctification, and salvation, the Lord will provide                for  everything.  Piety,  prayer,  meditation,  work,  special  and                effective  devotions,  which  we  label  devout,  new,  singular,                fecund industries, were the pious institute's great resources in                those  events.  We  hope  that  they  will  continue  (Precious                Adhesions, page 6).                      When everything in our enterprises seems to be upside                down,  the  only  comfort  is  submission  to  divine  will,  which                guides  everything  to  good  results,  even  though  we  do  not                understand. The people who have experienced it known how                dearly  one  pays  for  being  submissive.  In  my  case  a   50                circumstance  made  the  cup  more  bitter;  I  had  to  submit                myself  to  the  idea  of  losing  the  aim  of an  institute  which  is                committed  to  the  most  holy,  celestial  command:  «  Pray,                therefore »; I had to refold the sacred banner which makes                the most holy Heart of Jesus' tender utterance shine and to                which the salvation of souls is very likely connected through                the  shortest,  surest  way  (Preface  to  Precious  Adhesions,                1903).                      If  this  community  along  with  the  whole  institute  did  not                go to ruin; if the little plant tossed by the storm still exists, it is                mostly due to some faithful people who practiced holy virtues                with perseverance, giving assistance and obeying for Jesus'                sake.  The  Lord  requires  many  sacrifices  in  this  pious                institute's foundation, owing perhaps to its great destiny!","Blessed  daughters,  meantime  you  rouse  your  spirit,                attend to your sanctification, be zealous for divine glory and                salvation of souls, praying fervently to win the good workers                to  the  holy  Church  and  being  sure  that  Jesus  Christ  will                comfort and console you (Letter, Sept. 9, 1888).                                           NOTES                     1   «  Asking  God  for  sending  out  workers  to  the  holy  Church                means imploring that he send priests according to his heart as well                as  male  and  female  Religious,  lay  people  full  of  God’s  spirit  and                zealous for the salvation of souls. For instance, it is obvious that the                following  people  are  holy  workers  in  the  mystical  harvest:  the                educators of youth; parents taking care of their children's Christian                and civil education, wealthy persons investing money for God's glory                and the goad of souls, Catholic journalists fighting for holy religion                within  proper  limits,  any  one  cooperating  with  funds  or  prayer  or                individual holiness for Gads glory and the goad of souls. »                     2   Here  our  padre  is  simplifying  and  synthesizing;  in  fact,  we                know how many sorrows he endured and how many tears he shed   51                for  the  foundation  of  the  twin  orders;  even  their  names  were  the                outcome  of  long  reflections  and  prayers  (See  VITALE,  «  Fr.  M.                Hannibal Di Francia etc. », pages 154-155).                     3  This Is the Eucharistic title of 1888; in 1887 the title was King.                     4  Our  padre  was  writing  in  1888,  when  the  Rogationists  order                was not yet born.                     5  Obviously, now our orders are not at their start any longer, but                if we  are  faithful  and  generous, the  grace  of the beginning  will  be                also granted to us. Let us read St. Theresa's idea on this topic: « I                often hear some people say that at the religious orders' beginning                God granted more graces to the saints founders. That is true; how-                ever, we cannot help realizing that the living are the foundation of                the new generations. If we and our successors will imitate the fervor                of the previous Religious, the institute will always stand firm. Does                the predecessors' holiness matter to me, if I am so miserable as to                ruin  the  house  through  my  bad  habits?  It  is  obvious  that  the  new                comers  follow  more  the  pattern  of  those  who  are  living  than  the                pattern of those who are dead. It's odd putting the blame on the","fact that I am not one of thè first! Why don't I  think of my lite and                virtues  as  being  very  far  from  thè  lite  and  virtues  of  those  who                received sueh graces? » (Foundations, chapter IV, n. 6).                         (6)      No    one    wilI      bave    himself    deceived      by    our                padre's   own testimony. He is speaking of himself, but... no one ìs a                judge fori himself!                         (7)   You can  imagine how much thè enemy of any  good                was displeased by seeing thè great word picked up from thè gospel                and submitted to  thè attention  of thè Christian people  as well  as                by  seeing  two    religious    orders    committed  to  thè    most    holy                mission of spreading  it and  making thè people  know,  love, artd                obey  thè  divine  command.  Furthermore,  to  fulfill    this  divine                command  these  Religious  take  a  speciffc  vow,  praying  fervently                every day in order to win from divine mercy copious and holy priests                to  thè  Church!  Satan  sees  thè  beginning  of  his  kingdom's                destruction in thè spreading of this divine prayer commànded by our                Lord Jesus Christ. This is thè why beli hurled itself on these humble                institutions!  Persecu-tions    fell    upon      us  from      everywhere!

Humility  of  heart.  Through  the  practice  of  this                virtue  I  will  be  always  aware  of  being  nothing,  and  the                last among the order's fellow-members.                     2. Constant practice of divine presence and love. The                only  aim  in  my  actions  and  life  will  be  Jesus:  loving                Jesus as much as he deserves, sighing for him, pleasing                him in everything, and belonging to Jesus with the most                fervent  love,  and  with  the  perfect  union  of  his  and  my                will. Through lively faith I will contemplate Jesus in the                Innermost depth of my heart where he dwells, urges me     53                to  love  him,  asks  for  love,  attracts  me,  longs  for  being                one  with  me,  and  grieves  so  much  every  time  I  do  not                make up for my faults.                     I  will  listen  to  him  talking  in  my  spirit,  asking  for                souls, and for sacrifice out of love for him and for souls.                By only pronouncing the name of Jesus I will be aware of                his  presence.  It  will  revive  my  motives  to  love  him  by                recalling  to  mind  the  following:  that  he  created,                redeemed,  and  called  me;  that  he  has  granted  me  so                many  favors;  that  I  belong  to  him  as  a  priest.  While                pronouncing  or  hearing  the  sweetest  name  of  Jesus,  I                will also bow my head.                     3. After Jesus and in Jesus I will love his most holy                mother, whose devotion forms a particular characteristic                of this pious Institute, to my great consolation.","1. INTERIOR VIRTUE                         The rules are norms governing the external actions;                but  unless  they  are  joined  by  interior  life,  external  actions                alone are of little avail.                         The aspirant must have an upright, pure intention of                achieving  his  own  sanctification  for  God's  glory  and  the                salvation of souls. He will be living in the presence of God,                having Jesus Christ in his mind, in his heart, in his actions, in                his words, and in his desires. Belonging totally to Jesus will                be the only aim of the aspirant's life.                         To  achieve  this  goal,  the  aspirant  must  carefully                beware of  any  sin,  hating  either the mortal or  venial  one  in                order to avoid causing grief to the most holy Heart of Jesus                (R.A.).                         Because  external  observance  of  the  rules  cannot                endure  without  internal  virtue,  each  congregant  will  seek  to                attain  spiritual  union  with  God.  They  will  endeavor  to  be   54                always  in  his  presence  and  to  please  him  entirely  by doing                everything  for  Jesus,  and  by  seeking  God alone  with  virtue                and pure intention. It is necessary to be a person of prayer                and penance, meditating on the adorable Lord Jesus Christ                every day, mortifying the senses especially those of gluttony                and hearing, keeping external and internal silence, and being                detached from everything and everybody; even from oneself                (C.R.).                         To faithfully fulfill the Rogate's divine command and                to become worthy of propagating it, we must work toward our                own  sanctification  by  practicing  evangelical  and  priestly                virtues, by regular observance and discipline, and by prayer                and  spiritual  reading.  To  became  spiritual persons  we  must                mortify  our  sensual  self  sedulously,  doing  our  utmost  to                achieve internal virtue and the pure intention of pleasing God                alone, to be detached from any earthly","affection,  and  to  devote  ourselves  entirely  to  the  love  of                Jesus. Love for Jesus must be our alpha and omega.                      While asking the Lord to send out good workers to the                holy  Church,  we  first  must  be  good  workers  in  the mystical                harvest by looking after our sanctification, the sanctification of                the  people,  and  their  goodness.  As  the  elect  priesthood  of                Jesus Christ in the world wish God's glory and the good of all                the people, so also shall we do (R.R.C.).                      Dearest  daughters,  I  recommend  you  to  answer  the                grace of the Lard, who is calling you to holiness. He is calling                you to belong totally to Jesus, and to become the first stones                of the building that he is raising. Because God makes use of                poor,  weak  tools,  He  chose  you,  the  poor;  but  if  someone                does not answer the call faithfully and humbly, He will reject                her,  choosing  a  faithful  one.  Please  live  in  the  holy  fear  of                God:  be  submissive  to  all,  all  of  you  be  submissive  to  the                superiors as representatives of the most holy Virgin by loving                and  trusting  them,  by  being  united  in  perfect  charity  and                sympathy, each one accomplishing her own duty. Read and   55                observe the rules, leaving out no prayer nor spiritual reading.                No  one  will  live  according  to  her  own  will, but  according  to                obedience. Daughters in Jesus Christ, I recommend growth in                the  spiritual  life  and  union  with  Jesus  by  humiliating                yourselves, obeying, and working for his sake. Love our most                holy mother Mary to the utmost, and appeal to the angels and                the saints with faith and love (D.S.S.).                      I  bless  these  dear  daughters  each  by  each,  recom-                mending perfect observance to the rule, lave for Jesus and                Mary, mutual charity and religious virtues on the whale. May                they  be  simple  and  sincere,  avoiding  any  lie,  which  is  the                souls' ruin. Let them involve themselves in winning souls to                Jesus through meekness, great zeal,","and  sacrifice,  being  aware  that  they  are  victims  far  Jesus                (D.S.S.).                      The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  novices  will  diligently                adorn their soul with holy virtues.                      Considering  how  precious  the  virtues  are,  they  will                meditate  on  the  examples  that  our  Lord,  his  most  holy                mother, and the saints have given us. They will long far and                struggle  hard  to  become  humble,  for  holy  humility  is  the                foundation of the virtues, and to achieve perfect obedience,                the  short  and  sure  way  to  holiness,  and  meekness,  which                edifies and sanctifies.                      They will be patient, silent, recollected, modest, fond of                prayer and spiritual reading, finding their spiritual nourishment                in  confident,  humble  prayer.  Disposed  to  accepting                correction,  they  will  be  able  to  accuse  and  despise                themselves,  and  to  long  for  the  last  place  and  things  as                humble  servants  of  the  community.  Always  aware  of  God's                presence,  they  will  do  everything  with  the  pure  intention  of   56                seeking God and Jesus alone, and of pleasing Jesus and his                mother. They will be active, vigilant, diligent, and industrious.                      While  performing  their  religious  duties,  the  novices  will                be recollected in the presence of God (From the beginning of                the Rules for the novices of Oria).                      Religious  virtues  and the practice  of  divine  love  will  be                the  rules  for  the  novices.  To  grow  in  the  love  of  Jesus,                supreme goodness, they will do and suffer everything for his                sake. They will think of him, meditate on his life, his Passion,                his  death,  and  on  the  mysteries  of  his  infinite  love.  Always                keeping in mind the adorable, divine Savior they will meditate                especially  on  the  pain  of  his  divine  Heart.  They  must  be                loving souls. If they are, love will make them strong in their                suffering, in their work, and in their immolation, leading them                to the divine union,","which is the aim of their suffering and work. (1)  They must                always ask the most holy Heart of Jesus for his love, the love                of the most holy Virgin, and other holy loves. The perfection                of law is love. Happy is the silent, humble, meek, industrious,                and diligent novice who burns with love for Jesus and sighs                with love for him. Out of love for Jesus, and to grow in it, she                humiliates herself, she obeys, she suffers, she does penance,                she prays, and she works. She is aware of the least defect, is                devoted to the perfect observance of the rules, as well as to                the  practice  of  the  holy  virtues.  The  celestial  groom  invites                her  saying,  «  Come  my  beloved,  my  dove,  you  shall  be                crowned » (R.N.).                      Spiritual  life  includes  works  that  are  invisible  to  the                human sight, but they are the secret of the priestly, episcopal,                and  apostolical  action;  they  are  the  efficient  cause  oaf  the                most  charitable  institutions,  the  fire,  which  produces  the                energy,  and  the  driving  power  which  moves  all  things.  Ah!                Without  the  interior  fire,  which  we  call  spiritual  life,  neither                prayer  nor  penance,  nor  any  relationship  between  creature                and Creator, nor a loving union of the soul with God may be   57                achieved.  No  redeeming  ward  can  be  said  to  conquer  the                hearts,  no  truly  useful,  lasting  beneficence  can  be                accomplished. Without this fire, any struggle can be summed                in  this  statement  of  the  apostle:  «  I  have  become  like  one                beating  the  air,  like  an  instrument,  whose  sound  makes  a                vanishing noise » (Speech, April 17, 1915).                      What  does  it  mean  to  be  holy?  God  wants  it,  and  the                apostle put it in these terms: « This is God's will for you: he                wants you to be holy » (1 Thes. 4, 3).                      In  the  shallow  view  of  some  people,  true  holiness  is                always surrounded by severe penances, great manifestation                of transcendental happenings, and first rate miracles,","but they are mistaken, True holiness is perfect union of our                will  with  God's  will  out  of  love  and  with  pure  intention  of                pleasing Him. When a person reaches this happiest state, he                longs  only  to  remain  hidden  in  God,  and  sometimes  he                reaches this goal without being aware of it.                      To work miracles by halting natural laws is unnecessary                for this person, because he has worked the greatest miracle                by giving himself up to God. People can say that his glory is                from  inside  (Ps.  44,  13),  and  he  can  answer:  «  My  life  is                hidden with Christ in God » (Col. 3, 3).                      Jesus  has  said,  «  every  tree  is  known  by  the  fruit  it                bears,  and  a  healthy  tree  bears  good  fruit. »  It  follows  that                simple  and  hidden  as  a  person's  holiness  may  be,  it  is                unavoidable that its clearest signs are perceived by people in                the long run, and in same circumstances. Recollection, mind                always fixed an God, human will always standing fast in the                divine  will,  purest  intention,  chastity,  and  hidden  holiness                cannot help transpiring outside. The people perceive it in his                modest look, in his gentle words and actions, in his upright,   58                wise, prudent talking, in his constant patience and uniformity                in  the  midst  of  the  human  events.  The  people  perceive  it                always mare in his loving, sincere, effusive charity, especially                in his charity toward the offenders. If this person lives under a                rule,  the  hidden  treasure  transpires  through  his  perfect,                scrupulous observance and in the prompt, faithful obedience                to the superiors. Despite whatever effort, the burning fire of                divine love cannot be hidden.                      Elect  and  lucky  people of  any  state and  condition  who                are  holding the fire of  divine  love  in  your  heart,  the  Church                says of you: « May your charity burn with fire and your ardor                kindle your neighbor » (Speech, Nov. 5, 1907).","2. HUMILITY                      Indispensable means to obtain divine grace and eternal                salvation is the virtue or disposition we call humility.                      A definition of this great virtue is as clear as it is simple:                humility  is  quite  the  reverse  of  pride.  Since no  one  likes  to                appear  haughty,  everyone  blames  pride.  Pride  inflates  the                person's heart; it makes us believe that we are so great and                so endowed with understanding, and with so many moral and                natural  gifts,  that  we  can  do  without  teachers,  and  even                without God! On the contrary, humility makes us believe that                God is the supreme being to wham we must be subject, that                our natural, moral, and intellectual gifts depend an God, who                can, deprive us of them. The Apostle St. Paul wrote: « Didn't                God give you everything you have? Well, then, how can you                brag, as if what you have were not a gift? » (1. Cor. 4, 7).                      Humility  makes  us  depend  on  God,  his  holy  laws,  and                somehow  on  those  who  represent  Jesus  Christ  in  civil  and                ecclesiastical societies.                                 59                      Jesus  taught  us  this  great  virtue  with  words  and                examples. In spite of being and remaining God, he became a                man  submitting  himself  to  Mary  and  Joseph,  who  were  his                creatures: « He was obedient to them, » says the evangelist.                Later, he let his enemies take him to the tribunals, suffering                affronts, derision, slaps, and even the infamous death on the                cross  in  the  middle  of  two  thieves.  He  had  said  to  his                disciples: « Learn from me, because I am gentle and humble                in spirit » (Mt. 11, 29).                      Divine  grace,  which  is  granted  through  humility,  is                indispensable to reach eternal salvation.                      If our divine Savior degraded and humiliated himself far                our sake up to the death on the cross in order to sweep away                the pride that Lucifer introduced in human","hearts,  and  to  convince  us  to  be  humble,  how  can  he                introduce in his kingdom those who do not want to be subject                to his law, and to his divine will?                      What are we, compared with the Creator of heaven and                earth, but an imperceptible atom? What madness it is to set                ourselves up above God!                      My Lord, we humiliate ourselves before you with loving                humility.  I  said  with  loving  humility,  because  love  often  has                the power to subdue the lover to the beloved with free, joyous                humility,  as  we  experience  in  the  world.  I  said  with  loving                humility,  because  Jesus  Christ  is  our  father and  we  are  his                children;  he  is  so  loving,  indulgent,  and  benign  with  those                who love him and are subjected to him as children are to their                father!                      Thinking  of  the  times  we  have  sinned  against  God                through  words  and  actions  is  a  great  motive  for  humiliating                ourselves  before  Him.  Haw  many  times  we  forgot,  ignored,                and neglected God despite the fact that he endows our soul   60                and our body with so many gifts, and loves us immensely!                      If we happen to offend a person who loves and helps us,                we feel we have to apologize and beg pardon.                      As for me, my Lord and friend, whom I love so much, I                glory in being lovingly subject to my Lord Jesus Christ, to his                law,  and,  relatively,  to  the  ecclesiastical  or  lay  people  who                have power over me. I think of myself as of a sinner needing                and begging divine forgiveness from the lowing God; kneeling                at his feet I think of being nothing and in need of divine help,                which I implore with clasped hands. I feel myself truly longing                for eternal salvation, which I beg from my Lord Jesus Christ                for  myself,  for  you,  and  far  all  people  with  the  most  ardent                sighs of my heart.                      My  lord  and  brother  in  Jesus  Christ,  do  not  dislike                kneeling before the loving, sweet Jesus, who is our brother","in  human  nature,  but  eternal,  infinite,  omnipotent  God  in                divinity.                      You  may  consider  haw  many  personalities  and  haw                many highnesses did not dislike bending toward the dishonor                of  Golgotha,  who  practiced  the  religious  devotions  that  so                many people flee from as though they were suitable only to                simple women and weak souls (Letter to the Friends)!                      The preciousness of this virtue was unknown before our                Lord Jesus Christ's coming. But when God-man washed the                apostles'  feet  and  died  with  shame  as  a  criminal  on  the                infamous cross in the middle of two thieves, humility became                a precious virtue.                      Some  people  think  of  humility  as  dejection,  while  it  is                quite the reverse: humility makes us grow and lifts us up to                Gad.  Besides  being  the  death  of  pride,  ambition,  and                arrogance, the passions that vilify the person, humility makes                us kind, prudent, and agreeable. While arrogance makes us                odious, humility wins everyone's esteem for us by making us   61                restrain from boasting and despising, because it is mother of                modesty and prudence.                      Since  «  God  resists  the  proud,  but  gives  grace  to  the                humble » (1 Pt. 5, 5), it is impossible to obtain graces from                Gad without humility (Letter to the friends).                      Even  though  we  do  not  take  a  vow  of  humility,  -  it  is                included in obedience and poverty and it is the foundation of                the  religious  virtues  -  even  so,  we  Rogationists  have  to                cultivate it in a special way. We must endeavor to be interiorly                humble by acknowledging our nothingness and by attributing                everything  we  do  to  God.  Because  our  failures  waste                everything,  we  are  always debtors  to  God  for  any good  we                accomplish,  and  we  must  show  our  gratitude  to  Him  in                humble words and behavior. Each one will love the last place,                the humblest things, and the","vilest jobs according to the teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.                When  someone  is  reproached  or  admonished,  he  will  not                excuse himself but will humbly accept everything and amend;                if  necessary,  he  may  explain  his  motives  once.  Each                fellow-member  will  meditate,  or  at  least  be  aware  of  the                shame  and  infamy  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  endured  in  his                Passion for our sins and will accustom himself to love infamy                and contempt as the greatest spiritual goods. Submission of                one's  own  will  to  the  superior,  and  detachment  from  one's                own opinion belong to the virtue of holy humility (C.R.).                      Humility contest. (2)  Even though this sublime contest is                concerned  with  exterior  behavior,  still  it  fosters  the                community's edification and one's own sanctification.                      To  foster  good  external  behavior,  the  people  must                combine  it  with  the  internal  attitude  of  humility,  mortifying                themselves  interiorly,  acknowledging  their  weakness,  and                punishing their selfishness with acts of external humility with                our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  divine  humility,  practicing  them  in                perfect  union  with  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  and  trying  to   62                imitate  the  great  mother  of  God's  attitude,  she  who  is  the                humblest  among  the  creatures.  Till  the  end  of  the  contest,                every day they will ask the adorable heart of Jesus, the mast                holy  Virgin  Mary,  the  angels  and  the  saints  for  a  particular                grace  so  that  they  may  properly  train  themselves  in  this                sublime virtue, which pleases the Hearts of Jesus and Mary                as much as it disheartens and puts down the devil.                      During  the  time  contest,  the  people  will  direct  the                religious  practices,  the actions  in  common,  the  exercises  of                piety  and  charity  to  the  holy  aim  of  improving  themselves                through  humility  in  order  to  please  the  mast  holy  Hearts  of                Jesus and Mary as much as they can.                          The sisters must be told that the aim of the contest","is to be humiliated, not glorified before others; therefore, the                slaves of the queen of heaven and earth will make use of the                holy  industries  to  humiliate  themselves,  and  to  remain  the                humblest among all.                      Advises:                      1.  During  the  time  of  the  virtue  contest,  the  spiritual                reading  in  common  or  in  private  will  be  appropriate  to  the                specific virtue of the contest.                      2. The contest is not under pain of sin, and the winner is                the person who accomplishes everything with mare virtue, not                the one who does more.                                   3. THE SPIRIT OF THE INSTITUTE                      The  spirit  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation's  institute  is  the                spirit oaf charity, zeal, and sacrifice as our Lard Jesus Christ                manifested it in his earthly life and, as the holy gospels report.   63                Charity,  zeal,  and  sacrifice,  however,  must  be  founded  on                humility and meekness of the most holy Heart of Jesus, who                invites us to imitate these virtues.                      We  have  to  make  continuous  efforts  to  love  God,  our                Lord  and  Creator,  with  a  predominant,  strong,  tender,                constant,  fervent,  active,  compassionate,  effective,  and                uniting love. Love of Jesus must be the beginning, the object,                the  end,  and  the  mover  of  our  intentions,  actions,  and                observance:  Jesus,  everything  in  Jesus,  through  Jesus,  for                Jesus, and from Jesus. Through Jesus and his divine love we                have  to  nurture  the  holy  affections  in  our  heart,  along  with                love  for  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  who  is  the  creature                predestined  from  among  all  the  others,  the  mother  of  God                and  ours,  the  mystical  city  of  God,  the  masterpiece  of  his                omnipotence; also the Patriarch","St. Joseph, who is Immaculate Mary's Virgin spouse and the                Son  of  God's putative  father; as  well  as  the  dearest  angels                and the saints, whose happy company we hope to enjoy for                ever.                      At last, in Jesus along with his pure love, we have to love                our  neighbor  as  ourselves  with  passionate,  brotherly                affection, because our neighbor is image of God, our fellow,                and  touch  stone  of  our  love  far  Jesus;  love  for  God  and                neighbor  became  one  precept  including  the  law  and  the                prophets as well. This precept sums up the Old and the New                Testament, the holy Church's laws, the Fathers, Doctors, and                ecclesiastical  writers'  works  as  well  as  the  word  that  the                apostles,  the  martyrs,  and  the  confessors  preached  in  all                times; in short, everything depends on love of God and love                of  neighbor  as  of  ourselves':  this  is  charity,  charity  is  God,                and God is charity (Points of Rules).                                    4. LET US LOVE GOD                                                                          64                     God  is  infinite  goodness,  and  we  must  love  Him.  He                holds  all  perfections,  beauties,  treasures,  which  we  are                unable to understand. If we look at nature, we see a faintest                image of the divine properties. Let us look at space: it is so                immense that the human mind cannot compute it; still, God is                more.  Look  at  the  stars:  they  are  millions  and  millions  and                many  of  them  are  greater  than  earth  a  hundred  thousand                times;  suspended  in  the  empty  space,  they  orbit  with                admirable order, stiII they cannot express how powerful God                is, because he created there with a word and He is able to                create  as  many  of  them  as  he  wants.  Look  at  nature:  how                many beauties it has! Beautiful is spring, fragrant the flowers,                majestic the mountains, pretty the creeks, pleasant the fields,                mysterious the graves, terrible the oceans: how much beauty                and variety the author of them holds!","The virtues of the saints come from God, who is infinite                goodness.  He  shows  Himself  to  the  blessed  ones  who  see                Him face to face, experiencing a loving happiness that differs                from one another. Without lessening Himself, He rewards the                merits of the elect by making them contemplate Himself for                ever as eternally new, despite His being all the same. They                love Him because He is worthy of being loved, not because                they  take  pleasure  in  loving  the  infinite  goodness.  Even                though  He  would  make  them  suffer  eternally,  they  would                continue loving Him.                      Now,  then,  if  God  is  infinite  goodness  holding  the                wholeness of beauty and greatness, does He not deserve our                love (Speech on the love of God, June 21, 1877)?                      When  we  consider  that  God  loved  us  with  eternal                charity, our mind is moved, our heart is touched. We were not                yet  born  nor  our  parents  nor  our  forefathers,  and  God  was                loving us. Neither earth nor the sky nor the stars existed, and                God was loving us.                                                                          65                     Do  you  think  God  was  in  need  of  us,  poor  creatures?                wasn't  He  fully  happy  without  us?  Being  all  the  same  fully                happy, God did not need us, nor was He obliged to love or                create us; and yet, He loved our souls so much that He not                only created, but also redeemed us. He made us in His image                and when we lost His image because of sin, He sent His only                son on earth to redeem us. What does this most benign Lord                demand oaf us for his love? Nothing else but love!                      Which  merciless  heart  will  deny  love  to  God?  Poor                creatures!  They  love  everything  but  God!  And  yet,  earthly                loves are vain, are nothing. Look at the, world and show me                what God's creature love. Some love money, others clothing;                some  food, others  property  and  wealth;  some  conversation,                others glory and honor; some love creatures;","and with what profane love, transport, and passion they love                them! Ah! The main loves blinding human beings are loves of                self-interest  and  of  creatures.  How.  do  they  sacrifice                themselves  for  the  sake  of  self-interest  and  of  creatures!                They  spend  nights,  face  risks,  struggle  for  a  living,  swear,                work,  and  endanger  their  life!  They  declare to  live  for  each                other, to share the days, the pains, the sufferings of their life!                People go so far as to idolize creatures!                      But happy is the person who is penetrated by the sparkle                of divine love; happy is the person that out of love lives with                great  transport,  loving  the  Creator  in  creatures:  instead  of                loving self-interest, he loves the king of all treasures, instead                of  loving  vanity,  he  loves  the  eternal  truth!  Happy  is  the                person who says to the world: « Treacherous world, you do                not  suit  me!  You  have  nothing  else  but  tribulation  and                bitterness;  I  have  drunk  from  your  cup  experiencing  hove                bitter it is; I do not love you, I do not surrender my heart to                you;  on  the  contrary,  I  love  Jesus,  I  want  to  surrender  my                heart to Jesus » (Speech on God's love for us).                                                                          66                     God! The eternal, infinite being that gave existence to all                things; the pure holiness, pure goodness, pure beauty holding                all things without being held, seeing and knowing everything                without  being  totally  known;  the  light,  life,  splendor,  glory,                truth, and eternal love! If a son must lave his father because                he is the begetter, with greater reason the people must love                God,  who  created  them  from  nothing  and  redeemed  them                from eternal death. Far this reason God said: « You must love                the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with                all  your  strength,  and  with  all  your  mind  »  (Lk.  10,  27).                (Speech, June 13, 1898) .","5. LOVE FOR JESUS                      Dearest  children,  I  exhort  you  to  expand  your  heart  in                the  most  holy  love  of  the  adorable,  most  loving  Jesus  our                Lord. Oh! What results may youths achieve, if they do not feel                love for Jesus (Letter, Feb. 13, 1922)?                      Jesus  dislikes  cold  hearts,  but  likes  intimate,  tender,                effusive, strong, calm, constant love. Please love Jesus with                great  transport  of  will  and mind,  with  all  the  interior  powers                and  the  feelings  of  your  soul;  be  always  fully  aware  of  his                adorable  person  and  of  the  mysteries  of  his  most  holy  life.                May the holy tabernacle, which is the loving nest where his                divine body gathers the eagles, attract you (Speech, 1906).                      If you can do a favor to Jesus, the best you can do is to                say « I love you. » He longs for and wants love from us. Let                us  say  it,  therefore,  over  and  over  again;  when  unable  to                speak, we will say it by heart! So that no moment of our life                be  without  pronouncing  such  a  saying,  we  declare  that  we                intend to repeat « Jesus, I love you! »  at each beat of our   67                heart.  Jesus  deserves  our  love;  why  shouldn't  we  heartly                reciprocate his infinite love by loving him with our little love?                We say, therefore, aver and over again with all our heart: «                Jesus, I love you. » (3)                      Daughters  in  Jesus  Christ,  let  us  endeavor  to  sanctify                ourselves, because all else is vanity. The Holy Spirit said: «                Where there is no science of the soul, there is no good. » Let                us love Jesus, our supreme goodness, attend to him with one                heart,  one  soul,  one  mind;  let  us  look  at  Jesus,  work  far                Jesus,  zeal  far  the  interests  of  his  heart,  worry  for  what                worries him, and rejoice far what pleases him. Let us have no                thought but Jesus, because we find happiness in Jesus only.","It  is  true  that  we  face  0pposition,  contradiction,                straightness, and troubles, but all these things are means of                sanctification. Daughters, be sure of this: if you were in the                world, you would be suffering tribulation and labor much more                serious and bitter than the ones you endure in the religious                life,  but  without  merit.  Therefore,  let  us  be  pleased  with                suffering  some  pain  together  with  Jesus,  our  supreme                goodness, who suffered so much for our sake! Besides, he                knows how to reward even in this life those who suffer for him                (Letter, May 13, 1889).                      Today is the feast of the most holy Heart of Jesus; I do                not  know  whether  you  applied  and  concentrated  your                thoughts on the importance of Jesus and his divine heart for a                while.                      If this precious sparkle of love for Jesus does not get a                light in our hearts, everything is useless. The apostle said: « I                may  have  all  the  faith  needed  to  move  mountains...  I  may                give away everything I have, and even give up my body to be                burned, but if I have not love, it does me no good » (1 Cor.   68                13, 2-3).                      We must consider what Jesus is, his love for the people,                and  the  happiness  in  loving  him.  But,  pay  attention!  Loving                Jesus does not mean to feel some sensible devotion or the                pleasure of doing nothing else but staying in the Church; on                the contrary, it means mortification, submission to obedience,                avoiding sins, even the least ones, carrying the cross of labor,                privation,  contradiction,  and  suffering.  Divine  love,  which                brings consolation, is kindled in the soul this way.                      You  see  how  very  important  your  cultivation  of  daily                virtues  is.  The  people  striving  for  perfection  are  greatly                rewarded even in this life because Jesus likes taking humble,                pure,  fervent  souls  as  his  brides.  The  tepid,  negligent,                stubborn souls are unsuitable.","The people willing to belong totally to the Lord will help                themselves  by  prayer  and  by  appealing  to  the  most  holy                Virgin, because without her protection we achieve no good.                Since  the  foundation  of  religious  life  is  the  most  perfect                subjection,  respect,  and  confidence  toward  superiors,  I                recommend these virtues to you.                      I bless you all; I intend to give a particular blessing from                the Heart of Jesus to the one who, after reading this letter,                will make the best resolves, putting them into practice (Letter,                June 19, 1903).                              6. THE MOST PRECIOUS BLOOD                      By  the  Lord's  grace,  in  our  institutes  we  have  always                been devout to the most holy Heart of Jesus, to his most Holy                Name, and to his most Holy Face.                      For a long time I have been having a mind to combine                the  three  devotions,  which  are  related  to  our  Lord  Jesus   69                Christ, with the great devotion to the most Precious Blood, in                whose honor we say this beautiful ejaculatory prayer: « We                salute Man-God's immaculate blood, precious money for the                sinners' ransom. »                      On  purpose  I  sent  this  booklet  of  the  Most  Precious                Blood to this house; please take note in the calendar so that                this devotion may be practiced in July, every year. (4)                      In these gloomy times we can present our regards and                homages of atonement to the most Precious Blood that the                divine  Savior  of  our  souls  shed  for  sinners  with  such  great                suffering; we can also present this great price of our ransom                to  the  eternal  divine  Father  for  the  salvation  of  the  holy                Church and of the world through plenty of holy workers (Circ.,                July 24, 1919).","7. THE MOST HOLY NAME OF JESUS                                                              Feb. 22, 1921                      Since  Jan.  1888,  about  34  years  ago,  we  have  been                attributing  a  great  importance  to  the  petition  we  present  on                Jan. 31, a day consecrated to the feast of Jesus' holy name                in our houses; this importance should never decrease.                      Such an importance is based on our Lord Jesus Christ's                divine promises, who said to his disciples, the apostles, and                all the Christians till the end of the world: « I tell you the truth:                the Father will give you whatever you ask of Him in my name                » (Jn. 16, 23). On another occasion he said: « And I will do                whatever  you  ask  for  in  my  name  »  (Jn.  14,  13).  He  also                added:  «  Till  now  you  have  not  asked  for  anything  in  my                name; ask and you will receive, so that your happiness may                be complete » (Jn. 16, 24).                                                                          70                     Not  believing  these  divine  promises  is  not  believing  in                Jesus Christ's divinity. Asking in the name of our Lord means                asking through his divine merits, which can obtain everything                from the eternal Father. By praying in the name of Jesus we                join his earthly, perfect prayers which the eternal Father could                not help granting; now, Jesus repeats his divine petition from                the tabernacle, and we join them every time we pray in his                name,  firmly  trusting  that  God  will  deny  nothing  owing  to                Jesus' promise. If we have to pray so in any time, with greater                reason we have to do so an the day dedicated to his mast                Holy Name.                      The feast in honor of the Holy Name falls twice: on New                Year's Day, Circumcision of the Lard, when he was given the                sweetest name Jesus, and in the first days","of January when the liturgy specifically celebrates the Name                of Jesus. Owing to this, January is usually dedicated to the                most holy name, which is above all names, in which we find                safety, before which heaven, earth, and hell kneel.                      This  beautiful,  beneficial  devotion  is  among  the  main                ones in our institute. During the mass we read from a booklet                on  the  most  holy  name  of  Jesus,  say  its  litany,  and  sing  a                song  of  the  most  holy  name  after  the  benediction.  The                solemn  novena  to  the  holy  name  begins on  Jan.  22  before                the Blessed Sacrament solemnly exposed, and the novena is                preached wherever it is possible.                      We celebrate the feast on Jan. 31 saying two masses of                the most holy name, one low, the other high by permission of                the  Holy  See.  A  most  special  petition  is  presented  to  the                eternal Father on that day following the custom we began 34                years ago. The petition along with 34 requests concerning the                best  spiritual  goods  is  conveniently  prepared  in  January;                through  this  petition  we  implore  from  the  eternal  Father                spiritual  good for  ourselves  and  our houses  in  the  name of   71                Jesus; we also implore the temporal goods that are related to                the sanctification and improvement of our communities.                      The  petitions  we  have  already  made,  especially  the                printed  ones,  show  how  the  new  petitions  are  going  to  be                formed. To comply with the precept of the Apostle Paul: « In                all  prayers  ask  God  for  what  you  need,  always  asking  him                with  a  thankful  heart  »  (Ph.  4,  6),  each  request  will  be                preceded  by  a  tender  thanksgiving  for  the  graces  we  have                already obtained. Every year we add or take away something                from the previous petitions, according to the circumstances;                by so doing we diversify them; sometimes, however, we had                no need to make changes.","The Daughters of Divine Zeal must know that this great                devotion to the most holy, adorable name of Jesus must be in                force and fervor in our institute forever, dedicating January to                his  name,  celebrating  the  feast  on  Jan.  31,  and  presenting                the  petition  along  with  the  34  requests  to  the  Father  in  the                name of Jesus.                            8. HOW TO PRESENT THE PETITION                      The  private  petition  we  present  in  our  semi-public                oratories  or  in  our  houses  or  in  our  churches  may  use                different para-liturgies.                      In  the  oratories,  after  the  mass  we  expose  the  Holy                Sacrament for the adoration we do until midday. At noon, the                communities gather in the oratory at the foot of Jesus, and a                priest of ours reads the petition. AM follow the reading with                their  mind  and  heart,  saying  with  contrition «  Gloria  Patri  »                after each request. At the end, the priest places the petition                behind  the  altar-card  and  ends  the  para-liturgy  with  the   72                blessing of the Holy Sacrament. « Te Deum » may precede                the benediction..                      In  default  of  our  priests,  we  invite  another  one  for  the                benediction. Should be this the case, the mother superior or                an older sister will read the petition.                      Presenting the petition to the eternal divine Father in the                most holy name of Jesus contemporaneously in our houses is                beautiful,  pleasant,  and  of  greater  effectiveness.  If  the                community  has  only  a  public  church,  the  petition  will  follow                this pattern:                      Before noon the community gathers in the closed church                to present the petition. If a priest happens to be available he                will open the tabernacle shortly before the reading. If no priest                is available, the tabernacle will remain closed, but the lights                will be on.","If the church is open to the faithful, the priest will prepare                the people in order to present a public petition, which may be                one of those we have published in the booklets of the most                Holy Name of Jesus, but he may adapt it to circumstances of                time and place (S.D.D.Z.).                      The following day we begin offering 34 masses to have                the requests granted; the offering of these masses is private                (Circ. Jan. 25, 1920).                                  9. MARY! THE MOTHER!                      Here is the stormy sea's mystic star of our life: Mary!                      The  infinite  wisdom  of  God  met  the  inner  needs  of                human nature by giving us the most holy Mary as mother!                      The name mother is sweet, dear to the sensitive heart.                Everyone feels a tender affection for his mother, because she                conceived him, carried him, begot him in labor pains, hugged   73                him  in  her  motherly  arms,  warmed  him  with  kisses,  raised                him,  and  raised  him  with  the  irresistible,  effusive  love  of                motherhood.                      Besides giving us such a natural mother, God also gave                us  a  more  tender,  laving  mother  in  the  supernatural  order.                This mother is the ideal of any beauty, grace, holiness, and                love!  By  gathering  in  her  the  highest  degree  of  beauty  and                goodness, God made her creation's masterpiece.                      The  Evangelist  St.  Luke  (1.  46-55)  reports  the  Magni-                ficat, the inspired hymn Mary spoke extempore to exalt God                for the gifts and privileges He had endowed her with: « My                heart is glad because of God... because of the great things                the Mighty has done for me. »                      The  most  holy  Mary's  highest  claim  of  glory  and                greatness resides in the divine Word's incarnation in her","purest  womb  by the  work of  the  Holy  Spirit.  She  conceived                Jesus  Christ,  God  and  man,  in  her  immaculate  womb,  and                begot  the  divine  child  in  a  grotto  at  Bethlehem  without                lessening her virginity, but remaining always a Virgin. A virgin                mother!  Virginity  and  maternity  combined  together!  What  a                supernatural beauty!                      Virgin-Mother of God! Such a maternity's sublime glory                exalts  Mary  above  the  angels,  giving her a throne  near  the                most holy Trinity. Furthermore, by becoming mother of Jesus                Christ Mary also became our mother, mother of humankind.                      Please  check  the  holy  gospel.  Because  of  his  human                nature  descending  from  Adam,  Jesus  Christ  called  himself                our brother; we are, therefore, children of the most holy Mary                through  Jesus.  The  evangelist  John  reports  the  touching                event of Jesus that, being at the point of death and making                signs with his head to his mother in sorrow at the foot of the                cross, pointed to John and said, « Woman, here is your son »                (Jn.  19,  2G).  The  sacred  writers  explain  that  our  Lord                bequeathed humankind and all the people as children to the   74                most holy Mary in the disciple John.                      What  an  inexpressible  testament  of  love!  Showing  the                mother Jesus also said to John, « Here is your mother » (Jn.                19, 26). What a loving, lucky filiation is this one! While Mary is                bound  to  take  care  of  us  as  her  children,  we  are  bound  to                love and respect her  as our mother! We are unable to fully                understand how much the most holy Mary loves each of us.                Standing before God she prays and obtains so many graces                for us!                      My  dearest  lord,  if  you  happened  to  be  saved  from  a                danger or if you recovered from illness or  succeeded in any                enterprise  or  received  benefits,  all  this  depended  on  our                celestial mother's love, even though you did not","appeal to her! Probably you happened to suffer because of                God's plan. That suffering made you wish to lead a better life,                owing to human events; however it may be, suffering cannot                be avoided on earth; and yet, the cure of illness as well as                patience  and  submission  to  suffering,  are  due  to  the  mast                holy Mary's intercession (Letter to the Friends).                      My  dearest  lord,  do  you  want any  flavor  from  heaven?                Do you want to be sure of your eternal salvation? Love and                entreat the most holy Mary. She is the Star of the Sea of our                life. The Church greets her « Star of the Sea. » She is the                rising dawn, the Morning Star, the Ark of salvation!                      The Church's Fathers and Doctors affirm that devotion to                the mast holy Mary or even a sparkle of love toward this great                mother  or  a  tender  look  far  her  sorrows  at  the  foot  of  the                cross is a sign of predestination.                      My lord, do you know what Mary begins to do when you                endeavor to lave her, to invoke her, and to pray to her? She                draws  you  up  to  God,  letting  lave  for  Jesus  spring  in  your   75                heart for your salvation; she enlightens your mind about the                mysteries of faith, infuses humility and docility, lets you know                and  long  far  divine  grace  and  far  God's  friendship.  There                arises  in  you  a  sweet  impulse  to  practice  our  holy  Catholic                religion;  in  short,  she  gently  leads  you  to  eternal  salvation                (Ibidem).                      It is a general opinion of the sacred writers, the Fathers,                the Doctors of the Church, and of Catholic doctrine that love                and  devotion  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  is  a  great  sign  of                predestination to eternal life.                      The reason is that the most holy Virgin has been elected                by God to be our mother and mediatrix before His throne. Oh!                If  we  fully  understood  the  most  holy  Virgin's  motherly  love                toward each soul; how she longs","for  the  salvation  of  all;  haw  she  prays  before  God  for  the                eternal salvation of each of us!                      Her  motherly  love  notwithstanding,  our  cooperation  is                necessary for we have to believe, love, hope, avoid sin, and                observe  divine  law.  My  dearest  lord,  I  exhort  you  to  love                intensely  this  great,  purest,  beautiful,  immaculate  mother.                She is the reflection of God's splendor, the purest mirror of                divine  perfections,  the  powerful  mediatrix,  the  benign,                merciful  lady,  the  queen  of  heaven  and  earth.  God extolled                her above the saints and the angels in the celestial glory for                she  is  related  to  the  most  holy  Trinity,  is  the  first-born                daughter of God the Father, the always virgin mother of God                the Son, the immaculate bride of God the Holy Spirit.                      Please  put  your  eternal  salvation  in  the  hands  of  this                great mother (Ibidem).                              10. ALL GRACES THROUGH MARY                    76                      « Out of the fullness of his grace he has blessed us all »                (Jn. 1, 16). When St. Bernard the doctor ascribed this saying                to  the  most  holy  Mary  he  did  not  limit  her  beneficent,                universal  action  to  the  sphere  of  our  earthly  life.  The  most                holy  Mary's  beneficent  action  transcends  the  boundaries  of                this  world,  reaching  the  happy  souls  of  heaven  as  well  as                those  who  are  in  purgatory,  making  the  triumphant,  the                militant, and the purifying Church enjoy streams of her grace                and glory: « of her fullness we all have received » (Jn. 1, 16).                      Besides  perceiving  that  their  salvation  depended  an                Mary,  the  blessed  of  heaven  feel  themselves  overpaid                because  they  see  and  share  in  the  celestial  beauties,  the                sublime dignity, the virtues, and the incomparable glory of the                great Queen of Angels and Saints. Their predestination","to glory is bound to the eternal predestination of God's first-                born daughter; they, therefore, enjoy God through Mary. As to                the militant Church, who can explain how all the people have                received  and  are  receiving  from  her  fullness?  Always  and                everywhere the most holy Mary's beneficent, celestial action                represents  the  continuous,  unfolding  fecundity  coming  from                Jesus' merits. From aver 20 centuries the most holy Mary's                beneficent action wonderfully displays her favor an the souls                in  purgatory:  she  enters  into  the  dark  prison  and  the                tremendous  fire  to  relieve  and  set  free  those  afflicted                prisoners. The sacred writers, many Fathers and Doctors of                the  Church  as  well  as  many  revelations  to  the  saints  show                identical opinions on this matter (Speech, Dec. 1, 1918).                              11. THE SACRED HEART OF MARY                      I  would  like  to  submit  two  reasons  that  show  why  the                Heart of Mary is the most perfect.                                                                          77                     1. The Heart of Mary is immaculate.                      Adam's  corrupt  blood  carrying  the  germs  of  the  pas-                sions,  as  well  as  any  passion  coming  from  Adam's  blood                never  took  effect  in  the  purest  Heart  of  Mary:  no  feeling  of                anger,  no  throb  of  grudge,  no  move  of  wrath,  no  envy,  not                any passion ever defiled the finest delicate fiber of that Heart                that  came  out  of  God's  hands  so  pure  and beautiful.  Since                the  Word's  most  hilly  human  body  was  going  to  be  farmed                through Mary's blood, only immaculate blood ran through her                Heart. Likewise since the Heart of Mary was immaculate, free                from  any  breath  of  passion,  pure,  candid,  innocent,  it  was                also tender, noble, sensitive, and generous beyond all hearts.","2.  The  Heart of  Mary  was  full  of  all  graces and  burning                with the flames of divine lave.                      Human mind can hardly reach the full understanding of                the  abundance  of  grace  that  God  put  in  the  Heart  of  Mary                when He created it: how many lovely touches, gentle charms                God  exerted  on  that  Heart,  how  many  tender  plays,  how                many  games  God  worked  in  the  Heart  of  Mary.  It  is  not                possible to fully understand the flames of divine love burning                in her sacred heart, nor can we comprehend the meaning of                that  burning,  at  whose  comparison  the  angels'  love  is  a                sparkle.  It  is  well  known  that  when  grace  makes  nature                perfect,  it  regenerates  it.  Under  the  work  of  grace  the                roughest  souls  and  the  most  indelicate  natures  became                tender and sensitive; once entered into the heart (rough and                insensible as it may be), the fire of divine love purifies from                any  earthly  affection,  elevates,  deifies,  and  transforms  the                heart into a new one. What grace and divine love operated in                the Immaculate Heart of Mary so filled as it was with God's                love? To what degree did they make perfect the nature that                God created perfect and endowed with the finest qualities?   78                      The bride of the Songs says: « My Beloved has spoken                unto me and my soul has melted with love. » The Beloved not                only  made  the  Heart  of  Mary  hear  his  voice,  but  he  also                entered it to gather lilies. « My Beloved, » says Mary, « went                dawn  to  his  garden...  to  gather  lilies  »  (Songs  6,  1-2).  The                garden  of  the  Beloved  is  the  Heart  of  Mary,  where  Jesus                entered for  the  incarnation,  where  he rested  with  his  divine                complacency pasturing spices and lilies, which represent the                virtues, especially holy purity.                      Created pure and immaculate, full of grace, and burning                with  divine  love,  the  Heart  of  Mary  was  chosen  far  the                dwelling of the eternal king; God could not help creating","it  as  the  best,  the  most  sensible,  tender,  generous,  noble,                perfect among all hearts (Speech, without date).                      The novices will foster devotion... toward the most holy                Virgin Mary holding her as their mother; they will honor her                Immaculate Heart along with the Heart of Jesus, and will pray                to her for the conversion of sinners (5) (R.L.P.).                             12. TWO HEARTS FORM ONE HEART                      Yes, two hearts form one heart: the heart of God and the                heart  of  a  creature,  that  is,  the  Heart  of  God-Man  and  the                Heart of Immaculate Mary form one heart. We wonder how                this divine unification appeared in the Son of God's actions on                earth! If the Heart of Jesus pulsated with a perfect adoration                of God from the time that it was formed, it did so not alone,                but together with the Immaculate Heart of Mary. If the most                holy  Heart  of  Jesus  made  a  continuous  offering  of  itself  to                God  during  the  nine  months  he  was  developing  in  Mary's   79                immaculate womb, it did so not alone, but together with the                Immaculate Heart of Mary. The most holy Heart of Jesus did                not wail alone while lying on the straw of Bethlehem’s grotto,                because  the  mystical  dove  Mary  was  wailing  together  with                him  in  her  heart.  Not  only  the  Heart  of  Jesus  attracted  the                simple-minded  shepherds  and  the  three  lucky  kings  of  the                East  to  the  grotto,  but  also  the  Immaculate  Heart  of  Mary                exerted  that  attraction.  When  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  was  in                the  carpenter's  shop  or  praying  in  the  mountains  during his                private life of about 30 years, the Heart of Immaculate Mary                was  spiritually  joined  together  with  the  Heart  of  Jesus,                working, praying, and sighing with him. When the time of his                manifestation in Jerusalem came to pass, the most adorable                Heart of","Jesus  worked  the  wonders  of  his  mercy  teaching  far  three                years;  in  al  these  manifestations  the  Heart  of  Mary  was                associated  to  his  intentions.  We  cannot  imagine  Jesus  and                Mary's way of living as simply natural; when one of them was                far  from  the  other,  both  of  them  were  sharing  their  life  by                communicating their thoughts. A proof  of this strict union of                hearts is found in the miracle at the wedding in Cana; but it is                in the mysteries of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ that                we find the Hearts of Jesus and Mary in perfect union of love                (Speech, July 29, 1890).                                 13. THE MOST HOLY MARY:                           MASTERPIECE OF THE C'REATIO'N                      All creatures somehow carry the image of God Creator,                enjoying the manifestation of his infinite love..., but the most                holy Virgin Mary among all creatures enjoys the divine love                beyond  all  description  because  God  created  her  more                beautiful,  more  lovable,  and  richer  with  gifts  and  privileges   80                than all creatures joined together.                      The  most  holy  Mary's  creation  surpasses  that  of  all                beings  because  when  God  created  the  universe  along  with                the reasonable beings, He was keeping in mind the most holy                Virgin as His masterpiece. For this reason the Church applies                the words of Wisdom to the most holy Mary, in the reading:                        Yahweh created me when his purpose first unfolded,                              before the oldest of his works.                             From everlasting I was firmly set,                      from the beginning, before earth came into being.                            The deep was not, when I was born,                          there were no springs to gush with water.","Before the mountains were settled,                                before the hills, I came to birth;                      before he made the earth, the countryside, or the first                                   grains of the world's dust.                          When ;he fixed the heavens firm, I was there,                         when he drew a ring an the surface of the deep,                              when he thickened the clouds above,                           when he fixed fast the springs of the deep,                            when he assigned the sea its boundaries                            - and the waters will not invade the shore –                         when he laid down the foundations of the earth,                             I was by his side, a master craftsman...                              For the. man who finds .me finds fife,                                 he will win favor from Yahweh.                                     (Prov. 8, 22-30, 35).                     The holy Church puts these scriptural sublime ex-                pressions in the most holy Virgin's mouth, and we draw from                it that she is the masterpiece of creation. When God created                heaven and earth He was keeping in mind the most holy                Mary, who was going to gather in herself the beauties of   81                nature, grace, and glory.                     The beauties of nature are wonderfully contained in                Mary. Beautiful is the sun shooting forward streams of light on                earth; but mare beautiful is Mary dressed with the Sun of                eternal light, as St. John saw her in the Revelation: « a                woman, whose dress was the sun » (Rev. 12, 1). Beautiful is                the moon brightening with silver light in the dark nights; but                the moon is the most holy Mary's footrest, « who had the                moon under her feet » (Ibidem). Beautiful are the stars                twinkling in the immense dome of the firmament; but the stars                are the crown for the virginal head of Mary: and « a crown of                12 stars on her head » (Ibidem). Beautiful are the spring                flowers, more beautifully clothed than Solomon; but the Virgin                Mary is Jericho's mystical","rose  surpassing  all  roses  with  the  gentle  fragrance  of  her                divine virtues. She is the most holy Trinity's mystical white lily                which  appeared  before  the  eyes  of  God  purer  than  the                angels. The beauty we see in the universe is a faint reflection                compared  with  the  beauty,  majesty,  and  decorum  of                Immaculate Mary!                      All .the beauty of nature is contained in Mary, that is the                least of her attributes, for she enshrines the marvels of grace,                surpassing  in  holiness  all  saints  and  angels  together. Many                sacred writers are so assured of this truth that St. Alphonsus                coils it « common and certain knowledge. » For that reason                St. Bonaventure explains the words of Eccl. (24, 16): « I have                taken  root  in  a  privileged  people  »,  this  way:  Mary  has  the                fullness of holiness, the saints partake of.                      Based  on  this  certain  doctrine  St.  AIphonsus  says  that                Mary  was  probably  endowed  with  such  a  holiness  from  the                time  of  her  Immaculate  Conception,  because  she  was                destined  to  be  Mother  of  God;  to  substantiate  this  idea  he                quotes St. Vincent Ferreri: « The Virgin was sanctified in her   82                mother's  womb  beyond  the  saints  and  the  angels.  »  The                prophet David said that the foundation of God's mystical city,                that is Mary, should be laid on the holy mountain top: « His                city  founded  on  the  holy  mountain  »  (Ps.  87,  1).  St.                Alphonsus explains: « The beginning of the most holy Mary's                life should be higher than that of all the saints. » The prophet                Isaiah expressed the same idea when he said that the house                of Gad should be founded on the highest mountain top. St.                Gregory explains: « The summit of the mountains is Mary's                lofty  position,  shining  over  all  the  saints.  »  .  What  next?                Talking  with  Mary  God  said,  «  many  women  have  done                admirable things, but you surpass them all » (Prov. 31, 29).                Please note that all refers to the elects together, not one by                one.","If the most holy Mary has surpassed all creatures in the                gifts of nature and grace, it follows that she surpassed them                all in the glory in such a degree that she is more glorious in                heaven  than  the  angels  and  the  saints  all  together;  I  would                say  that  the  angels  and  saints'  beatitude  does  not  reach  a                millionth of that of the most holy Mary. We state the reason                for that: the most holy Mary's relationship with the most holy                Trinity is so intimate that she shares in the infinite glory. She                is the Father's firstborn daughter, and he gladdens her with                his eternal happiness; the San has her as his most beloved                mother,  and  in  his  infinite  wisdom  he  shares  with  her  the                inconceivable joy that he enjoys in his Father; the Holy Spirit                has taken her as his mast privileged bride, and bestows on                her  the  everlasting  fire  of  sanctifying  love  which  forms  his                beatitude in the procession from the Father and the Son. The                most  hidden,  elating  mysteries  of  highest  glory  are  fully                communicated to the sublime Lady of heaven and earth; to                make a comparison, we state that the angels and the saints                are  like  a  drink  from  a  creek  of  glory,  while  Mary,  eternal                beatitude,  fills  and  gives  joy  to  God's  mystical  city,  like  an                impetuous river: There is a river whose streams refresh the   83                city of God (Ps. 46, 4). (Speech, 1899).                             14. OUR LOVE FOR THE MADONNA                      The  flame  of  love,  forming  the  saints,  is  their  tender,                profound, gentle love for the great Mother of God, the most                holy Mary! Such a love is in full accord with the love of God                who  gives  all  graces  through  Immaculate  Mary,  making  her                the love of all the predestined (Speech, May 17, 1915).                      This  little  community's  rule  proposes  devotion  to  the                most holy Virgin as an effective means to reach sanctification","and any good success. May love for the great Mother of God                and  devotion  to  her  form  a  chief  point  of  this  little  order's                spirit!  Probationers,  when  the  love  for  the  most  holy  Mary                enters our hearts, love of Jesus will reign among us (There).                      What about a .probationer whose love of the most holy                Virgin  is  indifferent?  Not  only  will  he  not  persevere  in  his                vocation, but he will also run the risk of going off course.                      This  little  community  will  honor  the  most  holy  Mary  as                Lady, mother, and protectress, paying attention to celebrating                her  novenas  and  feasts,  especially  the  Immaculate                Conception,  the  Nativity,  Our  Lady  of  Sorrows,  and  her                maternity, patronage, and Assumption. As to those of us who                are citizens of Messina, the feast of the Sacred Letter will be                at heart (P.R.P.).                      The Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus will glory in the                greatest devotion and transport of love for the great Mother of                God, the most holy Mary, who is the patroness of the order.                As much as they can, the congregants will endeavor to make   84                the  people  came  to  know  and  to  love  the  Virgin  Mary,                propagating  her  devotion  and  celebrating  her  novenas  and                feasts with greatest fervor (C.R.).                      We  must  bear  in mind  that  the  eternal Father  gave us                our Lord Jesus through the most holy Virgin Mary; that Jesus                gave  himself  up  to  us  through  Mary,  and  the  Holy  Spirit                brought about the Incarnation of the Ward by agreement with                Mary.                      Referring  to  what  was  said  neither  patriarchs  nor                prophets  nor  upright  men  obtained  the  Redeemer  in  40                centuries, but the most holy Mary obtained him in 15 years.                She was endowed with full understanding, wisdom, and the                most  elect  virtues  since  her  Immaculate  Conception.  She                knew the situation of mankind, in need of","the  Redeemer,  ardently  petitioning  God  to  send  forth  the                Messiah. From the time of her nativity until the Annunciation,                she  increased  her  longing  and  ardent  petitions  for  the                Messiah  to  came,  unaware  that  she  herself,  should  be  his                mother.                      Now, then, if the most holy Trinity gave us Jesus through                the  most  holy  Mary,  should  we  not  obtain  graces  through                her?                      Sanctification means acquiring the virtues that our Lord                Jesus  Christ  taught  us,  since  these  virtues  increase                sanctifying grace, and make us holy. St. Paul stated: « This is                God's  will  for  you:  he  wants  you  to  be  holy  »  (Thes.  4,  3).                Earlier our Lord had said: « You must be perfect just as your                Father  in  heaven  is  perfect.  »  Let  us  endeavor  to  sanctify                ourselves,  gaining  great  treasures  of  grace,  which  lead  to                eternal glory.                      Mary  is  standing  before  the  divine  treasure  of  grace.                Whoever  loves,  trusts,  invokes,  and  honors  Mary  will  grow   85                rich with abundant graces by God's will, but whoever stands                aloof has no hope, because the other exercises of devotion                will fail, and perseverance will totter.                      St.  Ignatius  of  Loyola  once  visited  a  college;  to  guess                the youths' future he asked them about their devotion to the                most holy Virgin Mary and from their answers the Saint found                the fervid and the indifferent. Later, talking with the rector in                secret he said: « The fervid will succeed, the indifferent will                not: » History confirmed his word.                      Dearest children, I know that you love the V4rgin Mary,                and I delight in it; still I exhort you to love her always more.                St. Bonaventure called the Virgin Mary « entire reason of my                hope.» In the « Hail, holy Queen », we too call her: « Life,                sweetness, and our hope! »                      May  devotion  to  the  Virgin  Mary  be  a  characteristic  of                the Rogationists, drawing upon them a special love","from the Mother of God. When Jesus reigns among the youth                of a religious institute Mary loves them, but she loves more a                community of dear children who besides devoting themselves                to charitable institutions also promote the divine command of                our Lord Jesus Christ: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the                harvest that he will send out workers to gather in his harvest.                » Of course, Our Lady takes delight in it because she knows                how  this  prayer  fosters  the  greatest  glory  of  God  and  the                good  of  souls;  therefore,  she  looks  with  particular  favor  an                this community which is the only one having such a mission                in the Church.                      The  little  seed,  however,  needs  to  grow  rich  with  holy                virtues, especially with elating love for Jesus!                      It has been many years since the hellish enemy is trying                to destroy the best part of this pious institute of the interests                of Jesus' Heart. How many times the institute has suffocated!                But  now  the  little  plant  of  the  ROGATE,  which  is  more                pregnant  far  the  Rogationists  than  the  Daughters  of  Divine                Zeal,  displays  its  little  branches,  grows  greener  every  year,   86                and stretches its roots underneath the soil. But which is the                fecund  soil,  where  the  mats  of  the  tree  stretch  and                strengthen, making the tree rise?                      My  children,  the  fecund  soil  is  holy  humility,  and  the                perfect  model,  as  well  as  divine  teacher,  is  the  most  holy                Virgin Mary... (Letter, April 1, 1922).                          15. THE MOST HOLY NAME OF MARY (6)                                                    Messina, Dec. 7, 1907                      1. I have received your request far bearing the most holy                name of Mary, august Mother of God, before the name you                providentially received in the taking of the","garb. We are delighted in your pious wish, because we have                nothing so much at heart as to put our dearest daughters in                Jesus Christ under his mast holy mother's special protection,                as well as to see them adorned and protected by such a dear                name.  This  is  more  desirable  than  any  other,  after  the                sweetest name of our Lard Jesus. We are sure that devotion                to the most holy Virgin Mary, with her powerful protection is a                sure and necessary approach to our Lord Jesus.                      After obtaining information about your religious behavior                and  your  work  of  charity  and  zeal,  it  has  come  to  my                knowledge that you fulfilled your religious duties, improved in                humility and obedience, and worked for the good of souls with                zeal and prudence.                      That you may always strive to amend your life, improve                -in humility and obedience, and be a mare tender lover of the                great Mother of God in order to attain Jesus, who is our last                aim,  by  the  authority  of  the  spiritual  directors  of  religious                institutes we grant you the privilege of bearing the most holy                name of MARY.                                             87                      From  now  on,  you  may  place  this  name  before  your                religious  name  in  word  and  writing  and  you  may  ask  the                Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  to  call  you  Mary...  in  word  and                writing.                      However, we reserve to ourselves the right to withdraw                this august, holy name, in case you become unworthy of it,                but we hope that will never happen.                                               Messina, Purification of 1917                      2.  I  have  favorably  accepted  your  request  to  bear  the                sweetest  name  of  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary  before  your                religious name...","May the sweetest name of our Mother Mary, who is our                divine  superior,  foster  your  love  for  our  supreme  goodness                Jesus,  along  with  his  most  holy  name,  improve  the  holy                virtues  for  a  full  sanctification,  and  be  a  shield  of  defense                against the assaults of the devil and the human bad will.                                                     Messina, April 7, 1922                      3. With great  pleasure I meet your request by granting                the  favor  of  bearing  the  most  holy,  sweet  name  of  MARY                before the religious name you have been given in the taking                of the garb.                      Dearest daughters, I exhort you to answer this grace as                though you were receiving it from the most holy Virgin Mary.                Please  strive  to  make  yourselves  worthy  of  bearing  it  by                imitating perfectly the most holy Mother's virtues.                      Dearest daughters, please notice that this celestial name                is granted to you today, April 7, when we are celebrating the   88                feast of Our Lady in sorrow in the Passion week. It reminds                you of Mary's faithfulness and love and of the disciple John,                standing  on  Calvary  at  the  foot  of  the  cross  near  the  great                Mother in sorrow while the apostles were absent.                      Through  this  consideration  our  Lord  and  the  mast holy                Virgin invite you to meditate every day on their suffering with                great love and compassion. Only by so doing will you grow in                divine  grace,  receive  Holy  Communion  devoutly,  observe                your rules faithfully, practice the religious virtues, and become                holy.","NOTES                     1  From our padre's spiritual notes that are called « My Lord Jesus                Christ's Imitation >> we deduce how much he strove to imitate our Lord:                                                        Trani, Sept. 10, 1910                             MY LORD JESUS CHRIST'S IMITATION                     My  Lord  Jesus  prayed  incessantly  with  recollection  during  his                tremendous suffering.                    My Lord Jesus Christ sympathized, looked for, and loved sinners.                    My Lord Jesus Christ laved, forgave, excused, and prayed for his                enemies, returning good for evil, immolating himself, and rescuing many                of them!                    My Lord Jesus Christ was meek and humble in heart.                    My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  was  subject and  obedient  to the most holy                Mary and St. Joseph.                    My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  loved  and  honored  his  holy  Mother  very                much.                    My Lard Jesus Christ not only loved suffering and dying for me, but                he suffered and died for me!                    My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  longed  and  sought  untiringly  his  Father's                glory, the highest sanctification of souls, and their salvation.   89                    My Lord Jesus Christ not only did not excuse himself when he was                strongly charged, but he kept silent.                    My Lord Jesus Christ loved the poor and consoled the afflicted.                    My Lord Jesus Christ loved and exalted children very much.                    My Lord Jesus gave himself for us.                    My  Lord  Jesus  was  most  frugal  to  drinking  and  eating,  enduring                hunger and thirst.                    My Lord Jesus spent the nights in prayer.                    My Lord Jesus wailed and prayed for the apostles' vocations and for                the saints of all times.                    My Jesus Christ was just with everyone.                    My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  taught  the  truth  without  regard  for  human                respect.                    My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  was  always  composed  and  modest  even                during his incredible suffering.                    My Jesus Christ kept even Judas' reputation jealously.                    My Jesus Christ always humbled himself before his Father; he also                humbled himself before the apostles by washing their feet.                    My Jesus Christ spent no moment without suffering, praying, and                working.                    My Jesus Christ was poor, always loving, and practicing poverty.                    My Jesus Christ was always gentle, tender, and attractive.","My Jesus Christ said only holy and perfect words.                    My Jesus Christ alternated active with contemplative life.                    My Jesus Christ observed the whale law, even the civil one, paying                the taxes to Caesar.                    My Jesus Christ avoided honors and faced contempt.                    My Jesus Christ was strong, fearless, and constant in suffering.                    My Jesus Christ loved and longed far the crass alb life long; he was                crucified and was immolated on it for my sake.                    My Jesus Christ was available to everyone; he gave himself up for                me and far all people by his life, death, and resurrection; and in the most                Holy Sacrament.                    My Jesus Christ  did  not  reveal his innermost to  the  Jews,  but  he                answered their questions properly.                    My Jesus Christ concealed' his infinite suffering under silence.                    My Jesus Christ faced contempt with meekness.                    My Jesus Christ prayed to his eternal Father, bending deeply on his                knees.                      My Jesus Christ endured and endures the elects' and the sinners'                unfaithfulness and their misery with unlimited patience.                     2  To foster holy emulation among the Religious our padre devised                the virtue contest. A poster announced the comfiest with one of these                notices: Holy humility contest - Obedience contest - Meekness contest -                Gently speaking contest - and so on. The congregants had to emulate   90                each other in a specific virtue for a period of time following the poster's                indications; Later the mother superior reported the results to our padre,                who used to make the proper remarks to the Religious.                     3  Let us make a copy of this beautiful love prayer: Jesus, I love you!                I love you, because I long to love you; I love you to satisfy your Heart's                desires; I love you to atone for the sins of the whole world; I love you to                atone for the sins I dared to commit; I love you and beg your love far my                poor heart; I love you and beg your love for all hearts; I love you for all                the hearts that do not know you; I love you for all the hearts that are                unwilling to love you; I love you for the coldest hearts; I love you in union                with the most fervent hearts; I love you for the pitiable sinners; I love you                with all the just on earth; I love and long for you together with the holy                souls that are in purgatory; I love you with all the dwellers of heaven; I                love you with Immaculate Mary always virgin; I love you because I have                firmly decided to do so until my last breath; I love you because I desire                to love you and enjoy you in paradise for ever and ever. Amen!                     4   These  sound  devotions  are  being  always  recommended  by  the                holy Church; for instance, His Holiness John XXIII talking of devotions                said: « His first year's experience in the pastoral care has given the new                bishop of Rome, the universal shepherd of the Church, the feeling that                same devout, pious souls desire to start new devotions, new","titles,  and  worship under inspiration  of local custom,  which  give much                opportunity to imagination, but little chance for the spirit's concentration.                We like inviting you to be familiar with simpler and older devotions... To                enlighten and foster the adoration to Jesus nothing is more suitable than                meditating and invoking him in the triple light of his Name, his Heart, and                his Blood... Touching upon various topics, we have come to the Calvary                where  the name  of  Jesus is  written over the  Cruclfled's  head in three                languages.  Jesus'  Heart  is  palpitating  in  his  chest,  longing  for  the                supreme sacrifice: Jesus' blood is bursting out of the opened wound, as                out of a source unexhausted and inexhaustible for life and for universal                redemption. At the foot of the cross we find two witnesses: the mother of                Jesus and his beloved disciple  » (Papal pronouncement at the end of                the Diocese's Synod, Jan. 31, 1960).                (5)    As  a  matter  of  fact,  our  padre  erected  The  Confraternity  of                Immaculate  Mary's    Heart  in  Avignone's  chapel  and  joined    it  to  the                primary one  in  Paris, and  he  ordered  that a  prayer  to  Immaculate                Mary's Heart be said every Saturday, for the conversion of sinners.                (6)   Our padre wanted the sisters professed  in  perpetual vows to join                the  name  Mary  to  their  religious  name,  but  he  granted  it  only  after                regular,  repeated  requests,  to  foster  their  desire;  he  also  worded  a                decree  of  special  privilege  which  stated  that  it  was  granted  by  the                founder. The sisters were tofd to keep the concession as a great gift and                to  imitate the  most holy   Mary's virtues.»  (VITALE:   « Fr.   Mary                Hannibal Di Francia » etc., page 287). The Padre modified the decree   91                according to circumstances as it appears from the above concessions. -","92","CHAPTER IV                                  VARIOUS DEVOTIONS                       I  will  endeavor  to  be  interiorly  pious  and  devout,                avoiding to appear so only exteriorly.                     Celebrating  the  feast and novenas  of our  Lord,  the                most  holy  Virgin,  and  the  saints,  as  we  do  in  our                Institutes, I will be recollected.                     I  will  be  affectionate  and  devout  to  the  angels  and                the  saints,  especially  to  the  Patriarch  St.  Joseph,  St.                John  the  Baptist,  St.  Michael  the  archangel,  the  holy                guardian angels, St. Anne, St. Joachim, the apostles, the                martyrs,  the  patron  saints,  the  Celestial  Rogationists,                and  the  saints  our  Institutes  honor,  especially  St.                Anthony of  Padua.                     To  my  great  pleasure  I  have  learned  that  this                Institute nurtures a particular compassion and devotion                toward the souls who are in purgatory; I will foster such                devotion by often praying for them.                       93                     I  have  also  become  aware  of  this  Institute's  pious                and beneficial customs to join pious unions of our Lord,                the  most  holy  Virgin,  the  angels,  and  to  affiliate  with                various  religious  orders  to  win  celestial  protection  and                spiritual benefits. While appreciating this divine mercy by                giving thanks to the Lord and to the superiors' charity, I                will join the most holy Virgin's slavery of love according                to the spirit of St. Louis M. Grignion.                                            1. PIETY                      What  is  an  aspirant  worth  if  he  has  no  piety?  He  is  a                useless, unfruitful tree-trunk.                     Without piety the aspirant is unable to develop religious","status, and is unable to become a good Christian. It is a pity                to see youths who are cold and indifferent in the practices of                religion, who have no disposition to devotion toward God and                the saints, and who have no particular love for the most holy                Virgin. These aspirants leave no hope for success.                      Young aspirants, if you feel cold and indifferent to piety,                please practice the religious observances, asking the Lord for                grace, enlightenment, and fervor. (R.A.).                      Remember  that  an  apostle  said:  «  Spiritual exercise  is                valuable in every way » (1 Tim. 4, 8). Piety not only includes                the strict union of hearts in the common devotion to God, but                also the practices that foster and maintains such a devotion                to God, the most holy Virgin, and the saints (P.R.P.).                      The  congregants  will  endeavor  to  be  sincerely  and                interiorly pious and devout while worshipping God and when                honoring the most holy Virgin and the saints. They will nurture                the most tender love toward the adorable Lord Jesus Christ,                meditating  on  his  love  and  his  suffering  for  us  every  day.   94                They will celebrate with devotion, with an intimate feeling of                faith, reverence, and love the mysteries and the feasts, which                the holy Church celebrates (C.R.).                      The  novices  will  practice  simple,  sincere,  and  fervent                piety without affectation, scruples, and illusions, and cultivate                the substance of piety more than its forms. Specifically, they                will cultivate the following:                      1.  Devotion  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  -  Because  the                novices are consecrated to the Divine Heart, they will honor it                by  meditating  on  its  Passion  and  by  fostering  its  interests.                They  will  also  nurture  particular  devotion  to our  Lord  Jesus                Christ  in  the  mysteries  of  his  Infancy,  Passion,  and  Holy                Sacrament.","2.  Devotion  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary.  -  They  will                honor  and  hold  her  as  mother,  specifically  praying  to  the                Immaculate  Heart  of  Mary,  which  forms  one  Heart  with  the                most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  far  the  conversion  of  sinners                (R.L.P.).                      By faith, they will always see the guardian angel on their                side  giving  him  the  precedence,  and  will  be  particularly                devout  to  the  Patriarch  St.  Joseph,  founder  of  the  Little                Retreat, and special patron of the pious institute, invoking him                in the morning and at night (R.L.P.).                      Both  superiors  and  subjects  must  be  diligent  to                constantly improve the observance of the religious practices,                beginning  with  the  meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our  Lord                Jesus  Christ  in  the  morning,  and  the  Last  Things  or  divine                benefits in the evening, and consider the inner pains of our                Lord every  day.  We also  must be  attentive  to  celebrate  the                ecclesiastical feasts and ours such as the first-fruits, July first,                the  vigils,  the  monthly  devotions,  the  most  holy  name  of                Jesus along with the presentation of our petition, etc.; as well   95                as  the  virtue  contest about humility,  obedience,  and mutual                charity (Resolves, June 17, 1920) .                      The Rogationists will foster devotion to the saints, giving                the preference to the ones who are nearest to our Lord Jesus                Christ  and  the  most  holy  Virgin.  Because  the  Rogationist                institute's aim is obedience to the command of Jesus: « Pray,                therefore,... », the congregants will be particularly devout to                the apostle saints, especially Peter, Paul, and the evangelist                John, saying a specific prayer to each of them on their feast.                      The  least  congregation  of  the  Rogationists  must  never                forget that it is greatly indebted to the glorious St. Anthony of                Padua  for  its  economical  existence  as  well  as  for  many                spiritual gifts; therefore, it will foster in particular,","a special particular devotion to this great saint, honoring him                during  the  year,  especially  on  Feb.  15  and  on  June  13                (R.R.C.).                      So that worship to God and devotion to the saints may                proceed regularly and effectively, we are obliged to observe                the .liturgical rules, making use of statues and sacred images.                So  that  the  Rogationists  and  their  employees  may  enjoy                abundantly spiritual benefits and a more effective protection                of our Lord Jesus Christ, the most holy Virgin, the angels, and                the  saints  they  will  join  many  pious  unions  in  the  Church                without obligation of conscience.                                      2. MEDITATION                      Christian,  religious  life  cannot  exist  without  meditation                and  prayer;  both  are  indispensable  for  attaining  en-                lightenment and help from heaven.                      The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  be  fond  of  prayer,   96                knowing  that  without  it  they  will  be  unable  to  do  anything                good,  nor  will  they  be  capable  to  improve  holy  virtues.  By                neglecting prayer they will lose any good, their vocation, and                their own soul as well.                 a) Meditation and Communion                      I heartily exhort the Daughters of Divine Zeal to be fond                of  meditation,  because  it  is  the main  preparation  to  receive                Communion  worthily,  and  because  it  nurtures  the  spirit  of                effective  prayer  to  win  any  grace  from  God;  furthermore,                meditation prompts the soul to reach the highest perfection.                      The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  must  be  convinced  that                they  will  never  receive  a  profitable  Communion  without                prayer, that their existence as a religious institute","is tied to Jesus in the Holy Eucharist, and that if the spirit of                prayer is lacking everything will come to nothing.                      My daughters in Jesus Christ, you must understand that                your individual spirituality and growth in holiness as well as                the  institute's  temporal  existence  and  improvement  depend                on your receiving the Eucharistic Communion frequently and                worthily through prayer; otherwise Jesus will became greatly                disgusted and will stop giving spiritual and temporal graces.                Remember that your name is Daughters of Divine Zeal. But,                can  you  be  zealous  for  the  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests  if  you                wound  him  with  your  receiving  Communion  unworthily?  By                doing so everything will end such as the spirit of prayer to win                good workers to the holy Church, your holy zeal for winning                souls, and you yourselves, will no longer be good educators                of  the  girls  who  are  entrusted  to  you.  Oh,  what  a  ruin  the                Communion  you  receive  unworthily  will  bring  about!  If  you                neglect meditation, prayer will fail and sterility will result. (1)                  b) Meditation and Prayer                                  97                      Both  philosophers  and  experience  teach  that  our  will                keeps still if the mind does not know its own good. In other                terms,  O  soul,  if  you  do  not  know  how  desirable  and                beneficial the virtue is, you will not ask God for it; neither will                you endeavor to achieve it through your own cooperation.                      We  are  pointing  out  that  the  effort  of  prayer  and                cooperation in achieving a virtue or a grace is always relative                and  proportionate  to  the  mind's  spiritual  knowledge  or                enlightenment about that virtue or grace.  If the mind knows                nothing about the beauty, excellence, and usefulness of such                a  virtue  or  grace,  it  will  never  be  moved  to  pray  and                cooperate. If the mind's knowledge about a virtue or grace is                weak and only speculative and","superficial, but is not at all acquired by the gift of the intellect,                the  will  shall  move  weakly  and  superficially  to  pray  and                cooperate. On the contrary, if enlightenment and knowledge                of faith and the Holy Spirit make the mind fully aware of the                beauty, excellence, and usefulness of such a virtue or grace,                the whole will shall move entirely and effectively to pray and                cooperate in order to acquire that virtue or that grace.                      The mind’s enlightenment and knowledge must not be a                simple,  natural,  speculative  knowledge  as  the  following                statement, for instance - virtue is desirable - because no one                is  moved  to  achieve  the  virtue  by  such  knowledge.  In  fact,                many people who stand aloof from God know that God may                punish them in this life and after death for their sins, but that                does not matter, they continue sinning.                      Now, prayer or meditation is the indispensable condition                to  achieve  this  enlightenment  and  knowledge  about  grace                and faith.                      Daughters in Jesus Christ, please pay careful attention   98                to  the  great  importance  of  the  connection  between                meditation, prayer, and cooperation in order to achieve grace,                good, and sanctification from God. (2)                      As  to  the  connection  between  effective  prayer  and                cooperation in the spiritual order, please note: on one hand                the  grace  sets  the  will  in  motion,  and  the  good  will  moves                along with the grace; on the other hand, meditation impels the                will always to greater activity through the enlightenment of the                mind; once the will is moved, it determines a way, with all its                strength, to attain the spiritual objectives, through prayer and                cooperation.                      Prayer without cooperation, however, is as imperfect as                it  is  ineffective.  For  instance,  if  a  person  meditates  on  the                humiliations our Lord suffered for our sake, resolving","to acquire holy humility at any cost, and prays for it, such a                prayer, to be effective, needs the cooperation of the person                who wishes holy humility and prays for it. 4n other terms, this                person  has  to  accomplish  what  is  necessary  to  achieve                humility,  such  as  humiliating  himself  in  case  of  warning,                choosing the last place, practicing the humblest jobs through                obedience, loving and practicing poverty, begging pardon and                penance for his faults, and the like.                      This spiritual order is the same for any virtue.                     By adding our cooperation we make the prayer effective,                while  our  meditation  moves  us  to  pray  and  to  cooperate                (S.D.D.Z.).                  c) Meditation and Perfection                      The daily meditation is the first means which increases                our awareness of the divine presence making it visible to the                mysterious  view  of  faith.  It  is  the  source  from  whence  we                derive both the principle for any action and the ignition for the   99                enlivening flame of charity and zeal (Speech, April 17, 1915).                      To form the interior spirit and to perform everything for                the  sake  of  our  adorable  Lord  Jesus,  nothing  is  more                efficacious  than  holy  prayer.  It  unveils  our  defects  and  bad                inclinations,  makes  the  soul  hate  them  and  long  for                evangelical perfection, and for the kingdom of God, which is                given  to  those  who  long  and  strive  to  reach  it.  May  the                probationers  be  fond  of  prayer,  without  allowing  boredom,                due  to  their  weak  nature,  or  temptation  during  the  prayer                prevails over. Jesus Christ said: « Keep watch and pray so                that you will not fail into temptation. The spirit is willing, but                the flesh is weak » (Mt. 26, 41). (P.R.P.).                          My dear, we must be convinced of eternity, which is","waiting  for  us  with  a  new  order  beyond  the  time  and  the                boundaries  of  this  mortal  life!  We  are  pilgrims  in this  world.                God  placed  us  here  for  a  short  time,  to  test  and  make  us                worthy  of  an  eternal  prize.  Here  nothing  lasts,  everything                camas  to  an  end,  time  flies rapidly;  today  you  are  children,                tomorrow youths, the day after tomorrow old, at last eternity                comes!                      Millions  and  millions  of  human  beings,  who  dwelt  on                earth long ago, took this course; they came to life, laved, and                died. We are on the same run.                      Who may exactly value the importance and the neces-                sity of meditation on eternal truths? Meditation should be the                daily bread of our spirit! If we did it, we would become like the                just in the words of the prophet: « Happy the man who... finds                his pleasure in the law of Yahweh, and murmurs his law day                and night. He is like a tree planted by water streams, yielding                its fruit in season, its leaves never fading! » (Ps. 1, 1-3).                      If meditation is necessary to everyone, how much more   100                necessary it is for you, O clerics. You need to grow in grace                and  wisdom  as  the  adorable  Savior  did,  gaining  favor  with                God  and  with  people.  You  need  to  sanctify  yourselves  and                now is the time! While you are young, while in training, you                can  strive  to  root  out  the  nascent  passions,  in  order  to                become obedient to the grace working in you. Please starts                the work of your sanctification... start it through meditation an                eternal truths.                      If  we  often  meditated  an  the  truths  of  faith, if  we  were                often in the divine presence, if we were fond of prayer, if we                prayed for hours, if we were fully aware of the mysteries of                faith in our actions all day long, what mutations would happen                in us! Bit by bit, a ray of God's infinite splendor would enter                us,  our  mind  would  be  filled  with  divine  light;  and  darkness                would be driven away.","through divine light we would know how to abhor evil, how to                embrace good, while a celestial fire would inflame our heart                and move our will effectively. If we persevered in the exercise                of meditation, we would become holy; on the contrary, if we                are  cool  and  attached  to  many  things,  if  our  passions  are                alive, if our mind is dull, if we are lacking virtues, all this is                due  to  our  lack  of  meditation.  We  do  not  nurture  our  spirit,                and it becomes exhausted; we deny ourselves the bread of                life,  and  it  is  always  remains  as  faint  as  dying;  the  spirit’s                eyes  are  blind,  its  ears  are  deaf,  its  palate  does  savor  the                taste  of  the  celestial  things  any  longer.  Thus,  while  the                starving spirit declines, the body boldly takes over. In short, if                we  do  not  become  spiritual,  it  is  because  of  our  lack  of                meditation (Speech, Oct. 1891).                                3.THE FRUIT OF MEDITATION                         The  morning  meditation  must  be  on  the  most  holy                passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. While meditating, the soul                will imagine the scene or the picture of the meditation event,   101                such  as  the  garden,  the  arrest,  the  courts,  the  insults,  the                scourging, the way of the Calvary, etc.                        After  doing  so,  the  soul  reflects,  discusses  things,                considers.                        Sentiments, prayers, and resolves are the three items                on which the fruit of meditation rests. Specifically they are the                exercise  of  loving  feelings  toward  the  suffering  Jesus,  the                petition to know, love, and serve him with humility and fervor,                the determined resolves to never offend him, to amend, and                the like.","SENTIMENTS.  To  excite  the  sentiments,  you  need  to                consider two main factors:                      1.  Jesus  suffered  for  you  in  a  particular  way  what  he                suffered  for  all,  as  if  you  were  the  only  person  to  be                redeemed.                      2. To redeem you, the shedding of a single drop of his                blood,  or  enduring  the  lightest  annoyance,  or  uttering  a                simple prayer to his eternal Father would have been enough.                Why, during his whole life, beginning with his incarnation, did                he  want  to  suffer  so  many  spiritual;  infinite pains?  Why  the                hardship,  discomfort,  continuous  want,  and  the  Passion  of                incredible  torments  in  his  most  delicate  members,  the                agonies  of  his  loving  Heart,  all  of  which,  the  human  mind                cannot understand? Why did he want to be wholly ruined and                consumed with so many pains, each one more terrible than                the other, and he suffered everything for you, when, in fact,                he  could  have  saved  you  without  the  suffering?  You  must                know it: he did so in order to oblige you to love him!                                                                          102                     You  will  meditate  on the  adorable  Passion of  our  Lord                Jesus Christ with these ideas as well as with those that your                love will excite; when the Lord brings into evidence to you the                sufferings he endured for your sake, and you find one of them                overcoming and winning you to his Heart, then you will gay                with great affection: « My love, it is enough, stop suffering: I                surrender  myself  to  your  love;  see  to  it  that  I  endure  the                remnant  of  your  Passion,  dying  for  you.  »  Then,  if  you  are                truly humble, penitent, and loving, you will add what the Lord                inspires you to say. (3)                      PRAYERS. Besides the sentiments, the prayers are also                the result of meditation. We need to profit by the","precious time of meditation, when the soul is in union with                God, to ask the graces and mercies of which we are in need                (the  prayer  itself  will  show  us).  We  have  to  ask  the  divine                lover  for  forgiveness  of  our  sins,  holy  per-severance,  and                holy virtues praying ardently for the adorable Heart of Jesus'                interests, for sending out good workers to the holy Church,                and for the conversion of sinners.                      RESOLVES. Because the resolves are the outcome of                meditation,  they  must  never  be  neglected.  When  a  person                during the meditation is moved and afflicted for the most holy                Passion of Jesus Christ, she will promise to never grieve him                again, to amend from the defects in which she usually falls,                and to practice specific virtues; as well as to overcome the                predominant  passion,  to  control  herself  when  she  is                humiliated, to observe the rules of the institute, and the like.                      When a person practices meditation in such a way, she                will rapidly grow in holiness (S.D.D.Z.).                                                                           103                                 4. ETERNAL TRUTHS                      The  probationers  will  meditate  together  every  day,  in                the morning and in the evening, making use of some book.                The  topics  of  their  meditation  will  be  the  Last  Things,  the                mysteries of our Lord Jesus Christ and his divine mother, the                divine perfections, and the divine benefits, either general or                particular.  Their  favorite  topic,  how-ever,  will  be  the                meditation on the inner pains of the most holy Heart of Jesus                (P.R.P.).                      The  sisters  will  meditate  together  three  times:  in  the                morning  before  the  mass,  for  at  least  half  an  hour,  in  the                afternoon for fifteen minutes on the Heart of Jesus' inner","pains, in the evening for fifteen minutes alternatively on the                eternal truths and the divine benefits.                      Since meditation on the eternal truths pervades the soul                with holy fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom, it is                of great importance. This meditation instills the beneficial fear                of sin in the soul as the Holy Spirit, said: « In everything you                do, remember your end, and you will never sin » (Eccl. 7, 40).                Hence  no  sister  will  consider  the  meditation  an  death,                particular or  universal  judgment  of God,  hell  and  its  eternal                suffering,  abomination  of  sin,  and  punishment  of  God  on                earth  and  after  death  as  it  were  unnecessary.  The  Eternal                Truths and The Way to Salvation by St. Alphonsus M. Liguori                are of help to meditating (S.D.D.Z.).                                  5. THE DIVINE BENEFITS                      The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  are  bound  in  duty  to                meditate  on  the  divine  benefits  of  natural  and  supernatural                order  that  each  and  all  of  them  received  generously  from   104                God.                      Nurturing in their heart an intimate gratitude toward the                divine, eternal benefactor God the Father, the Son, and the                Holy  Spirit  for  the  creation,  redemption,  and  the  means  of                sanctification, the sisters will never neglect the meditation on                the divine benefits in order to excite their intimate feelings of                thanksgiving,  praise,  and  blessings  toward  Gad,  the  most                holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the angels and the saints.                      To foster gratitude and to frequently thank the Lord, the                booklet by Sarnelli on the Divine Benefits is of great help.                      A breath or a bit of bread or a little useful abject cannot                be underestimated, because it is a grace coming","from the Lord. We have to get used to consider everything as                a great gift of the Lord, as it really is. For instance, if you get a                pin you need, please say in your inner-most, a thanks, God;                how great your goodness is! » or the like. No gift is a little one                when it comes from God, or from the divine Heart of Jesus                that  shelters  the  infinite,  eternal  love  of  God  for  human                beings. If we have faith, we will not think of finding a pin by                chance, by coincidence; on the contrary we will see Jesus as                handing  it  to  us!  If  we  do  that,  no  thing  will  be                underestimated. If we had the spirit of the saints, we would be                enraptured  by  the  consideration  of  God's  goodness  who                prompts the object we need. Let us acquire at least the spirit                of meditation through our efforts and the divine grace in order                that we may thank the divine goodness for anything, without                underestimating  even  the  small  things.  If  we  happen  to                marvel at the consideration of what a pin or a bit of bread is in                God,  who  created  them  through  so  many  causes,  our                marveling will be the result of our meditation.                                                                          105                     For instance, let us pick up a bit of bread. Made of flour                and  water,  it  is  cooked  in  the  oven.  Flour  comes  from  the                harvest's  seeds  of  wheat.  But  the  harvest,  on  its  turn,  is                produced  by  other  seeds  of  previous  harvests,  and  so  on                back through sixty centuries since the creation of the world.                Providence  kept  fructifying  the  harvest,  which  gave  those                seeds of wheat, which made the bit of bread, which you are                about  to  eat.  If  it  is  possible,  let  us  number  the  millions  of                people  who  worked  through  the  centuries  to  produce  these                harvests, considering how many times the sun, the earth, and                the  rain  fecundated  them;  how  many  wooden  or  iron  tools,                which  imply  millions  of  people  and  minds  working  to  form                them, were used! Flour, which made the bit of bread that you                swallow and consume","in a moment, was produced in the mill. Haw many things are                needed to form the mill? Iron was taken from the bowels of                earth;  linen  was  produced  by  the  plants  that  bred  on  earth                along  the  centuries,  wood...  etc.  Forming  a  bit  of  bread                implies millions of people and minds! Please make your paint:                along the centuries God preserved millions of people to form                that bit of bread that only you are eating; in fact, only you are                eating the bit of bread God gave you. We could reasoning the                same way of the water which was used to work into dough; of                how it came down from the clouds, went to the sea, and went                back  to  the  clouds  by  evaporation  over  and  over  again  by                millions of times. We could say the same thing of how that bit                of  bread  was  cooked:  we  would  number  more  millions  of                people  and  minds  who  worked  for  the  linen,  bricks,  coal,                transfer of stuff, linen, and so on... to form that bit of bread!                      We  cannot  consider  this  bit  of  bread  a  least  benefit  of                God; we cannot swallow it without at least saying: «O infinite                goodness  of  God  who  thought  of  m$  through  so  many                centuries  and  engaged  innumerable  human  beings,  as  well   106                as  elements  from  the  natural  world  with  continuous  loving                care, to prepare this bit of bread for me! For me, when I was                not yet born!                      The  Lord  provided  us  with  innumerable  kinds  of  flood,                linen, clothing, houses, and comforts of life; an each of these                objects  we  could  reason,  contemplate,  and  find  out  more                millions of creatures and minds that worked for us, for each of                us under the Providence's guide!                      Can we say, then, that the pin we found, when we were                in need of it, is a thing of little value, instead of saying that it is                a divine benefit? We could reason in the same way for a sip                of water or for whatsoever little object.","The Lord said that the hairs of our head have been all                counted and no one of them falls without divine disposition.                This  saying  teaches  that  even  the  lightest  or  the  most                irrelevant happening as, for instance, the timely recovery of a                pin, is grace and kindness of our loving God and a proof of                his continuous care for each creature.                      If departing from the marvels of the divine omnipotence                and  his  goodness  in  forming  a  bit  of  bread  or  some-thing                useful,  we  proceed  to  the  reign  of  grace,  we  will  discover                greater  and  sublime  marvels  by  considering  what  the  Lord                did, operated, and suffered to give each one of us even the                least  grace!  Each  person  would  say:  «  The  divine  Word                became man for me, suffered 34 years for me... is dwelling in                the Holy Sacrament for me; He created the angels, his most                holy  mother,  and  the  saints  for  me;  He  formed  the  holy                Church,  the  doctors,  the  preachers,  the  confessors,  the                pontiffs,  the  bishops,  the  priests,  the  temples,  the  religious                orders, etc., for me.                                                                          107                The  point  of  fact  is  that  Christians  share  in  everything                because they belong to God's family through the communion                of the saints. A word or an enlightenment of the mind leading                to goodness holds the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ as well                as the prayers and works of the most holy Virgin, the angels,                the saints, the Church, and the just all over the world!                      0 soul, please see how each ,person is bound in duty to                always  thank  God,  the  most  holy  august  Trinity,  for  the                benefits he receives as though he were alone on earth!                      While traveling and thirsty, St. Teresa was given a cup of                water by a charitable 'person, whom she never forgot in her                prayer to the Lord. Because any good comes from God, we                are  not  afraid  of making  a mistake  by  saying  that  the  saint                thanked the Lord for that cup of water all her life long.","Following this example, we have to remember any good                encounter  in  order  to  thank  the  Lord  either  with  a  simple                thought or an internal act by saying for instance, « My Jesus,                I thank you for that factor event or preservation or encounter.                » Even though these things seem to be trifling matter, really                they are not because they were disposed by divine wisdom.                      We  also  add  that  the  events  or  things  or  apposition  or                suffering that are unpleasant to the senses or to the spirit are                worth  our  thanksgiving,  because  everything,  even  God's                punishment, depends on Him and is for our good. Owing to                these considerations, we must thank God.                      Happy the person who goes deeply into the science of                gratitude  we  owe  to  God  for  everything,  great  or  small,                prosperous  or  unpleasant  thanking  Him  not only  when  they                come  to  pass,  but  also  when  she  remembers  them                (S.D.D.Z.).                              6. IMPEDIMENTS TO MEDITATION                  108                      1.  Distractions.  We  have  voluntary  and  involuntary                distractions. The voluntary distractions are sins more or less                grave depending on our awareness and consent of our will to                them.  Because  they  destroy  the  fruit  of  the  prayer,  making                matters  worse,  the  person  has  to  battle  vigorously  against                them.  The  involuntary  distractions  are  those  that  are                opposed, rejected, and disliked.                      As long as one strives hard to dispel the distractions in                order to remain in the divine presence and to meditate with                affection,  prayer,  and  resolves,  the  involuntary  distractions                are not at all sins. The fathers of spirit hold that meditation is                beneficial  even  when  all  of  the  time  is  spent  in  dispelling                distractions.                      However,  the  people  must  know  that  they  may  be                responsible for the distractions that enter. No one can","say,  «  I  am  not  responsible.  »  In  fact,  distractions  mainly                come in because we are not mortified nor dead to ourselves.                      It  is  worse  when  distractions  arise  because  of  our                previous  dissipation,  which  originate  from  talking  vainly,                having attachments, and the like. Usually the chief cause of                distractions  during  meditation  is  attachment,  because  the                object or the people to whom we are attached come to our                mind.  If  opposed  and  rejected,  these  distractions  are                involuntary in act, but voluntary in cause, but dispelling them                is  harder,  however,  because  of  their  voluntary  cause.  A                mortified,  diligent  person  seldom  undergoes  distractions                during  meditation,  and  when  it  does  hap-pen  she  dispels                them easily.                      Hence,  everyone  will  deduce  how  much  she  must                humiliate  herself  before  God  because  of  the  distractions                which interfere with meditation; and even though there is no                sin  in  act  when  she  regrets,  retracts,  and  condemns  the                causes, still she must plead guilty before God. Retracting the   109                cause of  distractions is truly sincere when the soul amends                her attachments and the daily dissipations as well as devotes                herself to mortification and exercise of holy humility.                      Besides doing so, the soul has to spray fervently to the                Lord in order to win over distractions, or better yet, to impede                them  from  oppressing  during the meditation,  and  the  Lord's                help will not fail, because he said: « Without me you can do                nothing » (Jan. 15, 5).                 2. Temptations. To impede the soul to take advantage from                the meditation, the never sleeping hellish enemy is always on                guard  fostering  distractions  and  causing  temptations  by                exploiting the human failings of the soul.                         As  to  the  temptations,  we  emphasize  that  having  a                way of living which gives the enemy the opportunity of","tempting  us  during  the  meditation  is  like  giving  weapons  to                our enemy. To win the temptations we must be mortified.                      Consenting to the enemy's temptations is a grave, mortal                sin if the object to which we consent with full deliberation is                grave. To easily repel the enemy's temptations at their rising                as  well  as  to  become  quick  to  repel  them  during  the                meditation,  everyone  must  take  diligent  care  to  become                mortified.  Each  one  must  beware  of  giving  our  enemy                opportunity  of  perilous  temptations  by  putting  herself  in  the                occasion; for instance, if someone complains with the people                against  the  superior's  orders,  the  enemy  finds  that,  person                inclined to insubordination and may urge her to disobey or to                fight by pride: on the other hand, the person who is already                inclined to disobey, may consent to it. Usually the temptation                pattern is always the same, but the skillful enemy knows very                well either the temptation he is going to use or the passions                he is going to stir to make the soul fall into his snare.                      To overcome distractions we must pray, but to conquer                the  temptations  we  must  pray  more.  By  combining    110                mortification  and  the  avoidance  of  occasions  with  fervent                prayer to the adorable Hearts of Jesus and Mary we obtain                the grace to overcome the temptations.                      3. Sleep. Sleep is a great enemy to same people while                meditating. St. John Climacus holds that sweep derives from                the devil's temptation, exploiting the sours laziness or from a                weak  nature  or  from  abundant  food  or  from  the  habit  of                sleeping excessively. It may also derive from lack of sufficient                sleep. Sleeping during the meditation is a great thief, since it                steals the whole profit of meditation when the soul consents                to it without striving to prevail over.","How to battle against sleep in order to prevail over it? By                a  determined  will  and  by prayer.  The  people  taking  care of                their spiritual good do their best to overcome sleep during the                meditation. 0 soul, when you are troubled with sleep, hate it,                moan, humiliate yourself, and pray over again to the adorable                Heart  of  Jesus;  Immaculate  Mary,  your  patron  angels  and                saints; do novenas and penance.                      To dispel sleep during the meditation, you will use some                practical means such as standing and kneeling alternatively,                without  leaning  on  the  pew  and  without  putting  your  hands                before your eyes. It is also advisable that the superior entrust                someone  with  awakening  the  lazy.  In  a  community,  those                who slept during the meditation were ordered by the superior                to  plead  guilty  in  public  and  to  skip  breakfast;  this  policy                produced a quick improvement, making evident that good will                is  sometimes  lacking,  while  appropriate,  sensitive  penance                proves useful.                      Should sleep derive from overwork or lack of sleep-time,                the superior will remedy the situation.                   111                       4. Aridity. It may originate from present or past faults that                are under punishment by the Lord. In this case, the person                must humiliate herself remaining steady in the meditation by                operating  with  a  pure  will.  If  she  consents  to  aridity  and                surrenders to it, she loses the benefit of the .meditation and                comes out of it worse.                      When the person remains steady, operating with will and                mind,  even  though  without  sensible  pleasure,  she  loses                nothing from meditation, on the contrary she makes a point                by  using  aridity  in  order  to  purify  herself  and  to  improve                firmness and virtue. After showing her faithfulness in this way,                the  divine  groom  will  make  her  feel  his  presence  in  faith,                while  darkness  of  aridity  will  vanish,  and  the  rays  of  the                groom's face will shine.","7.     SPIRITUAL READING                      Since  it  is an  important  factor  of  sanctification,  spiritual                reading  will  be  always  in  force  in  our  houses.  When  the                people  listen  to  it  in  silence  with  interior  and  exterior  quiet,                they seem to be meditating. Spiritual reading may be public                or private.                      Successful  spiritual  reading  is  like  a  beneficial,  gentle                rain  which  irrigates  the  soul,  penetrates  the  heart  sweetly,                and spreads wide inside the person to her great pleasure and                profit.  In  the  meditation  one  may  not  always  be  able  or                disposed to attract the stream of grace in a sensible way, or                she has to make many efforts; in spiritual reading instead, the                soul  receives  the  sweet  stream  of  grace  passively  and                specifically. To profit by it, each one must be attentive, as if                Jesus  himself  were  speaking  to  her  with  the  wards  of  that                took; in fact, any good spiritual reading is from God.                      a)  Reading  in  common.  The  superior  will  take  care  to                appoint the readers by turns, choosing the ablest ones. Light,   112                hoarse  or  unpleasant  voices  must  not  be  considered.  Even                though they may be few, the people having sound, pleasant                voices  and  an  understanding  of  the  reading,  take  turns,                adapting the voice modulation. The superior will see to it that                the  reading  to  well  timed,  and  the  punctuation  marks                observed.  If  the  readers  will  follow  these  rules  exactly,                reading  clearly  and  contritely,  the  message  will  enter  the                hearers'  soul  sweetly  and  pleasantly.  They  will  be  like                evangelical  preachers  proclaiming  the  word  of  God.                Furthermore, if the readers have the intention of sharing the                hearers' merits as well as the merits that the people loose for                their  fault,  they  will  share  in  them.  Everyone  attending  the                reading  will  pay  careful  attention  to  it,  dispelling  any                distraction  as  well  as  gathering  and  keeping  the  reading's                divine teaching in their heart.","b)  Reading  in  private.  Private  reading  is  also  of  great                profit to the soul. By permission of the superior or the master                each one may make use of a book she considers useful. If                you  happen  to  feel  drawn  to  meditate  on  some  specific                passage  while  reading,  please  do  it  because  it  will  be                helpful.                      c)  Books of spiritual reading. Books of spiritual reading,                either  public  or  private,  are  allowed  after  having  been                previously examined. When a youth enters the community,                her  books  must  be  examined  in  order  to  destroy  those  of                unsound  doctrine.  Reading  books  written  by  saints  are                preferable to the works by modern authors about perfection.                They may be used with permission along with the Rodriguez                treatise.  The  book  of  books,  however,  is  the  Holy  Gospel                according  to  the  four  evangelists.  Reading  it  frequently,                especially  in  the  month  of  June,  which  is  dedicated  to  the                most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  is  strongly  suggested.  You  will                also read the remnant books of the New Testament as word                of God. Those of the Old Testament are also beautiful and of   113                great  profit,  especially  the  Psalms  by  David,  the  books  of                Wisdom, and the Prophets: some others, however, are to be                left out of your reading.                      Books of passion, such as novels, must be absolutely                avoided,  even  though  they  combine  profane  with  sacred                ideas. « Fabiola » only, by Card. Wiseman, may be admitted                because of its edifying reading (S.D.D.Z.).                                         8. PRAYER                      Interior life, union with God, zeal, charity, and thirst for                souls  give  the  people  of  God  a  great  weapon  to  per-form                great  things  for  the  Lord  and  for  souls,  not  through  their                personal work, sacrifices, money, and talent, but","through  the  invisible,  or  better  yet,  the  visible  help  of  the                divine  power.  This  weapon,  which  helps  us  prevail  over                everything,  this  golden  key,  which  opens  the  treasure  of                divine  grace,  is  prayer.  A  servant  of  God  (14  said  this                impressive, unforgettable sentence in his preaching: « God is                omnipotent, but prayer is the most omnipotent! » Just so! If                we  priests  or  those  bound  in  duty  to  save  souls  used  it                always, the Church's mystical fields would blossom (Speech,                April 17, ...)!                      God gave us prayer as the great means to win any grace                and the probationers will pray every day considering it as the                divine treasure's key. Please exhort the probationers to hold                prayer in great esteem, and to implore from God the victory                over  themselves,  as  well  as  divine  love,  the  spirit  of  holy                virtues, the achievement of their aim, .perseverance, a good                death,  and  eternal  life.  Since  the  lovers  of  God  desire  the                good of others as well as their own, the probationers of this                little  community,  which  is  devoted  to  the  adorable  Heart  of                Jesus' consolation, will also pray for the interests of the divine                Heart every day... basing their hope of improvement on the   114                spirit of prayer. If they pray, everything will be well; if prayer is                lacking, the source of grace will become dry, and everything                will came to nothing. May God avoid that (P.R.P.)!                  a) importance of prayer                      Everyone  will  hold  prayer  in  great  esteem,  dedicating                himself to it all life long, because our Lord wanted all graces                to depend on it. He said: « Ask, and you will receive; seek,                and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you »                (Mt. 7, 7). Let us bring into focus two points: necessity and                efficacy of the prayer.                          1. Necessity of prayer. The theologians teach that","prayer is absolutely necessary for our eternal salvation, and                without prayer no one can be saved. Our Lord Jesus Christ                recommended it to us over and over again teaching us how to                pray, especially through the Our Father, nearly compelling us                to pray following his own example. Even though he needed                no prayer to obtain graces, being himself omnipotent God like                the Father and the Holy Spirit, still he always prayed to win                graces  from  the  eternal  Father  for  the  holy  Church  and  for                souls until the end of the time. All graces, the least and the                greatest  as  well  as  the  spiritual  and  temporal  which  are                granted to the creatures on earth were obtained and prepared                by  Jesus,  our  supreme  goodness,  through  his  divine,                continuous prayers.                      But  even  though  he obtained  and  prepared the  graces                for  us,  by  divine  decree  no  grace  comes  to  us  without  the                cooperation  of  our  prayer.  Prayer  is  the  opening  key  of  the                infinite  treasure  of  graces.  No  prayer,  no  grace.  The  souls                that  ask  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  will  receive.  Both                credited  revelations  and  interpretations  of  many  passages   115                from the prophets say that even though our Lord Jesus Christ                is the author of any grace, still he prayed for himself to win                from his Father the help and strength his most holy humanity                needed to work out our redemption.                      If our Lord prayed to win grace for himself from God, and                he  had  no  need  to  do  so,  who  can  obtain  graces  from  the                Lord without praying? Just as our Lord Jesus Christ prayed,                so did the most holy Immaculate Mary all her life long, in spite                of  being  born  holiest  and  unable  to  fall  into  the  least                imperfection. And yet, she prayed in every moment of her life                for  herself  and  for  others;  in  union  with  the  prayers  of  our                Lord  Jesus  Christ  she  obtained  and  prepared  the  graces                necessary for our salvation and","sanctification. She obtained and prepared them, but we are                bound in absolute duty to ask for them through prayer.                      The saints were wisest in profiting by this great means.                To be saved, to improve heroic virtues, to conquer and throw                down any inordinate passion, overcome any difficulty, prevail                over  wonders,  the  saints  prayed  continuously.  They                cooperated  by  hard  work  and  sacrifices.  Works  and                sacrifices,  however,  would  have  been  of  no  value  without                fervent  and  continuous  prayer:  Both the  uselessness  of  our                efforts and the necessity of prayer for our sanctification are                pointed out by these words of our Lord Jesus Christ: « You                can do nothing without me » (Jn. 15, 5). It is obvious that we                can do no goad far ourselves and others without the help and                the  enlightenment  of  our  Lord,  but  we  can  obtain  this  help                and enlightenment by praying.                      2.  Efficacy  of  prayer.  Prayer  is  necessary  because  our                Lord grants no grace without prayer; the sacred writers say                that  prayer  is  as  necessary  for  spiritual  life as  breath  is  for                natural life because prayer is the breath of the soul. Prayer is   116                also as necessary as it is effective. This is a consoling truth,                because if we pray with faith, fervor, and due dispositions our                prayer reaches Gad, obtaining what we ask for.                      This certainty is based on this promise of our Lord Jesus                Christ:  «  Ask,  and  you  will  receive;  seek,  and  you  will  find;                knock, and the door will be opened to you» (Mt. 7, 7). He also                narrated the parable of the friend knocking at a friend's door                and  asking  for  three  loaves  (Lk.  11,  5-8)  as  well  as  the                parable  of  the  widow  who  got  justice  from  an  unjust  judge                who was reluctant to do so (Lk. 18, 1-8). On another occasion                he said: «Would any of you who are fathers give your son a                snake when he asks","for fish? Or would you give him a scorpion when he asks for                an  egg?  As  bad  as  you  are,  you  know  how  to  give  good                things to your children. How much more, then, the Father in                heaven will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him » (Lc.                11, 11-13)!                      Besides,  he  solemnly  said:  «  I  tell  you  the  truth:  the                Father  will  give  you  whatever  you  ask  of  Him  in  my  name.                Until now you have not asked for anything in my name; ask                and you will receive, so that your happiness may be complete                (Jn. 16, 23-24). If you ask me for anything in my name, I will                do in) (Jn. 14, 14). Given all these solemn promises, who can                doubt about the prayer's divine efficacy? Who can doubt that                the Lord hears us? Is there any excuse for those who get no                graces for lack of prayer?                      The  power  of  prayer  is  also  based  on  the  fact  that                through his divine merits, and his suffering and prayer of 34                                                                    '                years our Lord has already acquired and Obtained everything                we  ask  for  from  the  Father.  When  we  pray  with  good                dispositions,  we  are  praying  with  Jesus  and  in  Jesus,  and   117                Jesus  himself  prays  from  within  us  to  win  the  graces  we                need. Oh, how much we should thank the divine goodness                              '                for  having  given  us  prayer  and  for  having  annexed  so                powerful, a divine efficacy to it!                      How did the saints sanctify themselves? Through prayer.                How  did  they  happen  to  enrich  themselves  with  virtues,  to                prevail  over  the  world,  hell,  passions,  and  become  like                celestial  beings?  How  did  they  happen  to  be  totally                transformed in Jesus Christ becoming one with him? Through                prayer; through a continuous miracle of prayer.                      By considering the prayer of the saints we realize that it                was no languid, submissive, dormant, scarce, and without the                due dispositions as it unluckily happens to the","Religious  who  are  little  concerned  both  with  their  sancti-                fication  and  with  the  glory  of  Gad  and  the  good  of  their                neighbor.  Their  prayer  was  associated  with  the  due  dis-                positions of the effective prayer.                  b) Means to make the prayer effective                      We are dealing with the prayer's efficacy regarding the                Religious who are bound in duty to long for sanctification, to                grow  in  it,  to  want  the  glory  of  God  and  the  good  of  souls                through  the  perfect  unfolding  of  the  institute's  mission,  to                which they are committed. We are talking to you, Daughters                of  Divine  Zeal,  whose  name  Divine  Zeal  engages  and                compels you to seek with all effort the glory of God, your own                sanctification,  the  sanctification  of  others,  and  the  present                and the future souls as well.                      Which  are  the  dispositions  and  the  conditions  required                so  that  your  prayer  obtains  anything  you  ask  of  Jesus  for                yourselves and for others?                                118                      1.  Cooperation.  Continuous  cooperation  to  attain  what                you  are  asking  for  represents  the  first  disposition.  For                instance,  suppose  you  are  asking  the  Lord  to  make  you                perfect  in  holy  obedience.  Well,  you  must  do  your  best  to                obey perfectly. Through prayer you receive grace, but grace                needs  your  cooperation,  which  is  your  work.  While                cooperation  makes  grace  fruitful,  on  the  other  hand  grace                increases the help and strength you need for praying. Prayer                and cooperation increase each other. So that a person may                achieve  what  she  is  asking  for,  she  must  be  steady  and                perseverant in this double practice of prayer and cooperation,                building up the good will that brings prayer and cooperation                into  action,  since  good  will  is  the  source  of  any  good,                whereas bad will is the source of any evil.                          Daughters of Divine Zeal, the development of your","good will depends solely on you; while doing so, ask of the                Lord  the  best  graces  for  his  glory,  for  you,  for  all,  and  for                everything;  cooperate  with  holy  force  in  order  to  achieve                what  you  are  asking;  if  you  bring  into  action  the  required                conditions, you will obtain every-thing.                       2.   Meditation. That the prayer's efficacy depends on                meditation is a truth to be taken into serious consideration.                Meditation  makes  a  person  understand  the  necessity  of                grace and compels her to ask for it; it makes one understand                how  much  God  deserves  worship  and  love,  urging  the                person  to  stay  in  the  divine  presence  in  order  to  implore                love,  forgiveness,  and  graces;  it  makes  the  person                understand  her  own  nothingness  and  human  failings,                drawing her to implore mercy and salvation. The meditation                on  Jesus  Christ's  mysteries  inflames  the  soul  with  holy                wishes of seeking, loving, pleasing, and owing Jesus.                      3.   Longing.  To  be  effective,  the  prayer  and  the   119                cooperation must be combined by desire. Desire gives wings                to the will, which makes it fly toward the object of its longing.                Because  of  that,  the  prayer  full  of  holy  wishes  and  proper                dispositions is very effective.                      The more we know and feel ourselves in need of some                good, the more we desire it; the more intense is the desire,                the more the soul prays and cooperates to satisfy it. We say,                pray and cooperate, because our prayer must be combined                with our cooperation if we really want to achieve what we are                asking for.                      Prayer  having  imperfect  or  no  cooperation  implies                imperfect wishes as we realize from the following saying of                the  Holy  Spirit:  «  The  idler's  desires  are  the  death  of  him,                since his hands will do no work » (Prov. 21, 25). Therefore,                prayer, meditation, cooperation, and striving","to form ardent desires to achieve the great, eternal goods is                our duty.                      4. Fervor. Ardent desires form the fervent prayer. Happy                is the soul that prays with great; intense fervor reaching God,                Jesus, his love, and his union of love! When prayer combines                the dispositions we have mentioned above with the ones we                are about to speak of, it pierces heaven and moves the Heart                of Jesus, winning any grace. We should ask for this spirit of                fervent, effective prayer, which the Lord does not deny to the                simple, humble souls that meditate on how to love, serve, and                glorify him.                      The Apostle St. Paul wrote: « In the same way the Spirit                also comes to help us, weak as we are. For we do oat know                haw we ought to pray; the Spirit himself pleads with God for                us, in groans that words cannot express» (Rom. 8, 26). This                prayer  combined  with  tears  and  sighs  is  the,  prayer  that                formed  saints,  obtained  resources  and  salvation  to  the                Church, the sinners' conversion, God's glory, and the souls'                good,  because  such  a  prayer  continues  the  prayers  of  our   120                Lord Jesus Christ.                      For  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests  we  recom-                mend this spirit of prayer to the Daughters of Divine Zeal, in                compliance with the name they bear, as well as with the vow                of  obedience  to  the  divine  command:  «Pray,  therefore!  »,                which  urges  them  to  ardently  protect  the  interests  of  that                divine Heart. This fervid prayer is the celestial, vivifying rain                that  waters  the  holy  Church's  fields,  making  spiritual                vegetation appears in a barren soil.                      If this spirit of prayer will be as constant as perseverant,                the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal's  institute  will  be  not  only                durable  and  deep-seated,  but  will  also  improve  for  God's                glory, sanctification, good of souls, and holy prosperity.","5.      Humility. God opposes the proud, but gives                the grace to the humble. So that our prayers may reach the                presence of God and be welcomed by Him, they need to be                born  of  a  humble,  contrite  heart.  The  prayer  of  a  sister,                indifferent to being humble, who is attached to her own self-                esteem,  whose  secret  pride  repels  the  admonitions  and                warnings  of  the  superior,  who  nurtures  grudges,  and                restrains  from  humiliating  herself  for  her  faults  or  from                acknowledging  them;  the  prayer  of  a  sister disregarding  to                overcome her secret pride, who is rude to her sisters, quick                to anger (pride is mother of it), and hardly obeys; the prayer                of a sister who considers herself better than the others, who                does  not  strive  to  be  humble,  who  perhaps  is  not  even                humble  in  the  sacrament  of  penance;  the  prayer  of  this                sister,  who  is  a  Religious  by  name  only  because  she  is                proud and rejected by the Lord; the prayer of such a sister                does  not  move  the  Heart  of  Jesus;  perhaps  it  rouses  his                indignation.                      Oh! I wish no Daughter of Divine Zeal be so indisposed,                full of the spirit of the pride's father, who is the devil; I wish   121                instead that they be Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart of                Jesus,  the  divine  teacher  who  said:  «  Learn  from  me,                because I am gentle and humble in spirit » (Mt. 11, 29); if the                sisters  want  their  prayers  to  be  welcomed  and  granted  by                the Lord, they must be humble.                      When a Religious is praying in the divine presence, she                must  be  fully  aware  of  her  indignity,  being  as  a  guilty,                miserable  person  who  is  imploring  mercy.  She  should                annihilate herself in her heart, considering by faith that she is                residing the presence of the infinite majesty of Jesus Christ                who  is  our  Lord  and  God,  in  whose  presence  heaven  and                earth  yield  and  the  angelical  Powers  shudder.  She  has  to                combine deep humility of heart with","a humble attitude of the whole person. While praying let us                join  ourselves  to  the  humility  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who                threw  himself  face  down  while  praying!  Let  us  join  the                unequaled humility of the most holy Virgin Mary, who prayed                lying  dawn  full  length.  Owing  to  our  many  failing  and debts                toward  divine  justice,  where  should  we  sink  while  praying?                That the merciful eyes of the eternal charitable God look on                us, so that he mercifully bend forward to hear our prayers, we                need  to  humiliate  ourselves  interiorly  and  exteriorly  in  the                presence  of  his  divine  majesty,  imploring  mercy  for  us  and                the people.                      Happy is the person who brings a treasure of humility in                her prayer in the divine presence! How many graces she will                obtain for herself and others!                      6. Trust. Since trust originates from humility, like humility                it is an essential element of prayer. A proud person does not                believe she will obtain anything by praying. But, what is trust                all about? It is a gentle union with Jesus making us see him                as  our  loving,  benign,  gentle,  supreme  goodness,  who  is   122                longing to communicate his graces, and to make us see him                as our father, friend, brother, spouse, and tender lover. This                loving trust which remains constant despite contrary reasons,                drives the humble, loving soul to hug the knees of the loving                God and to look at him with eyes imploring mercy, even when                Jesus  seems  unwilling  to  grant  graces  for  just  reasons;  it                makes the soul follow God when he seems far away, crying                like the blind in the Jerico's street: « Jesus, my Jesus, hear                my request; I will cry till you hear me for your mercy, for your                divine meek heart, and for your glory! »                      Oh! What a fervent, loving, humble, sweet, tender wards                a person will say to Jesus when she is full of holy trust; and                how pleased Jesus is by such a humble prayer","full of trust. Such a soul may draw any grace from his divine                hands!  We  find  such  a  humble,  confiding  prayer  in  the                Canaanite woman's mouth, which we must keep in mind (Mt.                15, 21-28).                       We  must  also  remember  that  such  humility  and  trust                cannot  dwell  in  a  soul  nurturing  malice,  lacking  sincerity,                concealing some failings from the confessor, and having no                filial trust in the superior. Such a great treasure of humility                and  trust  in  Jesus,  our  supreme  goodness,  is  a  gift  of  the                soul  loving  simplicity,  hating  lies,  striving  to  grow  in  divine                love  and  holy  perfection,  praying,  and  being  fond  of                mortification; a soul of pure intention seeking only God and                her perfection in God and through God along with everything                which  concerns  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests.                When a person strives fully, with humble, confident prayer,                the Lord will fortify her with his grace.                      7.  Perseverance.  In  speaking  about  necessity  and                efficacy  of  prayer,  we  touched  on  perseverance,  which   123                means praying all one's life long.                      Prayer  is  the  breath  of  the  soul.  We  breathe  con-                tinuously,  and  breath  keeps  us  alive.  Breath  and  life  end                together, so we must pray continuously if we are to maintain                the spirituality of the soul alive. Prayer, however, cannot be                always automatic as breath is; to remedy it, we must have a                mind to always pray while performing our occupations, even                in  the  night  while  sleeping.  Perseverance  in  prayer  also                implies repeating the prayers all our life.                      Our Lord Jesus Christ set the example of perseverance                in  prayer.  Beginning  from  the  incarnation  up  to  his  last                breath  on  the  cross,  he  prayed  constantly.  «  Jesus  again                gave  a  loud  cry,  and  breathed  his  last  »  (Mt.  27,  50). The                divine Heart included all of his wishes in that","cry, the longings for his Father's glory, our salvation, and his                divine prayers.                      We  read  in  the  gospel:  «  Then  Jesus  told  them  this                parable,  to  teach  them  that  they  should  always  pray  and                never became discouraged » (Lk. 18, 1). We have said that                even the same prayers must be repeated until the end of our                life, imitating Jesus who repeated his prayer: « Again Jesus                left  them,  went  away,  and prayed  the  third  time,  saying  the                same words » (Mt. 26, 44).                      The  holy  Church  orders  the  priests  to  say  the  divine                office  every  day,  repeating  the  psalms  of  the  holy  prophet                David. While saying novenas or a special course of prayers in                order to obtain graces, we have to say them uninterruptedly,                and observing the same schedule. While hoping for a special                grace  for  the  Lord's  glory  or  for  our  sanctification  or  for  the                good of souls or the like, we must persevere in prayer always                seeking the fulfillment of the compassionate Heart of Jesus'                merciful will.                                                                          124                     We must keep in mind the divine teaching of the gospel                in the parables of the friend who knocks at another friend's                door  in  the  night  asking  for  three  loaves,  also  that  of  the                widow  troubling  an  unjust  judge  in  order  to  obtain  justice.                Despite the denials, both the friend and the widow received                what they were asking for, because they were troublesome.                Perseverant prayer achieves the same results.                      One,  who  grows  feeble  in  the  spirit  of  perseverant                prayer, also grows feeble in the perseverance of doing good.                      8.  Attention.  While  praying,  the  soul  must  be  aware  of                the  divine  presence,  concentrating  an  the  prayers  she  is                addressing  to  the  Lord,  driving  away  any  distraction,  and                almost  meditating  on  each  ward,  even  those  of  the  Our                Father or the Hail Mary or the Glory.","c) What we should ask for in prayer                     The final aim of our prayers will be always God's glory,                our  sanctification,  and  the  good  of  souls  for  the  greatest                consolation of the most holy Heart of Jesus.                      1.  To give particulars, the Religious of this community                will  ask  that  God  be  known,  adored,  loved,  and  served  all                over the world. To reach this goal, the Religious will be fond                of the spirit of prayer aiming at winning good workers to the                holy Church, in obedience to the divine zeal of the heart of                Jesus'  command:  «  Pray,  therefore!...;  »  which  forms  the                object of our great mission.                       The aim of our prayers is the triumph of the holy Church                both  in  the  sanctification  of  its  members  and  in  the  holy                freedom, as well as the exaltation of the Holy See and the                sacred worship for God's glory.                      2.  For  the  sake  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  and  his   125                divine  love,  the  Religious  will  ask  with  ardent  desire  and                perfect  union  with  his  divine  will,  the  virtues  of  humility,                obedience,  meekness,  and  patience.  She  will  also  ask  for                charity toward all; benign charity, patient, fervent, industrious,                compassionate as well as the true, right, fervent zeal for the                most holy Heart of Jesus' interests. She will pray for wisdom,                acknowledgement of her own nothingness, and a knowledge                of the immense, infinite greatness of God and Jesus, who is                our supreme goodness. She will also pray to obtain the grace                of  meditating  deeply  on  the  life,  Passion,  death,  and  the                mysteries  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  infinite  love.  The  soul                who is eager for her sanctification will pray with great fervor to                know Jesus intimately, to love him ardently in the great Eu-                charistic  mystery,  to  adore  him  devoutly,  to  watch  with  him                lovingly before the holy tabernacles all over the","world. At last, she will petition Jesus in the Holy Sacrament                for  the  most  intimate  union  of  pure  love  through  the  daily                Eucharistic Communion; and far the grace to receive him in                her heart with finest disposition. (5)                      Remember,  a  soul,  that  to  make  perfect  these  holy                requests,  and  to  achieve  holy  perseverance  through  a  holy                death, you must implore it every day from the most holy Heart                of Jesus' charity and the most holy Virgin Mary, and through                the  intercession  of  the  angels,  and  the  saints.  So  that  the                prayer for holy perseverance may be fruitful, you will daily ask                the Lord for growth in holiness, in holy virtues, and in spiritual                goods.                      3. Now let us speak of the effect of our third request. We                should  ask  the  divine,  infinite  goodness  for  the  good  of                everyone. Since charity requires of us to love our neighbor as                ourselves and to desire for each person what we desire for                ourselves, we should ask the Lord for the sanctification and                the eternal salvation of all.                                                                          126                     a. Over and above what the divine Rogate commands of                us,  we  must  pray  particularly  far  the  conversion  of  sinners                with such earnestness as to draw our tears, especially when                the  matter  is the misled  clergy  or  the  Religious.  We  should                ask for divine mercy, and for conversion to its love and to the                perfect fulfillment of their duties. It is also our duty to pray for                those in power that they may behave in a holy Christian spirit                for the good of their subjects. In response to the saying of the                Holy  Spirit  in  the  Eccl.:  «  Do  not  be  late  in  praying  and                helping those who are being drawn into the abyss, » we will                pray with solicitous, holy care for the dying, especially those                who are running the risk of dying in disgrace. While praying                with  great  tenderness  of  heart  for  all  children,  we  will                remember those who are not baptized so","that they may receive the sacrament of baptism, as well as                for those who are baptized, that they may grow innocent and                free from the world and the devil's snare since their tender                age, and live in an environment of good education to achieve                 good results. (6)                      That the kingdom of Jesus Christ on earth may rise and                spread widely on the ruins of the devil's, we must pray for                the destruction of the kingdom of Satan, for the destruction                of the devil press, for the overthrow and the annihilation of                secret  societies  or  hellish  diabolic  sects,  especially  the                excommunicated  freemasonry,  for  the  complete  defeat  of                socialism's subversive principles all over the world and of the                diabolic  Bolshevism's,  which  originated  from  the  unhappy                Russia!                      b.   The love of Jesus Christ urges us to pray for our                neighbor's  temporal  good  when  it  is  subordinate  to  the                spiritual benefit. Let us pray, therefore, for the vexed people                so that they may be consoled by God; for those in jeopardy,   127                to  be  saved;  for  the  abandoned,  to  be  helped  in  their                tremendous suffering; for the sick, to be healed or attended                or  relieved  and  comforted,  for  the  prisoners,  to  be  freed  if                they  are  not  guilty,  and  not  to  be  oppressed  or  abused                 immoderately, if they are guilty. (7)                     c.   Each  Religious  will  pray  fervently  for  the  spiritual                and  temporal  well-being  of  the  superiors,  the  superior                general, the masters, the fellow-members, our houses, and                the  school-board,  the  students,  as  well  as  for  the  divine                providence in our houses, the soundness of the fellows, the                education, the arts and crafts, and the preservation from evil,                relating  everything  to  our  spiritual  well-being,  to  God  and                Jesus  Christ's  divine  will.  To  expand  our  intentions  to                everything and everywhere, we must combine our intentions                and prayers with the intentions","and prayers of our Lord Jesus Christ in his mortal life and in                the Holy Sacrament, imploring spiritual and temporal graces.                      4.  Thanksgiving.  It  is  our  duty  to  give  thanks  while                praying.                      Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  please  do  not  neglect  this                highest  duty,  not  only  because  it  is  a  great  means  to  win                more graces and mercies, but all the more because the great                donor of all goods deserves the greatest, universal tribute of                gratitude from each creature. Gratitude shall be a prominent                virtue  of  this  least  institute,  which  is  consecrated  to  the                sweetest  Heart  of  Jesus!  Following  the  exhortation  of  St.                Paul: « In all your prayers ask God for what you need, always                asking  him  with a  thankful heart»  (Phil.  4, 6),  we  will  never                cease  giving  thanks  to  the  Lord.  This  way,  the  universal                prayer will become the fountain of many mercies for us, for                the holy Church, and for the whole world.                 d) When and were we should pray                           128                      We must pray always, in any place and any time.                     It  is  written:  «  They  should  always  pray  and  never                become discouraged » (Lk. 18, 1); « nothing hinder thee from                praying  »  (Eccl.  18,  22);  therefore,  by  forming  a  habitual                intention to pray and give thanks in any moment, we have to                lift  up  our  mind  to  God  before  any  action  and  service,                redressing  human  failings,  which  do  not allow  a  continuous                elevation of the mind in prayer. In his infinite goodness, our                Lord accepts any laving intention of carrying out what human                failings or other circumstances do not allow us to.                      Can  we  pray  while  working?  St.  John  Climacus  wants                the  people not  to attend  to  anything else  while  praying, but                his opinion concerns the graver of obligation. (8)","The prayer in common is to be vocal, and each one must                say it because exempting oneself from it would be a serious                default and the beginning of lukewarmness. We must hold in                great  esteem  prayer  in  private  and  in  common;  the  private                prayer, either allowed by obedience or required by a specific                devotion, is of great profit to the person who knows how to                deal  with  God  tête  à  tête,  in  the  solitude  of  her  heart;  the                prayer  in  common  wins  the  graces  from  the  Lord  easily,                because  God  cannot  help  granting  graces  to  the  prayer  in                common, on condition that the people pray with fervor, faith,                and pure intention — says St. John Chrysostom.                      Any time is good for prayer, but special times are more                suitable to win graces, because they are more acceptable to                God  as,  for  instance,  the  time during  the  celebration  of the                holy mass; then heaven unfolds to pour out graces on earth                since  our  prayers  join  our Lord  Jesus  Christ's  prayers,  who                immolates himself on the altar as victim of atonement for our                sins,  reconciling  us  to  God.  Another  acceptable  time  for                prayer is that of Holy Communion, when Jesus is in our heart                through the host. Isn't it the time to make true the following   129                words of the apostle: « He gave us his Son — will he not also                freely give us all things » (Rom. 8, 32)?                      The liturgical feasts are also acceptable times for prayer.                Just as the kings of this world are more favorably disposed to                grant favors on their saint's day or on the anniversary of their                coronation and victories, so the adorable Lord Jesus Christ is                more disposed to  hear  us  in  the  days  set  to  commemorate                the mysteries and the triumphs of  his divine love for human                beings; the same happens to the most holy Virgin Mary, the                angels, and the saints on the days of their feasts.                      Hence, we shall profit by these solemnities by appealing","humbly  and  confidently  with  petitions  and  prayers  in                order to obtain what we need; these favorable opportunities                cannot be missed. (9)                 e) To wham must we pray?                      1. We must pray to God, one and triune, the most holy                Trinity, from whom any good proceeds.                     We pray to the eternal Father through the merits of his                Son, our Lord.                     We  pray  to  Jesus,  our  supreme  goodness,  in  the                practices of piety, devotions, holy masses, Communions, and                always. (10)                     We  pray  to  the  adorable  third  person  of  the  most  holy                Trinity,  the,  holy  and  divine  Paraclete,  on  whom  any                sanctification  depends.  We  must  pray  to  him  fervently,                especially in his novena and feast, asking for his seven gifts                as  well  as  for  the  achievement  of  the  12  fruits.  When  a                person receives the gifts of the Holy Spirit, she becomes holy                and perfect:                                              130                      2. After the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we pray                to the mast holy Virgin Mary, because Jesus tied his graces                to the powerful, loving intercession of his and our most holy                mother Mary. (11)                      3.  Let  us  also  pray  to  St.  Joseph,  Immaculate  Mary's                most holy spouse, the Son of God's putative father, the Holy                Family's  head,  the  universal  patron  of  the  holy  Church,  the                special protector of the people of any class and condition, the                greatest among the saints, powerful in heaven and distributor                of the divine graces.                      4.  Let  us  also  pray  to  the  powerful  St.  Michael  the                archangel,  head  of  the  celestial  army,  most  zealous  for  the                divine honor, conqueror of Lucifer, leader and guardian of the                holy Church, assistant master of the good","death, protector and visitor of the holy souls of purgatory.                      5.   Let us pray to St. Gabriel the archangel, the mes-                senger  of  the  good  news,  a  special  guardian  angel  of  the                most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  fortress  of  God,  and  courage  of  the                shy; to St. Raphael the archangel, medicine of God, sure and                faithful  guide  in  the  life  pilgrimage;  to  our  dearest  guardian                angels,  who  are  our  faithful  friends,  guide,  help,  light,  and                comfort  since  our birth;  to our  beloved  saints,  whose  name                we bear since our baptism; to the patron saints we draw by                lots  every  year  in  a  spiritual  industry  of  ours;  to  the  saints                whose  lives  edify  us,  and  especially  to  the  Celestial                Rogationists of Jesus' Heart.                      6.   In  a  special  manner  let  us  pray  to  the  powerful,                great  benefactor,  wonder-worker, and  saint of  all  the  world,                St. Anthony of Padua, also appealing to the patron saints of                the cities where we have communities as well as to the saints                who won graces for us. Our thanksgiving will always join our   131                prayers  to  God,  the  most  holy  Virgin,  the  angels,  and  the                saints. (12)                  f) Various formulas of prayer                     The best prayer our Lord Jesus Christ taught us is the                Our  Father.  Several  devotional  books  can  help  us  both  to                understand  the  various  interpretations  and  to  keep  them  in                mind while praying, being fully aware of its divine words and                petitions.                      Next to Our Father is the Hail Mary. The second part of it                is  as  important  as  effective.  The  rosary,  taught  by  the  holy                Virgin is also an excellent prayer, because the saying of the                Our Fathers and Hail Marys is combined with the meditation                on the mysteries of the life, Passion, death, and resurrection                of our Lord Jesus Christ, and","on the mysteries of the most holy Virgin. Our communities will                say it every day. The litany of the most holy Virgin is another                celestial prayer that follows the rosary.                      Prayer  books  written  by  the  saints  as  well  as  the  «                Filotee  »,  like  the  one  by  Riva  in  vigor  in  our  communities,                contain plenty of beautiful prayers. We must be very fond of                our  prayer  book  because  it  contains  specific  prayers  which                are related to our houses and to the birth and progress of our                institutions. The after-mass prayers may be said in private or                in common.                      Divine are the prayers of the Holy Scripture, especially                the holy prophet David's psalms; in the private recitation they                may be said in the Latin or the Italian version. Even though                the Italian version is more understood, the Latin is preferable;                in  the  recitation  in  common,  however,  the  Latin  version  is                binding.                      Inspired are also the various prayers of the Church such                as the Oremus, which mean « let us pray » (we may also use   132                them in private devotion), as well as the majestic Litany of the                Saints,  which  we  say  in  our  communities  in  particular                circumstances.                 g) The heart's prayer                      The  most  effective  prayer  is  the  one  coming  from  the                heart. The person who is skilled in mental prayer, meditation,                and mortification; the, person feeling the love of Jesus along                with his Heart's interests; the person zealous for knowing and                loving  Jesus,  feeling  compassion  and  ardent  zeal  for  souls;                this person who is dedicated to virtue and sacrifice, needs no                formulas of prayer, because the Spirit, dwelling in her, makes                her  groan  inexpressibly.  To  obtain  divine  graces  for  divine                glory and salvation of all, she will pray with lively ardor and                will annihilate herself before God and Jesus' divine presence,                kissing his","adorable feet and looking at the supreme goodness with most                tender  trust.  Beautiful,  wise,  loving,  convincing  words  will                come from her heart longing for the Heart of Jesus' interests,                winning the graces, which the world does not deserve. Tears                will well up to the eyes, and sighs from the heart, as from a                fountain. To better touch the Heart of her divine spouse and                win  graces  for  God's  glory  and  salvation  of  souls,  which                would  seem  almost  impossible  to  obtain,  this  person  will                combine  her  ardent  prayers  with  her  effusive  and  diffusive                thanksgiving  for  the  graces  that  the  Lord  has  granted,  is                granting, and will grant to everyone. Kneeling down with the                hands  raised  to  the  sky  or  to  the  crucifix  or  to  the  holy                tabernacle,  she  will  be  as  the  priest,  between  the  vestibule                and the altar, moistening the ground with tears, if necessary.                      Her prayer will become one with our Lord Jesus Christ's                divine prayer; the wails of her soul will be the wails of Jesus                in the solitude, in the caves, on the mountains; her sighs will                be the sighs and the prayers of Jesus suffering in his Passion                from  the  garden  to  the  cross,  up  to  the  loud  cry  when  he                breathed his last; her prayers will be the divine petitions that   133                God,  the  eternal  pontiff  hidden  in  the  Holy  Sacrament,                repeats for us until the end of time.                      When  this  person  who  is  united  with  Jesus  through                meditation and the sacrifice of herself is obliged by obedience                or common life to interrupt her prayer, with all her heart she                will make her time and actions an actual or habitual prayer;                the  night  will  be  also  a  suitable  time  for  her  to  pray  more                ardently and passionately in union with Jesus, and even while                sleeping  she  will  pray  in  union  with  Jesus,  at  least                intentionally and by protestation and desire.                      No one but God knows the graces this person wins","from the adorable Heart of Jesus, in favor of the holy Church,                the  pilgrim  souls,  the  souls  who  are  in  purgatory,  and  the                whole  world.  No  one  but  God  knows  how much  her  prayer                pleases the most holy Heart of Jesus. It was to this praying                person that the Holy Spirit spoke in the words of the celestial                spouse: « The flowers appear on the earth... the cooing of the                turtledove  is  heard  in  our  land...  Come  then,  my  love,  my                lovely one, come. My dove, hiding in the clefts of the rock, in                the coverts of the cleft of the rack let me hear your voice; for                your voice is sweet » (Songs 2, 12-14). The voices coming                from the heart, longing for my glory and for goodness of souls                are utterances of paradise.                      Even  when  this  person  forgets  herself  in  the  prayer  to                the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests,  she  will  leave  her                prayer in a holier state than before, sharing the good she has                obtained for souls, the divine glory she has caused, and the                celestial  consolations  she  has  given  the  beloved  Heart  of                Jesus.  I  wish  such  souls  were  in  all  communities  that  are                consecrated to Jesus!                                                                          134                h) Exhortation                      Our padre talks to his daughters in Jesus Christ:                     You along with the future Daughters of Divine Zeal must                know and keep in mind that this Pious Institute of the Heart of                Jesus' interests, along with the two religious communities, the                orphanages  and  the  institutions  originated,  improved,  and                was formed through prayer; especially through the prayer and                the yearly petition we presented to the eternal Father in the                most holy name of Jesus in January, believing our Lord Jesus                Christ's divine, ineffable promises. Through such petitions we                asked  the  divine,  infinite  goodness  for  special  graces  of                sanctification and formation in the Lord for this pious institute;","we asked the kingdom of God along with its justice, basing                our faith on our Lord Jesus Christ's merits of infinite value, on                his divine word, and also on the most holy Virgin, the angels,                and the saints' powerful intercession.                      We point out that the prayers we have made in any time                and  circumstances,  especially  during  the  mass,  the  feasts,                and  embarrassing  situations  were  accompanied  by  the                conditions we have talked about in this detailed chapter. At                the  same  time,  we  have  endeavored  to  combine  the  works                with prayer, avoiding even the least venial sin by deliberate                assent; we have done our best to help our neighbor spiritually                and  corporally  for  God's  sake  only,  always  imploring  good                workers  for  the  holy  Church  in  compliance  with  our  special                mission, besides practicing various spiritual industries` Thus,                divine  mercy  bent  down  toward  this  small  grain,  blessed  it,                looked favorably at the poor of his divine Heart and said: «                Grow and multiply!                      The  community  is  bound  in  duty  to  keep  in  mind  such   135                things, knowing that when the unvarnished faith in the prayer,                in the yearly petition, in the spiritual industries grows feeble                — God forbid! — when the vision of the pure, right intention                grows dim — God forbid! — when the spiritual industries are                neglected  —  God  forbid!  —  when  even  the least  deliberate                defect  does  not  matter,  then  the  door  is  open  to  the  devil,                who will come in to ravage the sheepfold! Disgusted, God will                withdraw  his  grace,  will  stop  looking  favorably  at  this  pious                institute,  to  which  he  has  been  so  loving  and  has  given  so                many  benefits,  holding  it  as  his  own  no  longer;  on  the                contrary, he will become indignant at it, because the more he                benefits and cherishes an institute or a community, the more                he becomes indignant at it when it becomes unfaithful! Then,                everything Will go to ruin: what has been built for so","long,  even  for  centuries,  will  fall  down  decaying  in  a  short                while, as unluckily happened to so many institutes once holy                and blooming in the holy Church.                      The  superiors,  above  all,  will  pay  careful  attention  to                avoid slackening in the communities by maintaining observ-                ance  along  with  the  exercise  of  holy  virtues,  by  strongly                opposing  the  least  deliberate  defect,  and  by  dismissing  the                people who offer no hope; they will be also watchful in order                to prevent false vocations from entering the community. Let                us  pray  that  the  Lord  give  us  the  people  of  true  vocation,                whose hearts are with Jesus, whose thoughts are turned to                Jesus,  and  whose  minds  understand  the  Heart  of  Jesus'                interests, their own sanctification, and the salvation of others                as well (S.D.D.Z.)!                               9. TO JESUS THROUGH MARY                      a) The secret of holiness                                                                          136                     The additional great love that must burst into flames in                your heart is for the great mother of God. Dearest daughters,                you  know  well  that  you  cannot  love  Jesus  without  loving                Mary, that you can go to Jesus through Mary only, and that                Immaculate  Mary  has  been  ,proclaimed  superior,  owner,                mother  and  master  of  this  institute;  therefore,  love  and                devotion  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  should  be  a  peculiar                characteristic of this order (Speech, St. Joseph, 1908).                      You  wrote  to  me  about  our  sweetest  mother,  owner,                master, and superior's entrance in this lucky community, (13)                making  my  cool  heart's  flint  spring  a  few  tears!  May  your                Immaculate  Mother  in  Sorrow,  and  superior  bless  you                daughters,  disciples,  and  subjects  filling  you  with  her  most                elect graces in order to make you always grow more in the                holy fervor of love and service for","the  consolation  of  the  Celestial  Queen  of  Hearts.  By  loving                and  serving  this  great  mother  we  can  know,  love,  and                possess  through  charity  the  supreme  good, our  Lord  Jesus                Christ, who must be our last and supreme goal. The people                who seek Mary, find Jesus; those who do not seek her, do                not  find  him.  She  is  the  door  leading  the  beginners  in  the                spiritual  life  to  Jesus,  and  makes  the  proficient  ones  enter                Jesus' nuptial hall and the wine-cellar which enraptures them                with  divine  love.  By  loving  the  most  holy  Virgin  with  great                transport you will grow in virtues belonging totally to our Lord                Jesus Christ.                      Love  for  the  most  holy  Virgin  mainly  consists  in  the                imitation of her virtues, especially humility, purity, strong and                constant love for our Lord, zeal for his glory and salvation of                souls  as  well  as  great  charity  and  meekness  in  all                encounters.                      During my trip (14) I have experienced a great treasure                of devotion to the most holy Virgin, a secret of sanctification,                which opens a new horizon on the luck of belonging to the   137                most  holy  Mary,  helping  find  Jesus  through  her.  This                particular devotion was outlined by a great servant of God,                who was beatified some years ago. The devotion I bring to                you with the Lord's help is like a priceless treasure from far                off  that  will  fill  the  proclamation  of  immaculate  Mary  as                mother, owner, master, and absolute superior; it is like the                answer of the most holy Virgin to our proclamation, and I am                glad to announce it in reply to your touching statement about                our sweetest mother and lady's lovely entrance.                      Everything you had arranged for the hearty reception of                our sweetest mother was wonderful, inspired, and pleasant                to  her  and  her  divine  son,  Jesus,  our  goodness.  I  did  not                deserve being there, so I went on unaware of it. On Saturday                19, however, I went to the feet of our","Rapid Hearer in the cathedral to sing her praise, but I had no                image of Our Lady of the Letter. After finding one in a book, I                exposed it all day long. This way, the most holy Virgin called                me back to Messina.                      Through the doctrine of that blessed servant of God I am                going to make you belong totally to the most holy Virgin and                to Jesus through her. (15)                      Now I bless you all, but in a special way I bless the one                who must impersonate the most holy Virgin's superiority and                holiness. I hope to see you all strengthened and blooming in                the  spirit  of  religious  observance,  in  the  exercise  of  holy                virtues,  in  the  zeal  for  your  own  sanctification,  and  in  the                fervent  prayer  to  win  numerous,  holy  workers  to  the  holy                Church.                                                  Sincerely,                                         Your servant in Jesus Christ,                                      Padre Mary Hannibal Di Francia.                                                                          138                b) Slavery of lave                      To redeem human beings, who where slaves of Lucifer,                Jesus  Christ  took  the  nature  of  a  servant,  making  himself                subject to the Father and the most holy Mary.                      The most holy Mary was the creature most obedient to                God, being perfectly conformed to His will. Saying, however,                that she was a servant because she said « I am the Lord's                servant, » is the slightest thing we can say since God would                have never accepted Mary's servitude if such servitude were                not servitude of love. It follows that we must make ourselves                servants of Jesus for love.                      This  servitude  starts  with  the  baptism  that  changes  us                from servants of sin into servants of Jesus Christ. We must                be  fully  aware  of  this  truth  cooperating  with  our  will  and                making ourselves conscious servants of our","Lord Jesus Christ. We, however, are unable to do so without                being servants of the most holy Mary out of love. This is the                secret!  This  was  the  revelation  the  Holy  Spirit  made  to  St.                Louis M. Grignion (Speech, Oct. 25, 1908).                      Let  us  consider  how  great  is  the  privilege  of  being                servants  of  the  most  holy  Virgin.  The  aim  of  this  sacred                servitude  is.  to  become  perfect  servants  of  our  Lord  Jesus                through the most holy Mary, confessing him as our Lord and                God,  serving  him  with  faithfulness,  and  doing  his  adorable                will.  Oh,  what  a  glorious  servitude!  Through  it  we  belong                totally to Jesus and Mary, who unite us to their divine Hearts                by making us share their graces!                      This  sacred  servitude  of  perfect  love makes  us  perfect                children  of  Jesus  and  Mary  by  freeing  us  from  the  devil's                snares, by improving our knowledge and love for Jesus and                Mary,  by  granting  us  many  blessings  during  our  life  and                death, and by making us happy for ever, if we are faithful and                persevering.                                                                          139                     To reach this great glory, we have to prepare our-selves                by prayer imploring enlightenment and grace from the most                holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary as well as from the Holy Spirit;                we  have  to  acknowledge  our  nothingness  as  well  as  to                renounce the world, sin, the devil, and our passions in order                to improve our knowledge and love for our Lord Jesus Christ                and the most holy Virgin, our sweetest mother and lady (From                the « Way of Preparation to the Sacred Servitude »).                  c) The Sacred Servitude's chief points                                               Rome, May 13, 1906 (16)                         The Marian Servitude's chief points as I understand                and apply them to myself are the following:","1. I do not belong to myself any longer, but to Mary. My                body  and  its  physical,  social  rights,  senses,  faculties,  ect.                belong to Mary, who may dispose of it at her will.                      2. The soul and its spiritual, intellectual faculties as well                as its powers, rights, etc. belong to Mary.                      3. The merits, graces, virtues, either past or present or                future,  that  I  may  have  or  practice  with  God's  omnipotent                help, belong to Mary.                      4.  What  I  possess  for  any  reason,  either  things  or                persons, as for instance the rights of the physical, civil, social,                moral life, etc. belong to Mary; just as a slave and his things                belong  to  an  absolute  owner  and  lady  who  purchased  or                received him as a slave gift, so my things belong to Mary.                      5.  Since  this  donation  and  servitude  are  going  to  be                eternal, so also the eternal glory that I hope to receive in a                Christian  spirit,  belongs  to  the  most  holy  Mary,  who  may                dispose  of  it,  making  other  creatures,  she  wants  to  save,   140                share  in  it  according  to  her  pleasure.  While  making  this                donation, I humbly request that my power to love God and the                most holy Mary for ever and beyond measure be not reduced                by my glory's renunciation.                      6. This perfect, complete servitude will be practiced by                means of the following:                      a. Meditation on the servitude of love and renovation of                it.                      b. To have a virtual or at least a habitual awareness of                the  servitude  in  order  to  receive  everything  in  any  moment                with humble gratitude from my owner's hands as her gift or                grace.                      c. In order to act or use the physical, intellectual,","moral, and spiritual life, I have to ask at least the virtual                permission of the most holy Virgin.                      d.  I  will  avoid  any  in  and  work  the  greatest  good,                because  a  servant  must  take  care  of  the  lady's  things,                behaving according to her will.                      e.  I  will  endure  any  cross,  suffering,  humiliation,                opposition,  etc.  as  serious,  lovely  punishments  from  the                celestial owner, who aims at my atoning and amending.                      f.  Basing  everything  on  my  filial  love  through  the                consideration  that  I  am  a  son,  who  out  of  love  wants  to                become a servant of the celestial queen; or that she adopts                the servant as a son, making me a son and a servant out of                love.                      7.   It is fitting that this servitude for becoming a perfect                servant  of  Jesus,  our  supreme  good,  bring  about  Jesus'   141                reign in me perfectly, through the most holy Mary.                      8.   If  until  now  I  have  sought  to  find  and  possess                Jesus without succeeding, it has been because I circled the                mystical city's walls without entering through the door: now is                the  time  to  enter  through  the  door  which  is  the  most  holy                Mary. Amen!                              10. DEVOTION TO ST. JOSEPH                       Since  this  least  congregation  is  placed  under  St.  Jo-                seph's  special  protection,  the  congregants  will  honor  and                love him as the Virgin Mary's spouse and the Son of God's                virgin  father.  They  will  take  the  habit  and  the  vows  on  the                 feast of their patron (C.R.). (7)                     As great means of sanctification and progress, the most                holy Virgin disposed that her holiest virgin spouse","St. Joseph be your particular protector and that the taking of                the garb and the vows be under his auspices every year. Haw                beautiful  and  powerful  is  the  great  Patriarch's  special                protection! He watched over, and saved this little seed, this                humble institute from so many stormy events which tossed it                about as if it were a little flower among the whirls of a violent                storm threatening it with death! He invited the people to come                here, formed vocations, provided both souls and bodies with                spiritual  and  material  means;  he  opened  a  new  epoch  of                providence and public progress for you and our orphanages                through St. Anthony of Padua's graces and miracles. To them                we are so very much obliged! The great Patriarch St. Joseph                will  be  your  model  of  interior  virtue,  of  love  for  Jesus  and                Mary,  and  of  any  most  elect  virtue  (Speech,  St.  Joseph,                1908).                            11. THE HOLY ANGELS' PROTECTION                      Honoring the holy angels will be always in vigor in this                order.  The  glorious  St.  Michael  the  archangel,  special   142                protector  and  defender  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation  of  the                Heart  of  Jesus  and  of  its  institutions,  will  be  honored  in  a                special  way.  Also  the  seven  angels  who  are  in  the  divine                presence will be honored through some daily homage. Equal                devotion will be attributed to the holy guardian angels through                a daily invocation and the yearly feast (C.R.). In His infinite                goodness God granted them to all people for their protection.                      The angels are celestial princes who contemplate God’s                face,  as  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  said  (Mt.  18,  10).  Wholly                spiritual and simple by nature, they are of a higher rank .than                we humans. But even though we are inclined to evil and born                in  wickedness,  the  angels  esteem  and  take  care  of  us  for                God's infinite charity.","If we happen to fall in grave sins, disfiguring the image                of  God  in  ourselves,  the  guardian  angel  will  never  stop                protecting, assisting, and inspiring us to good, because he is                a  most  faithful  friend.  Happy  are  they  who  hear  and                understand his calm and ardent inspirations in the midst of                stormy  passions.  In  the  opinion  of  the  sacred  authors,  the                guardian  angel  not  only  protects  and  leads  our  soul  to                eternal life, but also takes care of our body looking after our                spiritual and temporal life...                      The guardian angels keep us continuously under their                protection,  freeing  us  from  a  thousand  disasters,  mis-                fortunes,  accidents,  perils,  and  calamities  which  are  quite                unknown. Not even a loving mother has as much tender care                of her children as the holy angels have for each of us!                      We know our true friends when we are in trouble, when                worldly  friends  turn  their back,  more  than  often,  in  spite of                their friendly declarations. The holy guardian angels, instead,   143                are always faithful, and the more we are in trouble, the more                they take care of us.                      In public misfortunes or calamities all guardian an-gels,                by mutual consent with the angel or archangel or principality                or patron or guardian of the nation, or of the people who are                struck  by  divine  punishment,  lend  help  to  our  need.  By                evidence from the Holy Scripture and common opinion, each                nation  has  been  given  an  angel  of  the  principalities  as  a                guardian and defender. This is the meaning of the following                words:  «  When  the  Most  High  gave  the  nations  their                inheritance, when he divided the sons of men, he fixed their                bounds according to the numbers of the sons of God » (Deut.                32, 8). Origen wrote: « In the beginning earth was distributed                to the angels » (Homily, 35 in Lk.). In times of calamities, the                holy angels","show greater zeal and intercession before God in benefit of                the people as well as of each of us.                      When  God  got  angry  with  his  people  threatening  them                with extermination, Moses prayed and obtained mercy. When                God  is  going  to  punish  us,  our  guardian  angels  do  what                Moses did because they were assigned to the human beings                to  protect  them;  besides,  God  likes  being  deterred  from                punishing  humankind,  cooling  down  His  anger  because  of                human prayer and penance.                      How  many  times  the  holy  guardian  angels  pray  for  us,                begging mercy from God, who is about to punish us! This is                why Isaiah calls the angels ambassadors of peace (Is. 33, 7),                Origen, our spiritual doctor (Homily, II in Song), and St. John                Chrysostom, light of souls, supporters of bodies, defenders of                the goods, also adding that « we are supported and helped at                land  and  sea,  we  are  enlightened  and  consoled  in  our                tribulations as well as freed from sickness by the angels. »                      To  win  their  protection  in  time  of  public  or  private   144                calamity, we have to nurture a sincere devotion to these most                faithful  guardians,  purifying  our  soul  from  sin.  If  we  are  not                afraid of eternal death, how can we hope that the angel will                free  us  from  temporal  death?  .If  we  do  not  step  offending                God, we cannot pretend to be delivered from His punishment.                In fact, we read in the Scripture: Many men died because of                the sin (Rom. 5, 15). « By sin whole races are disgraced »                (Prov. 14, 34).                      It is written: « If a man fears the Lord, evil will not come                his way » (Eccl. 33, 1). «They (the angels) will support you in                case you hurt your foot against a stone; you will tread on lion                and adder, trample on savage lions and dragons » (Ps. 91,                12-13). These passages are speaking of the strength that the                holy guardian angels infuse","into the souls of the devout in order that they may overcome                the hellish enemy's temptations even by treading on the                proud Lucifer. The holy angels protect the devout who are in                the midst of epidemics, which destroy human lives in the                cities and wherever they run their course.                      That  so  many  priests  and  holy  virgins  who  attend  un-                tiringly  the  people  infected  or  stricken  with  cholera  are  not                affected,  is  due  to  the  dear  guardian  angels'  particular                protection. If God sometimes wants to crown these heroes of                charity with martyrdom, the guardian angels will double their                protection in the transfer of these souls to eternity, introducing                them to God.                      How much God protects those who fear and trust him is                shown  by  the  three  Hebrew  children  in  Babylon  when  they                were thrown in the burning furnace by Nebuchadnezzar's will.                Sent  by  God,  an  angel  untied  the  ropes,  drove  away  the                flames  from  the  furnace,  and,  shining  beautifully,  he  began                walking  together  with  the  three  children  unharmed  in  the                midst of the surrounding, burning walls; they praised, blessed   145                God, and invited all creatures to do the same.                      Everyone  knows  what  the  Angel  Raphael  did  for  the                young Tobias during his journey, when he accompanied him                and took him home sound and safe.  He led the way, was a                guide and comfort, delivered him from the fish that was about                to devour him, introduced him to the uncle, protected him and                brought  about  his  marriage  with  Sarah;  at  last  he  took  him                home rich and happy, and caused Tobias' father to recover                from blindness.                      Even though we were sinners and negligent in the past,                if we want to Win the holy guardian angels' protection in time                of epidemics, earthquakes, war, or any other public calamity,                we must begin purifying our conscience from all the obstacles                that oppose divine clemency and mercy","without  loosing  heart.  By  benignity  and  compassion,  God                declares in the sacred Scripture that he will come back to us                as soon as we go back to Him; humanly speaking, he even                forgets our sins when we repent with all our heart. Therefore,                let us approach the holy Eucharist; by so doing we attract the                angels of heaven around us, and we become dreadful to the                spirits of hell. While approaching the Sacrament, let us repeat                with fervor our resolves to sin no more, preferring to die in the                public calamity rather than to offend God. After doing so, we                will  cease  to  invoke  our  holy  angels'  protection  in  the                calamity, saying special prayers and urging others to do the                same with confident appeal.                      It is remarkable what the guardian angels do in order to                deliver  children  from  serious  perils!  Abandoned  to                themselves, children often run serious risks or falls, but the                guardian  angels  watch  over  them  keeping  them  sound  and                safe. In amazement the people exclaim: « It is obvious that                the guardian angels save children! » Well then, all of us are                children  before  our  guardian  angels,  if  we  purify  our                conscience  from  our  faults,  entrust  ourselves  to  them  with   146                holy simplicity, and invoke their help.                      From how many perils, unknown to us, we are delivered                by  the  holy  angel  of  God!  No  person  may  have  escaped                some risk without help of his guardian angel. Therefore, we                must  nurture  in  our  heart  devotion  to  the  holy  guardian                angels,  who  will  always  be  our  most  faithful  friends  in  our                quandaries  and  in  public  calamities.  Children  and  youths                must be especially devout because their guardian angels are                zealous  for  keeping  them  safe  from  the  perils  of  gin  and                eternal damnation.                      When the hour of death nears, happy is the person who                heartily nurtured the beneficial devotion to the holy guardian                angel! His angel will be beside him with loving","care as a tender mother, fighting against the hellish enemies                and providing him in time with the sacraments. When the soul                leaves the body, the guardian angel will introduce his devout                before the tribunal of Jesus Christ, just judge.                      The holy guardian angel's protection for the person who                loved and honored him on earth continues in purgatory. That                tremendous prison of fire and inexpressible torments is to be                feared  more  than  any  calamity  on  earth!  Well  then,  the                guardian  angels'  merciful  service  in  favor  of  their  charges                continues  in  purgatory.  By  inspiration,  they  urge  parents,                relatives, and friends to pray for those souls; they touch the                hearts,  pray,  offer  the  divine  masses  to  the Lord,  and  even                visit the holy souls in purgatory to comfort and console them.                What next? When the angel obtains the eternal freedom for                the soul entrusted to him, what a glorious day is that one!                      The  angel  goes  to  him,  and  says:  «  Your  time  of                expiation  is  over;  come  with  me  in  the  kingdom  of  glory!  »                What a joy when the angel of God introduces the devout to                his Creator and Redeemer in the eternal home! Over there,   147                the guardian angel will share his happiness with the creature                he  protected.  There  the  elect  will  bless  God  forever  for  the                guardian angel's creation and appointment, seeing in God the                inexpressible,  specific  relation  between  himself  and  his                guardian  angel!  This  joyous  contemplation  along  with  the                knowledge  of  the  mysteries  which  appear  always  new  and                delightful  will  never  end  (From:  Preservation  from  Divine                Punishments)!                            12. THE CELESTIAL ROGATIONISTS (18)                      I  think  that  you  have  received  and  performed  the                proclamation of the lovely, glorious St. Francis of Sales","as  celestial  Rogationist  after  explaining  the  ceremony  to                these children, inspiring them with fervor and lifting them up                to heaven on the strong wings of faith! I am mailing four more                proclamations reminding you that the ceremony is private. If                you  are  going  to  accomplish  it  before  the  mass  and  the                people are in the church, you can do it even in the choir.                      The  proclamation  papers  are  to  be  preserved  in  a                dossier, which must be glued or sewed after recording them                in a register so that they may be read in the refectory every                year  the  day  before  their  anniversary  in  order  to  offer  the                mass to the Celestial Rogationists.                      We  proclaim  Celestial  Rogationists  or  Daughters  of                Divine  Zeal  those  male  and  female  saints  we  honor,  love,                admire, and invoke, believing that they would like to become                Rogationists  or  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal.  By  this                proclamation  they  become  our  celestial  vocations!  In  the                course of time, the celestial vocations will increase.                      While  human  events  reduce  our  ranks  and  impede   148                vocations,  through  such  proclamation  we  are  becoming  an                army  or  a  community  so  numerous  to  outdo  whatever  else                before long! What a grace of the Lord! We will be a crowded                religion  in  the  midst  of  an  uncrowded  religion  on  condition                that holy, pure, and candid faith be of assistance to us, in the                simplicity of heart. Amen (Letter, Jan. 27, 1916).                       13. DEVOTION TO THE SOULS IN PURGATORY                      Praying for the holy souls who are in purgatory is to be a                preeminent devotion as well as a practice of piety; therefore                the  probationers  will  often  read  and  meditate  on  purgatory                concluding the prayer before any action with a requiem. They                will offer the mass and the Communion","to  the  holy  souls  in  purgatory  every  Monday;  in  November,                they will offer all the exercises of piety (P.R.P.). Before taking                the  vows,  they  will  make  the  pious  donation  (Heroic  Act  of                Charity) in favor of the souls in Purgatory (R.L.P.).                      Piety  for  the  dead  is  as  ancient  as  death  itself.  But                Christianity, which sanctifies everything, fostered piety for the                dead beyond measure making a point of remembering them,                owing to the fact that these souls need our help in order to                transfer  from  'purgatory  to paradise.  By  reason  of  that,  it  is                everyone's duty to remember them.                      Dreadful  is  the  soul's  transfer  from  earthly  life  into                purgatory.  Without  knowing  how,  the  soul  finds  itself  in  the                midst  of  the  burning  whirls  overturned  by  the  surrounding                flames that penetrate inside, making it burn like a flame. The                soul does not know how to get free from that inner fire; wails,                squeaks,  and  agonies  are  not  a  remedy  to  the  horrible                burning, while degrees and duration of pain are as various as                the defects it must expiate. Some souls suffer more, others                less; some are condemned to a day prison, others to a month   149                or a year or 20 years or 50 years or a century prison. Fire is                not the only pain, because pains are as varied as the faults.                For instance, if one offended God by gluttony, he is horribly                tormented by hunger and thirst; if by ambition, he is deeply                humiliated  and  plunged  by  stench  and  his  own  decaying                body... Thus, sin is atoned through various pains.                      Missing  God,  however,  is  the  most  bitter  pain  for  the                souls in purgatory. God! We do not know him in this world!                We  are  like  the  blind  by  birth  who  do  not  long  for  light,                because  they  do  not  know  it!  On  the  contrary,  the  souls  in                purgatory long for God with an intimate, inexpressible desire                because  they  saw  Him  when  they  were  introduced  at  his                presence; they saw his infinite beauty, the beauty enrapturing                for ever the myriads of","the elected; but the vision lasted an instant: on and off! And                yet, what deep impressions the vision of God left inside them!                All  flames  in  purgatory  are  not  enough  to  make  the  souls                divert their mind from that lovely attention. They think of God,                loving him, longing for him, being eager for him, and desiring                him: like doves that one taken into custody, they flutter their                wings over and over the subject of their longing, but in vain.                They cannot take off to God before satisfying His justice.                      Oh, what pain this is! How painful is this state for souls!                They are always on the paint of taking off to God, but they                cannot;  they  love  God,  but  do  not  see  His  face;  they  are                queens of paradise, but are taken into custody in purgatory;                exile is over, but they do not enter their homeland! At least,                could  they  lift  up  their  petitions  to  God  so  that  their  pains                might be shortened by prayers! I think of them as saying: «                Lord, we have sinned; we have been negligent in our duties                not  worrying  about  our  daily  defects;  little  thefts,  frequent                rumblings,  and  being  absent-minded  during the  mass,  were                trifles  for  us.  We  disregarded  penance  for  our  faults  and                complained  because  of  the  cross  you  sent  to  us.  O  Lord,   150                please forget our debts; deliver us from these flames burning                inside us. » In vain! The souls in purgatory are unable to pray                for  themselves.  They  are  plunged  into  their  bitter  suffering                without being able to help themselves!                      However, we can do what they can't. They are unable to                help themselves, but we are bound in duty by charity to help                them. The souls in purgatory are our neighbors, as they were                while living on earth; or better yet, they are our neighbors for                a greater reason, because they are confirmed in grace, and                therefore  we  must  take  care  of  relieving  them  from  their                painful condition. Furthermore, having the means of helping                increases our duty. To relieve","their pain and to hearten them in their most intense suffering,                we have not to share in their pain, nor to go on pilgrimages,                nor undergo maceration; some exercises of piety and works                implying little labor are profitable for those pitiable souls. We                can help them in many ways such as by hearing and offering                the mass, which relieves them greatly. We are told that St.                Gregory once delivered all souls from purgatory with one                mass. Surely, many souls ascend to heaven from purgatory                when we offer a mass. We can help them by saying the                rosary of the most holy Mary in their favor, making them feel                a paradisiac refreshment, or by offering alms, fast, prayer,                mortification, good works, and holy indulgences. The heroic                act of charity, the transfer of all our merits, indulgences, and                suffrages that we will receive after death, is also helpful for                the holy souls in purgatory.                      Now, don't you think that neglecting the elect souls who                are  wailing  in  the  midst  of  horrendous  pains  is  an                unaccountable cruelty, especially if we consider how easy is                for  us  to  help  them?  Please  meditate  a  little  while  on  the   151                following  truth:  we  are  able  to  relieve  the  souls  who  are  in                purgatory by doing a little work! What is keeping us waiting?                Imagine  you  are  entering  a  hospital's  room,  where  on  both                sides  sick  people,  struck  by  serious  disease  are  lying.  You                approach a bed and are terrified by the sight of a sick squalid                face,  the  chest  going  up  and  down  painfully,  and  breathing                his  last  death-rattle.  You  stand  aloof  frightened,  but  nearby                you see another man, whose face is disfigured by horrendous                sores; on his side you see another patient burning with fever                and thirst and calling to you: « I have not slept for five nights.                Please help me! » At this pitiable sight, you are moved; your                eyes  are  wet  with  tears...  But,  imagine  that  you  have  the                power to heal them in a moment. If you did not do so wouldn't","you be the most cruel person in the world? But you are more                than  cruel  if  you  neglect  the  souls  who  are in  purgatory  by                denying your helping hand.                         The Israelites were burning with thirst in the desert:                Moses hit the rock and clear water sprang out to quench their                thirst. The souls in purgatory are more thirsty than the people                of  Israel,  and  we  have  the  power  to  quench  their  thirst                through our prayer and other means. Do you know why we                have little interest in helping those poor souls? Because we                are  of  little  faith!  If  we  could  see  the  pitiable  state  of  those                souls, the whirling flames surrounding them, the divine justice                punishing them, this view would move us to mercy!                         If only those souls were able  to make us hear their                wails!  What  they  would  say  to  move  our  hearts!  I  suppose                that being unable to concern us with their state is one of their                most  terrible  pains.  If  they  could,  who  would  resist  their                complaint?  You  who  have  witnessed  the  death  of  parents,                relatives, benefactors, and friends, whose souls are probably                in Purgatory, you would not be so apathetic if you heard their   152                plaintive  echo  from  purgatory!  But,  if  we  are  not  moved  by                their pitiable state, even though we can help them with little                difficulties, at least let our own interest move us, because too                many  benefits  come  from  the  help  we  give  the  souls  in                purgatory.                         Helping  those  souls  attracts  the  protection  and  the                mercy of God, who delights so much in the appeasement of                His justice in favor of those elect spirits who are predestined                to the glory of paradise. When David's anger was appeased                by the prudent Abigail, he did delight in it, but not as much as                God  does  when  we  appease  His  scourging justice  with  our                prayer.                         In the first book of the kings we read that the prophet                David was ignited by righteous anger against the foolish","Nabal and moved with the army to punish him. But Nabal's                bride,  the  beautiful,  wise  Abigail  stood  ,in  the  middle of  the                way, knelt at the foot of the angry prophet, and offering gifts                prayed: « May your anger fall upon my head, but do not harm                Nabal.  Please  forgive  his  foolishness!  »  That  prayer                appeased  David  and  calmed  his  anger,  making  him  feel                happy for not having punished the fool-hardy Nabal. He said                to the imploring Abigail, « Blessed be your talk, o woman, and                blessed are you for restraining me from vengeance through                my own hands » (1. Kings 25, 33).                      Likewise, the people who help the purgatory's souls are                pleasing God, because while His justice scourges the souls.                His mercy feels sorry beyond measure. Then, let us do what                the  prudent  Abigail  did;  led  us  offer  gifts  and  petitions  to                appease  God's  right  anger;  let  us  give  satisfaction  for  the                faults of those souls, saying what Abigail said to the prophet:                «  Lord,  do  not  look  on  those  souls'  foolishness,  but  forgive                their failings. » God's justice will be appeased by our offering                and prayer; His mercy will prevail over those souls' faults and                Jesus Christ will say gladly: « Blessed be your speech and   153                blessed  are  you  who restrained  me  from  punishing  through                my own hands. »                      When we relieve the purgatory's souls with our prayer,                they invoke mercy on us from God. Unlike the worldly people                who  often  forget their  benefactors,  those  thankful  souls  ask                God  for  abundant  retribution  on  their  benefactors  with                constant petitions and with their most effective prayer. Those                devoted  to  the  souls  in  purgatory  know  all  this  very  well,                because they have experienced their protection many times.                For instance, some devout persons were attacked' by thief s,                but  those  blessed  spirits  appeared'  as  warriors  putting  the                bandits  to  flight.  Others  overwhelmed  by  dreadful  storms,                invoked the","blessed  souls,  and  were  delivered  by  them;  some  others                were  in  need  of  sustenance,  and  received  a  quick  helping                hand from those souls when they invoked them; and people                struck  by  disease  were  healed'  through  the  intercession  of                the blessed souls.                      These devoted to the souls in purgatory will experience                a  greater  benefit  when  they  themselves  descend  in  that                abyss. Every one hopes not to fall into the abyss of hell; but,                who  can  make  sure  of  avoiding  the  purgatory's  fire  before                going to paradise? Many of the saints we honor on the altars                paid  something  to  the  divine  justice  in  that  frightful  prison!                Where do you think we are going to pay the penalty for our                faults and' daily defects? We will see each other among the                purgatory's burning flames, and we are lucky if it happens so.                In  50  years,  most  of  us  now  in  this  church will  burn  in  that                purifying fire in the abyss. Then, a new generation of people                will  stay  here,  your  children,  grandchildren,  etc...  Then,  a                preacher,  perhaps  more  zealous  than  I  am,  will  sermonize,                trying to move them to .pity on their dead, namely, on us. But                now please remember what Jesus said: « God will apply to   154                you the same rules you apply to others » (Mt. 7, 2). It follows                that if you today neglect  so many souls who are waiting for                your  help  in  the  horrible prison  of the abyss,  God  will  have                you  also  neglected  and  the  future  hearers  will  remain                unconcerned with your suffering, denying their help to you.                      Let  us  look  after  our  interests.  Time  flies,  death  ap-                proaches.  Sights  of  death  surround  us.  If  you  follow  my                exhortation  today,  if  you  begin  interceding  to  relieve  those                souls, if you remember your forefathers and parents in your                prayer  today,  Gad  will  make  your  children  pray,  intercede,                and  relieve  you  from  your  bitter  pain  through  masses  and                alms!","Then, we are lucky! The flames surrounding us will die                out,  heaven  will  unfold,  and  the  angel  of  God  will  come                joyfully to us... (Speech, Nov. 2, 1879).                                             NOTES                     (1)  This  point  was  of  so  great  importance  for  our  padre  that  he                wrote:  «We  repeat that the  institute's  life along with  its  spiritual and                temporal existence as well  as  progress is  strictly tied to the Eucharistic                Communion  we  receive  frequently,  in  a  holy  manner.  But  without  the                spirit  of  meditation  and    prayer  one  cannot  be  fond  of,  nor  hasten  to                receive  Jesus  in  the  Eucharist,  nor  be  zealous  for  the  divine  Heart's                interests.                    How  can  a  person  long  to  join  Jesus  in  Communion,  when  she                does  not  kindle  herself  with  the  wish  and  love  of  Jesus  through                meditation on the adorable Jesus Christ, his Passion, and death? How                can she understand and desire him in the great mystery of the Eucharist,                if she does not meditate on this great mystery of infinite love? How can                she  bring  a  fervent,  immaculate  heart  to  the  Eucharistic  table?  The                person having no spirit of prayer will never detest sin, because dread of                sin springs up from meditation on the eternal truths, the Passion, and                death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wretch daughter, you cannot be called                Daughter of Divine Zeal any longer, because you have lost the zeal for   155                your salvation, since you neglected meditation. How can you shun sin,                since you have lost the fear of God, which is the outcome of meditation?                You  will  fall  from  sin  into  sin,  because  after  spoiling  and  defiling  the                grace and the religious wedding's beautiful dress, you will approach the                angels' table impudently!                    Thus, each Communion will be a new, grave debt to God as well as                a new deterioration of your spirit, giving new power and right to the devfl,                who will tempt and push you to evil » (S.'D.D.Z;).                     (2) «The more the meditation is concentrated, the more the intellect                knows  the  necessity  of  God's  help  and   grace  in   order to grow in                divine love,   holy virtues,  and  sanctification,  as well  as  to understand                the great moment of holy  perseverance.                    The  more  the  meditation is concentrated  on  the  divine attributes,                charity, the Passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ, the more the                intellect understands how much God is worthy of being loved and served                by the people, according to the state of their life.","When the intellect is enlightened by meditation, it moves the will to                reach these holy goals through prayer, the will itself esteeming prayer as                the best means. On the other hand, the prayer becomes effective when                through  meditation  the  person  becomes  fully  aware  of  her  goals,  and                that prayer is the best means to reach them. Hence, she will combine                prayer with cooperation» (S.D.D.Z.).                     (3)  As to meditation on the Passion, see chapter XXIII.                     (4)  Blessed   Fr.  James Cusmano   is   the founder of «Boccone                del Povero» in Palermo.                     (5)  «O  soul,  in  your  prayer  you  will  ask  the  Lord  for  the  spirit  of                meditation and penance, the victory over your passions, bad inclinations,                and the hellish enemies' snares and temptations as well. You will ask for                grace both to escape any sin, even the lightest and the involuntary one,                and  to  observe  your  rules  perfectly,  even  in  the  least  details.  In  your                prayer, you will  always  ask  the  most holy  Heart  of Jesus  for  the  Holy                Spirit  along  with  his  seven  gifts  of  intellect,      wisdom,      science,                counsel,   piety,   strength,   and   holy fear  of God. You will long for                these priceless gifts, imploring them with the most ardent petitions at any                time, especially in Pentecost time. You will always ask the Lord to give                you a new heart full of holy simplicity and purity,   remembering that you                are a Religious nailed to the most holy cross through the three nails of   156                chastity, obedience, and poverty. To observe these sublime virtues as                vows,  you will  ask  the   Heart  of  Jesus'   infinite  charity    for  help    and                detachment    from everything  and  everybody,  especially  from yourself,                your will, opinions,  desires,    and  anxieties    not-orderly    regulated.    In                short, you will ask him to make you as holy and perfect as he wants you                to be, even if you never seem to be aware of being perfect. You will ask                a profound contrition for your sins, as well as for grace to bewail them.                You  will  also  ask  the  Lord  to  grant  you  a  love  of  the  cross;  if  Jesus                grants you both the privilege to suffer and to like suffering, you will ask                for  suffering,  if  such  a  wish  comes  from  God  and  not  from  your                selfishness.  You  will  ask  such  a  gift  together  with  the  grace  of  love,                patience, and union with His divine will. At last, because many virtues                are implied in the spirit of sacrifice, you will ask for courage and a spirit                of sacrifice in everything» « We must pray for all families so that the fear                of God along with religion, good example, peace, and harmony will reign                in them; for youths so that the Lord may preserve them in his holy fear,                that he may bridle their passions, and bring them along the way of truth.                Pray  for  the  propagation  of  faith  and  the  holy  childhood,  for  the                conversion of the unfaithful, for the Catholic missions, the conversion of                the  dissident  nations,  that  they  may  become  united  with  the  Catholic                Church. We have to pray for the good success of the works","in the Lord as well as for the Catholic associations and the institutions                founded by competition, etc. (St. Paul). We have to pray that marriages                may be celebrated in the fear of God, and their offspring grow under the                Lord's blessing; that the religious orders progress in the holy observance                of their holy founders' rules. We have to pray for those who commend                themselves to our humble prayers, in which they confide sincerely.                 (7)     «  Let  us  pray  for  sailors,  especially  when the sea is stormy,  the                winds break through, and hurricane rages.  May the Lord guide, forgive,                and bring the sailors into the  harbor.  Let  us do the same for travelers                who are running  risks.  In times of  divine punishment, near or far from                us,  we  will  pray  to  appease  divine  justice,  asking  divine    mercy    to                temper  the  punishment  for  the  spiritual   good   of all.»                 (8)   «Instead  of  being  absent-minded   during   work,   it   is   better to                lift up our mind to God through vocal prayers in common such as saying                the rosary and offering prayer to the Lord.»                 (9)   Novenas and triduos to obtain graces:                In  all  occasions,  quandaries,  perils,  and  needs  we  should  resort  to                prayer, the golden key that opens the treasure of the divine graces and                mercies.  When  we  find  ourselves  in  such  circumstances,  usually  we                resort to the following six novenas: to the most holy Heart of Jesus, the   157                most holy Virgin under the most appropriate title, St. Joseph, St. Michael                the archangel, St. Anthony of Padua, and a special prayer to all souls.                If  we  say  two  or  three  novenas,  it  can  take  9  or  18  or  27  days,                depending on how many of them we say daily in the morning, at noon,                and in the evening. For an urgent grace, we may say the novena in 3                days  by  reciting  it  3  times  a  day.  For  a  most  urgent  grace,  we  may                complete the novena in a day by reciting it 9 times in the same day.                                         NOVENAS                        Saying novenas to obtain graces is a good custom.                        When a novena is said in common with fervor, proper prayers,                and songs as well as accompanied by exercises of holy virtues, divine                mass, and Holy Communion it is sometimes enough to make us receive                an important grace. If one novena is not enough, we may repeat it with                the  same  dispositions  as  many  times  as  we  need.  Because  our  Lord                created everything with order, weight, and measure as well as ended his                life with marvelous order, it is suitable saying the novenas in an orderly                way, without interruption. If we are going to say 3 novenas, we have to                say  them  successively,  one  after  the  other.  The  importance  of  this                regularity may be deduced from the","30 divine Gregorian masses, whioh must be celebrated in 30 successive                days, if we want to get our goal, according to the Church's teachers and                doctors.                                        PETITIONS                         The  petitions  are an effective means  of prayer  we are  using                since the beginning of our institution. They are written in the solemnities                and are presented on the feast of our Lord or the most holy Virgin or the                angels  or  the  saints  in  order  to  obtain  special  graces.  Before  being                presented, the petition is recited in common.                         Through such petitions we implore spiritual graces for the glory                of God, for our own sanctification, and the good of souls as well as to                obtain graces for a community house or for the whole order. We may                also  add  humble  petitions  for  temporal  graces  regarding  the  spiritual                good.                We must begin the petition with a thanksgiving for the favors we have                already  received,  praising,  blessing,  and  rejoicing  for  the  gifts  and                privileges  of  the  titular  saint,  in  whose  feast  we  humbly  present  the                petition.  Furthermore,  recognizing  that  we  are unworthy  to  receive  the                graces, we have to ask forgiveness for our sins, and show great trust in                our Lord Jesus Christ, the most holy Virgin, the angels, and in the saints'                merits.                                                   158                                          SONGS                         To  implore  graces  for  ourselves  or  for  others,  prayer                accompanied by songs is excellent; Because we have to praise, thank,                and bless God, our Lord Jesus Christ, the most holy Virgin, the angels,                and the saints, accompanying the prayer with song is beautiful.                The music of these songs must be totally different from that of profane                songs; it must be more or less liturgical, solemn and adapted to Latin                words as much as possible, especially when the song is written for the                mass.                        (10) «Jesus is prayed to under all his titles and mysteries of                infinite  love  such  as:  incarnate  Word,  child,  circumcised,  presented  in                the temple, flight into Egypt, etc. as well as to Jesus hidden, suffering,                teaching, praying, patient, crucified, and dying. The people pray to his                divine face, his Most Precious Blood, his most loving Heart. Other titles                under  which  he  is  prayed  to  are:  Ecce  homo  (behold  the  man!),                resurrected, seated at the right hand of the Father, hidden in the Holy                Sacrament,  exposed  on  the  throne,  passing  in  procession,  or  as  a                viaticum through the streets; he is prayed to as enclosed and dwelling in                the innermost part of our soul and heart...»","(11)  « The most holy Virgin too is prayed to in the mysteries of                her  pure  terrestrial    life  such  as:  immaculate,      baby,  3  years  old    in                the temple, St. Joseph's bride, visited by the Archangel, and associated                to  the  mortal  life  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  as  well  as  in  her  great                title  and  mystery  of  Our  Lady  in  sorrow.    She  is  venerated    as  the                Father's first  daughter,  the   Son   of  God's  Virgin   Mother,  the  Holy                Spirit's  spouse,  Queen  of  the  Apostles,    Mother  of  the  High    Priest                Mother  of  the  Church,    and  assumed    into  heaven.    Innumerable  are                the  most   holy  Virgin's  titles  regarding   her excellence   as  well   as                the  sanctuaries,  the  graces  granted  by  her,  her  apparitions,  symbols,                etc.  Hence  each  person  prays  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  under  the  title                most  appropriate  to  his/her  devotion,  but  especially  under  the  most                important,  common  titles that the Church  celebrates  in  the  eccle                siastical feasts.»                        (12)  See  how  our  padre    insists    on      recommending    the                thanks giving for the graces we have received; thanksgiving  is one  of                his spirituality's  characteristics.                        (13) On the occasion of unveiling a new statute of Our Lady in                sorrow.                        (14) We do not know when this letter was written and where it                came  from,  but  we  suppose  that  it  was  mailed  from  Rome  between                1905 and  1906. The  new  secret of holiness   is  the  devotion  under                the  title  Sacred  Slaver  of  Love  by  St.  Louis  M.  Grignion  de  Monfort.                Our padre seems to be saying that he has received new enlightenment   159                on  this  devotion,  because  he  was  aware  of  it  from  the  time  he  con-                secrated himself through this formula of his own, on June 10, 1888.                        «  Prayer  to  become  a  slave  of  Jesus  and  Mary:  O  my                sovereign  lady,  most  loving  Immaculate  Mary,  I  kneel  at  your  feet  in                spite of being an unworthy son of yours; please help me to become a                true slave of yours in order to become a true slave of Jesus.                        My  queen,  I  am  the  prodigal  son  who  after  30  years  of                absence, 20 of which were spent in perversion, wants to go back to his                Father's house, not  as a son,  but  as  an  absolute slave  of soul,  body,                thought, freedom, will, life, and death. O most holy Virgin, receive me at                the  entrance  of  my  king's  house,  but  first,  accept  me  as  your  perfect                slave,  in  order  that  I  may  surrender  myself  as  such  to  your  Son.  O                beautiful queen, please grant me this grace, as you did with your servant                De Monfort!                        Blessed De Monfort, for the sake of this slavery, for your zeal                in spreading it, please make me become a real slave of Jesus and Mary                by faithfully accomplishing the internal and external practices you have                taught! Amen.»                        (15) Our religious orders' solemn consecration to the most holy                Virgin in  the spirit  of  the Sacred  Slavery  was made  on  Dec.  8,  1906,","after a long, considered  preparation.  The  report was  published by  the                magazine Queen of Hearts, the confraternity's official organ. We quote:                        A page edifying our readers traces back to our confraternity's                origin,  relating  in  detail  how  the  priestly  order  of  the  Evangelical                Rogation by the Heart of Jesus and the Daughter of Divine Zeal, along                with  their  houses,  founded  by  Canon  Di  Francia,  consecrated                themselves to the Virgin Mary on Dec. 8, 1906. Their letter referring to                the resolve to put the two religious orders under the special protection of                the Queen of Hearts, was really overflowing with faith and love.                        They  forwarded  a circular to  their  houses  and  a letter  to  us,                petitioning  special  prayers  to  become  worthy  slaves  of  Jesus  in  Mary                and slaves of Mary in Jesus. They said: « Here, all of us are fascinated                and enamored of the doctrine revealed by the Blessed Monfort, apostle                of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  the most holy Mary;  we  are  longing to  become                slaves of the Madonna.»                        Their orderly preparation in the houses began on Nov. 5: in 33                consecutive  days, and  in compliance  with  the  Blessed's  counsel, they                made the well-known practices, read, and meditated on the Treaty of the                True Devotion and on The Secret of Mary.                        The prayer to the Blessed Monfort that Canon Di Francia wrote                on that occasion is worth remembering: «O glorious Blessed Louis Mary                of Monfort, we greet you as a living flame of love and zeal for Jesus and                Mary; we admire the divine wisdom that the Holy Spirit infused in you,                revealing the secret of the greatest devotion to the most holy Virgin; for   160                Jesus and Mary's sake we beseech you to help us understand such a                celestial doctrine and grace in order to embrace it. Please pray for us                that we may be worthy of becoming true slaves of Jesus in Mary and                slaves of Mary for Jesus! Amen.»                        On  the eve of the consecration,  all  of  them  kept  a strict  fast                offering what they had saved to Jesus and his holy mother for the sacred                slavery,  in  compliance  with  Blessed  De  Monfort's  counsel.  Their                secretary mailed the money, asking to have it deposited at the foot of the                Queen  of  Hearts  and  they  enclosed  the  list  of  the  persons  who                consecrated themselves along with a report, from which we quote some                passages:                        The consecration  of  ourselves  as slaves  of  love  to our  Lady                was fulfilled on the day of Immaculate Mary's feast...                        In the Evangelical Rogation's community, the consecration was                made  at  midnight  sharp,  the  time  when  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary's                privileged  soul  was  created  and  infused  in  her  virgin  body;  the                Daughters of Divine Zeal made their consecration the day after, before                the holy mass.                        In  both  institutes,  we  made  the  consecration  with  great                enthusiasm","and faith... undersigning the acts and placing them in a framework at the                foot of the most holy Virgin, our sweetest mother and owner.                        In  copying  out  the  names  (we  enclose  the  list  and  the  male                community's  title),  the  Blessed  Louis  happened  to  be  the  top  list  by                chance...  From  now  on,  he  will  be  our  special  patron!  How  much  we                enjoyed his Treat and Secret during this month of preparation! All of us                have been deeply impressed. These books are full of celestial fire, and                shoot arrows burning with love for the most holy Virgin, as the Blessed                Louis De Monfort did. For sure, he has a special place among the lovers                of  the Madonna.  May  he help us  live  faithfully  the spirit  of  the sacred                slavery we have embraced.                        Isn't all this edifying? On the anniversary day, every year, they                renew their consecration. The communities of the twin institutes renew                the act of consecration with the same transport and fervor as if it were                for  the  first  time.  They  make  the same  preparation,  and  celebrate  the                same liturgy on'the eve and on the feast. After Immaculate Mary's feast,                letters  full  of  tender  affection  for  Our  Lady  arrive  from  Messina,                Taormina,  Oria,  Giardini,  Francavilla  Fontana,  Trani,  San  Pier  Niceto,                etc.  They  enclosed  the  names  of  the  new consecrated along  with  the                saving from the fast, a small but sincere tribute for the sacred slavery of                love toward the great Mother of God. These letters give evidence that                these institutes hold the perfect devotion to Mary in great esteem.                        To  conclude,  we  point  out  that  both  the priests of  the Evan-                gelical  Rogation  and  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  renew  their  con-  161                secration of the sacred slavery to the child Jesus, supreme goodness,                with a charming formula, on Christmas.                         (16) The  consecration  of the  institute to  the  most holy Virgin                was  made  on  Dec.  8,  1906,  and  was  preceded  by  the  personal  con                secration,  or  better,  by  the  renovation  of  the  consecration  our  padre                made in Rome on   May 13,  1906,  in  the  sanctuary of  Mary  Queen                of  Hearts,  held  by  the  Monfort's  priests.  Our  padre  premised  a  triduo                of  holy  masses,  making  the  consecration  on  the  fourth  day.  Fr.  Boni-                celli  wrote:    «We  feel  that  we  can    stiH  see  him  going  to  the  front                of  the  sanctuary  after  the  celebration,  making  the  solemn  act,  and                praying  with  opened  arms  to  the  Beautiful  Queen,  as  he  called  the                Madonna.  Then,  he  went  out  fully  happy  for  having  strengthened  his                bonds  on  the  day  dedicated  to  the    most  holy  Mary's  humility,  on                May  13,  according  to  our order's  calendar.»  The  meditations  of  those                days on the sacred slavery are abbreviated in these brief notes.                     (17)  In  those  times,  the  feast  was  celebrated  on  the  third  Wed                nesday  after  Easter  as  a  first  class  feast  with  an  octave.  Pius  Xil                replaced it with the feast of St. Joseph the worker, on May first.","(18)  Let  us  remember  this  pious  industry,  which  is  one  of  our                padre's  characteristics.  «  He  wanted  to  create  for  himself  a  celestial                court  of  saints  who  would  take  special  care  of  our  orders.  He  chose                those  saints  who  in  their  mortal  life  showed  a  most  fervent  zeal  for                winning  good  workers  for  the Lord to serve in his  harvest,  as  well  as                those whose institutions are similar to the Anthonian ones. He believed                that these saints continue praying to our Lord for evangelical workers,                for  their  institutions,  and  for  the  faithful  who  follow  their  pattern.                Therefore, he wished to challenge them through special prayers in order                that they might consider themselves Celestial Rogationists or Daughters                of  Divine  Zeal.  He  proclaimed  them  as  such  with  specific  petitions,                calling to mind what they did on earth to spread charitable works as well                as  the  command  of  the  Rogate»  (Vitale,  Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di                Francia. page 231).                                                                                     162","CHAPTER V                         LOVE OF CHILDREN AND OF THE POOR                     As a practice of interior life, I will pay loving attention                to  my  neighbor,  striving  hard  to  form  within  myself  a                tender, compassionate, and understanding heart toward                my brethren.                     Since this pious institute is devoted to the salvation                of  children,  through  the  means  that  holy  obedience                allows me I will strive to commit myself to the education                of boarders and day students, longing for their salvation,                and asking the help of the most holy Hearts of Jesus and                Mary to achieve it.                     I will love and respect the poor of Jesus Christ with                faith and charity, holding them as the suffering members                of his mystical body, as well as being always fully aware                of  how  Jesus  Christ  exalted  them  by  declaring  that                whatsoever is done for the poor, is done to himself.      163                     I  regret  that  the  Ignorant,  lost  world  rejects  and                scorns  the  poor,  just  as  many  Christians  often  do.  I,                however, will lead the poor to follow the paths of eternal                salvation, and will hold them as great people, as princes                before God, according to the Psalm's saying, « their lives                will be precious in His sight » (Ps. 72, 14). Even though                they may be troublesome, I will be sympathetic by aiding                them, and helping them as much I can, and much more                by evangelizing and drawing them to God.                     Because our Lord Jesus Christ is supremely pleased                by works of charity, I will be attentive and compassionate                with the sick and the dying.                     By observing perfectly the precept of love toward my                neighbor;  by  loving  them  as  myself  I  will  achieve  my                personal sanctification by this most effective means.","THE ORPHANS                                 1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES                      Salvation of abandoned orphans will be one of the most                cherished  works  of  the  Rogationists  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus.                They will provide the orphans with a sound education and an                appropriate  profession,  with  fatherly,  loving  care,  they  will                infuse in them principles of Christian piety, and rear them in                the  holy  fear  of  God,  the  love  of  Jesus  and  Mary,  and                reception  of  the  holy  sacraments.  Finding  proper  ways  to                make  them  feel  secure  dear  and  joyous,  they  will  provide                them with the things they need, especially when they are sick,                regarding  the  last  of  the  orphans as  the  first  of  the  fathers.                When  the  orphans  are  ready  to  leave  the  institute,  the                Rogationists will endeavor to provide them with honest work,                and  watch  over  them  so  that  they  may  persevere  in  the                practice of Christian principles (C.R.).                      Religion is the foundation of a good education, and work                is the most effective factor of good discipline, far it forms the   164                chief  component  of  the  orphanage's  subsistence;  neatness                and hygiene are observed in detail (Rules for orphanage for                girls).                      Appropriate  rules  that  follow  from  our  educational                system will be read day by day to the girls as the basis for                their  good  behavior  during  their  educational  training.  The                superiors will demand observance of the rules.                      Both  the mother  superior  and  the  teacher  will  see  to  it                that  the  community  of  the  orphans  proceeds  with  perfect                discipline  and  order,  following  the  schedule  of  sound                principles, as well as the seasonal changes. The chiming of                the bell will be the time-signal, and they wild correspond to it                quickly and exactly (S.D.D.Z.).","I  have  received  your  printed  paper  of  Dec.  25,  1920,                through which you have asked my opinion on the Pious Hotel                Trivulzio  of  Milan  and  on  the  Council  of  the  Orphanages'                proposal to dismiss the male orphans from the institute at the                age of 12-15, entrusting them to their mother or to a guardian;                such  a  proposal  foresees  a  vocational  scholarship  for  the                12-14 year old orphans and a work scholarship for those of                15 years of age.                      If the children's education is satisfactory under the civil                and  religious  point  of  view  (I  suppose  they  have  arts  and                crafts), I am absolutely against such a proposal, because the                youths at 18 are well trained and capable of being successful                in civil life. On the contrary, delivering them to their mother or                to a guardian at the age of 12 makes their education come to                nothing, generally speaking.                      The  orphaned  boys  who  leave  my  institute  when  they                have reached legal age, are so well trained in education and                profession that they earn their living honestly. The chief point                is  basing  education  on  sound  civil  and  religious  principles,   165                which must be respectful of Gad, his holy law, and civil and                ecclesiastical authorities.                      Of  great  importance  is  the  watching  over  the  children,                and  counseling  them  against  moral  harm,  because  if  mis-                conduct is allowed, the orphanage cannot stand, everything                goes  to  ruin,  and  the  children  become  languid,  and                insensitive to education. Should be this the case, it would be                better to entrust them to a guardian. Everything depends on                the educators; they must not be the ones who are willing to                eliminate  all  the  educational  systems,  the  lay  one  excepted                (From  «  The  Orphanage  »,  bimonthly  paper  of  Milan,  Aug.                14-15, 1921).                      Please  train  the  orphans  in  discipline  and  work,  since                they are children. Later, they will be happy for that. Beginning                from their tender age, they must be taught to","comply  with  their  duty  toward  God,  themselves,  and  their                neighbor; by so doing, they are setting out on the right path                toward their eternal salvation. Everything passes away, bun                since  the  human  being  was  created  to  be  eternal,  each                Christian must always keep in mind his last goal, which is his                eternal salvation (1) (Rules for orphans, 1890) .                          2. SISTERS COMMITTED TO EDUCATION                      I make every effort to achieve the goal which is proper to                any  educational  institute,  that  of  providing  its  subjects  with                good success.                      I am fully aware of my duty and responsibility. Gathering                persons,  feeding  them,  and  leaving  them  merely  to  exist  is                not  the  educational  institution's  aim,  for  it  does  not  change                the abandoned orphans' fortune nor does it prepare a good                future  far  them.  Education  aims  at  regenerating  and                moralizing the persons who are rooted out of vagabondage,                enabling them to earn their living honestly.              166                      The  serious  task  of  educating  and  teaching  so  many                orphans  compelled  me  to  seek  out  and  to  form  good                educators.  I  first  applied  to  two  communities  of  sisters,                because  no  secular  teacher  may  compete  with  them  in                education; in fact, the nun is born of religion to be a mother, a                teacher, a friend, and a sister of the youth of whatever rank. A                sister,  being  educator  and  mother  of  the  youth,  represents                one of the finest missions of Christianity, especially in the last                two centuries.                      From the time I began gathering the female orphans I felt                myself in need of educators, but the Daughters of Charity and                the Daughters of St. Anne, to whom I had applied, rejected                my request, for I was unable to reward","their work. Then a too daring idea crossed my mind: the idea                of  farming  a  community  of  nuns  who  should  dedicate                themselves to my orphan's education.                      It  is  hard  believing  now  arduous  such  enterprises  are.                Where could I find youths suitable to such a mission? A few                persons in Messina think that I formed the community of the                sisters by selecting some youths from the orphans. But they                are  mistaken...  young  women,  willing  to  consecrate                themselves to God and charity came here from other towns                on purpose. They were not orphans; mast of them had and                have  parents  alive,  but  they  left  family  and  native  towns  to                devote  themselves  to  the  poor  abandoned  orphans'                education and service. They know their own mission: I myself                educated  them  to  such  a  school,  a  school  of  charity  and                sacrifice.                      I  am  fully  aware  of  the  caustic  criticism  of  this  hard                enterprise  of  forming  a  community  of  sisters  who  commit                themselves to the orphans' salvation. To tell the truth, if there                had been no critique, it would have been a marvel! Unluckily,   167                the saying that no one can be a prophet in his own homeland                is really true; I, however, feared the critique of the future mare                than  that  of  the  present.  What  I  really  feared  was  that  my                orphanage  could  come  to  nothing  after  my  death;  then                censure could rightly blame my memory for not having made                a lasting shelter of salvation for these poor orphans.                      This charitable institute's continuity has been ruling my                thoughts ever since. It has been the main object of my efforts,                but to reach this vital goal I needed to form a community of                sisters.  From  the  time  I  failed  to  engage  the  Daughters  of                Charity and the, Daughters of St. Anne, I conceived the idea                of founding the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                      Oh! If those who once censured me knew the stormy","events I passed through in order to found this congregation of                sisters  as  well  as  haw  I  froze  and  sweated while  gathering                orphans from the city and its surroundings! What a hard task                it was to educate so many orphans and form their educators                and teachers at the same time! (Speech, Aug. 20, 1906).                                      3. OUR MISSION                      Now our talk is about the orphanages, which represent                our  mission  of  gathering  scattered,  poor,  abandoned,                orphaned  children  in  order  to  save  them  spiritually  and                materially. We pursue this aim by delivering the orphans from                abandonment,  depravity  of  the  world,  hunger,  misery,                idleness, scandals, risks, and temporal and eternal ruin!                      Haw much the mast holy Heart of Jesus delights in this                work for the abandoned orphans' salvation! What a conquest                of souls is snatching them from the devil and bringing them to                God!                                                                          168                     Rescuing  an  orphan  from  a  deadly  future  along  with                providing  him  a  spiritual  and  temporal  well-being  is  such  a                redemption that it does not end with the individual orphan, but                continues  from  generation  to  generation,  bringing  about                innumerable goods!                      A  male  and  a  female  educated  orphan  who  succeeds,                will convey their education and morals in the midst of society                through  their  example  as  well  as  by  becoming  parents  of                children, with whom they will share the teaching of faith and                civilization, practice of piety and training they received in the                pious institute, where they grew up for God and their happy                future.                      Those  who  strive  diligently  for  the  salvation  of  tender                children,  in  wham  they  awaken  the  smile  of  love;  who                eliminate tears and desperation, deserve a great reward.","We would say that no work is so appreciated and pleasing to                the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  as  the  education  of  little                children. In this case, our Lord will not cry out with uttermost                anguish the utterance of the Holy Scripture, « What do you                gain by my blood? » (Ps. 30, 9) as he does at sight of the                frightful abuse the world commits against childish souls and                at sight of their unhappy life or eternal loss. On the contrary,                at  sight  of  the  holiest  mission  aiming  at  saving  the                abandoned,  derelict  orphans  as  well  as  at  sight  of  its  good                results, our Lord Jesus Christ will exclaim: What a gain by my                blood! These and the future souls are brought to my Heart by                my faithful ministers and my faithful spouses! Blessed be the                blood I shed in the midst of terrible suffering for the salvation                of souls!                      Everyone knows how much the child Jesus suffered for                the babies the impious Herod slaughtered when Joseph and                Mary  took  him  to  Egypt.  He  saw  those  babies  slaughtered                and  drowned  in  their  blood,  felt  their poor mothers'  torment                and  cries  in  his  most  sensitive  Heart.  He  experienced  that                horrible scene as if it were the occurring in his sweetest Heart   169                as well as the sword points and the sabre cuts piercing his                own Heart! And yet, he was consoled by the thought that the                babies who were slaughtered in his place would be glorified                in heaven.                      But  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  suffered  even  more                when he foresaw the numberless tender souls, who deprived                of parents and of an opportunity to be educated to a good life                by  zealous  persons,  would  be  left  open  to  the  spiritual                slaughter which is caused by sin.                      This  unheard  slaughter  has  happened  millions  and                millions of times ever since the world began! My daughters in                Jesus Christ, if you took care of yourselves only, you would                run the risk of eternal loss. Let us not hold our","own soul more precious than the souls of our brothers (Act.                20,  24).  Let  us  take  the  utmost  care  of  the  abandoned                orphans. But because this involves the education of childish,                young  souls,  we  must  expand  our  zeal  not  only  to  the                abandoned orphans, but also to the tender, young souls who                come  into  our  ministry,  whether  those  in  the  kindergarten,                those  in  day-schools,  or  those  in  the  orphanages.  These                institutions  are  concerned  with  the  salvation  of  present  and                future souls, pleasing the most holy Heart of Jesus just as the                orphanages do.                      Let us conclude by considering how great and immense                is the priceless reward that our Lord Jesus Christ will give the                lovely  brides  who  are  completely  committed  to  this  holy                mission. They will be rewarded during their life, at death, and                after-death,  because  their  mission  rejoice  forever  the  most                holy Heart of Jesus, the holy Church on earth, the heavenly                court  in  paradise,  the  angels,  the  saints,  and  especially  the                great mother Mary. (S.D.D.Z.).                                                                           170                              4. TAKING CARE Of HEALTH                      Usually,  the  orphans  must  be  taken  away  from  their                abandonment and poverty without exacting monthly tuition; it                would be a serious fault if the poor orphans were not received                for lack of funds. But the person who called our attention to                them or the intimate relatives can be asked for the bed and                accessories as well as for some clothes and a little frock, etc.                If  they  cannot  afford  to  pay  for  them,  either  they  or  the                institute  may  arrange  a  collection.  At  last,  whatever  the                results may be, the orphan must be received in the name of                God, whose creature the orphan is.                      In dealing with the children, the sisters will teach","them  hygiene  and  cleanness,  both  of  which  confer  and                preserve  their  health,  while  the  lack  of  hygienic  habits                deteriorate  both  their  oven  health  and  endanger  that  of                others.  By  receiving  the  orphans,  the  sisters  are  bound  in                duty not only to educate them procuring their spiritual good,                but  also  to  keep,  preserve,  and  improve  their  bodily                well-being.                      To protect the girls' health, the following items must be                taken into consideration:                     a.  The  institute's  topography,  which  must  be  airy  and                sunny, having gardens without humidity.                      b. The diet will be sound, avoiding both the insufficiency                of food and the overabundance of it. The amount of food is to                be  gradual  and  proportionate  to  the  child's age,  remarkably                increasing for those of about 13 years. Food is to be natural                and without complicated sauces or the like. The children will                become accustomed to the community food.                      The  sisters  will  spay  diligent  attention  to  the  child's   171                complexion, knowing that a pallid complexion and the lack of                interest  in  play  activity  are  symptoms  of  illness,  fever  or                indigestion; in such a case a remedy must be applied.                      The faucet lavatory must be suitable to the children. As                to the baths, they must be used with discretion.                      c. Lively, animated sport in the open air is conducive to                good  health;  in  case  of  inclement  weather,  the  children  will                play under cover, and the windows will be well, regulated for                good ventilation and temperature.                      d.  Air  must  be  always  pure;  the  dormitories  having                proportionate  air-holes  on  the  tap  and  the  bottom  must  be                airy  and  sunny  with  their  windows  open  all  day  long,  but                closed at dusk. The beds wilt be at a distance of about a yard                from each other; the windows will be high, and","some of them open enough to make air circulate in the night.                Besides,  the  dormitories  must  be  well  ventilated,  because                fresh  air  is  a  major  factor  in  maintaining  the  health  of  the                children. As long as the lungs breathe pure air, children will                be always healthy.                      In the regions where climate is hot, the people sleep with                open windows even in the night.                      Children are more susceptible to colds in the hot and in                the  middle  season  more  than  in  winter.  Usually  it  happens                because  they  expose  themselves  to  currents  of  air,  when                over heated and perspiring. This causes the pores to close.                As  a  result  they  are  afflicted  with  inflammation,  cold,  and                catarrh.  To avoid  these  inconveniences,  appropriate  care  is                needed. Specifically, windows and balconies will be closed on                the  windy  days,  and  to  provide  air  circulation  they  will  be                opened only for an adequate time when the community is out.                Special  care  will  be  taken  to  avoid  the  ebb  and  flow  of  air                when children pass through the corridors.                                                                          172                     A  sister  will  keep  watch  in  the  dormitory  at  night,                preventing the children from becoming chilled when they get                up from the warm bed when the air is cold. Catching a cold                and  catarrh  at  their  age  is  dangerous,  since  it  can  last  for                years, sometimes turning into phthisis.                      Do not accustom the children to wear woolen or heavy                clothes,   because   somehow   enduring   cold   weather                strengthens  their  health.  As  to  the  coverlets,  the  sister  will                provide  for  the  children  adequate  coverlets  as  the  cold                season approaches (S.D.D.Z.).                                 5. RELIGIOUS EDUCATION                      If  attentive  and motherly  care  of  the  orphans'  health  is                important, more important is their education in religious","principles, which must be the basis of their education and of                their temporal and eternal happiness.                      On arrival, the teacher will present the child to the Holy                Sacrament  and  to  the  most  holy  Virgin,  praying  them  to                receive that child under their protection. The teacher will also                encourage the little girl to say some «Hail Marys» and make a                little offering, while she, herself, will pray interiorly for the soul                that the Lord is entrusting to her.                      When the child experiences the loneliness of separation                from  her  relatives,  the  teacher  will  maternally  console  and                comfort her and cheer her at time with candy or some other                treat. The child will forget her loneliness if she is encouraged                to join the other children in their play activities.                      After  giving  the  main  rules  for  the  children's  bodily                health, of which we take responsible care, now we are going                to  deal  with  a  more  important  topic:  the  children's  spiritual                education (S.D.D.Z.).                                                                          173                     Thirty  years  ago  I  began  gathering,  educating,  and                providing orphans with a good future; ever since I have been                holding  and  experiencing  that  the  steady  base  of  any  civil                education  is  religious  education!  I  have  learned  from                experience,  reason,  faith,  learned  people,  and  common                sense:  that  to  form  a  civil  human  being,  an  educated  good                citizen, it is necessary to form a good Christian!                      If we educate the youths' mind about the knowable, we                must  also  educate  their  mind  about  the  Catholic  faith's                supreme  principles.  If  we  exercise  the  children  in  arts  and                crafts, we must also exercise them in prayer, lifting up their                mind to the purest region of light, where no distinction exists                between ranks and social conditions, but it does between the                virtues and merits of a Christian life.","Today, society is about to crumble, because the religious                base has been shaken, either in the education of the heart or                in  the  training  of  the  mind!  Generally  speaking,  school  has                become an environment of seduction, deceit, and depravity,                especially  in  the  cities.  Youth  are  entrusted  to  atheistic                teachers  developing  in  tender  hearts  hatred  and  revolt                against  ecclesiastical  authority.  You  are  witnesses  of  haw                young  people  finish  school  poisoned  by  false  teaching  and                historical lies, how they lack respect for priests, scorn religion,                and prepare unhappy days for themselves, their family, and                for society.                      If we look at the education of common people, we realize                that  the  consequences  of  an  atheistic  education  are  even                more pernicious. The unrest among the working class shows                it.  The  continuous  strikes,  revolts  against  civil  authorities,                hatred, crimes, and so many other evils give evidence of the                threat to the social order (2) (Speech, Jan. 31, 1909).                      Even  though  little  orphaned  children  do  not  yet  attend                the elementary schools, they must be educated in Christian   174                doctrine  from  their  tender  age,  beginning  with  the  first                elements. The younger ones will be taught orally, the others                will use the catechism booklets. The chief aim is to educate                the  children's  mind  by  appropriate  explanations,  tales,  and                biblical  stories,  avoiding  to  teach  the  elements  of  faith                mechanically.                      The  yearly  feasts,  especially  those  of  our  Lord  Jesus                Christ and the most holy Virgin, will be profitable means for                the sisters to help children lift up their mind and heart to the                knowledge of the adorable Jesus Christ. For instance, during                the holy week they will inspire a holy fear of God and a great                compassion for the crucified Jesus and his mother's sorrows,                infusing  the  sacred  melancholy  of  the  holy  days  in  their                tender souls. On","Easter, they will inspire the children with holy joy for our Lord                Jesus Christ's resurrection... The liturgical year's solemnities                can be rich in teachable moments.                      To  teach  Christian  doctrine  mechanically  to  children  is                nearly useless. To better impress the mysteries of faith in the                children's tender minds, they will vary the instruction through                careful  wording  of  the  catechism  and  the  use  of  lecture,                projecting  pictures  from  s4ides  and  explaining  the  truths  of                faith.  Teaching  Christian  doctrine  to  the  orphans  will  be  a                matter  of  great  concern  for  the  sisters,  who  will  devote                themselves  to  it  in  order  to  develop  the  spiritual  life  of  the                orphans.                      To facilitate attaining this goal and to win the enthusiastic                cooperation  of  the  children  in  learning  Christian  doctrine, at                the end of the year the sisters will invite some priests to the                exams; they will also use appropriate attractions in order to                allure children to a deep interest in important learning... A day                of  celebration  for  the  top  list  children,  as  well  as  other                profitable activities and awards, for effective teaching will be   175                rewarding without stimulating the children's pride (S.D.D.Z.).                (3)                      The  orphans  will  be  diligent  in  complying  with  their                religious duties, being pious and at home with God; otherwise                they will be unable to accomplish any good. After arising and                saying some prayers, they will do a brief meditation and then                attend the holy mass; they will also say the rosary and read a                spiritual  book  for  a  while.  At  night,  they  will  examine  their                conscience. Every Friday, they will say a special prayer to the                most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  to  whom  they  are  consecrated                under the title of Little Poor of the Heart of Jesus. They will go                to confession once a week, following the confessor's counsel                for receiving Communion.                     Vocal prayer must be paced in a moderate and calm","voice, with exact pronunciation, and devotion. Children must                be  exhorted  to  receive  the  most  Holy  Communion  with                profound  devotion  and  recollection,  making  an  appropriate                preparation and thanksgiving. Any action in common, such as                study, work, school, and eating will be preceded and followed                by a brief prayer.                      On Sundays and feasts, the schedule will allow for more                play-time,  and  also  more  prayer  and  spiritual  reading.  The                orphans  will  share  in  a  day  of  spiritual  recollection  every                month and in a three day spiritual retreat every year.                      The pious union of the Luigini Sons of Immaculate Mary                was created to increase faith and piety; the orphans whose                behavior merits it, will be awarded the prize of being admitted                to  the  union.  They  will be religious  not only  in  the  external,                practice  of  their  duties,  but  also  in  their  inner  spiritual  life,                always  having  the  holy  fear  of  God,  the  surest  guide  to                success (R.P.A.).                                                                           176                               6. EDUCATIONAL RULES                      To  aid  us  in  fulfilling  our  great  mission  of  helping  the                orphans  to  develop  good,  pious,  and  holy  characters,  we                indicate some of the specific rules and manners.                      1. Good example. (4) The sisters and the assistants will                endeavor to radiate observance, piety, zeal, charity, union of                hearts, and holy fervor as examples of virtues and holiness                for  the  edification  of  the  orphans.  The  sisters'  action  more                than the words must penetrate and edify the tender souls! As                little  as  they  may  be,  children  have  a  natural  power  of                perceiving  by  intuition  the  goodness  inherent  in  their                superiors'  behavior.  If  their  examples  are  bad  -  which  God                forbid! - the children by","intuition  will  form  their  own  judgments  and scorn  what  they                have  been  taught.  As  sound  as  may  be  the  teachings  by                words,  in  the  presence  of  actions  contradictory  to  the                teachings, they fade away like smoke under the wind's force.                      For instance, a sister making the sign of the cross before                little children in a careless or irreverent manner is implying to                them that the sign of the cross is unimportant. She may be                unaware  of  the  impression  she  is  creating.  A  sister  or                assistant  who  in  the  presence  of  even  three  years  old                children, speaks to the superior disrespectfully, diminishes for                them the principle of divine authority, which is shared by the                people who are in a position of superior. A sister or assistant                eating  or  drinking  greedily  in  the  presence  of  children,                teaches them gluttony in a masterly manner.                      We  could  give  many  examples  which  seem  trifles,  but                which have the power to waste he orphaned children's souls                because  their  pure,  tender  minds  are  able  to  feel  in  the                innermost the bad qualities that a teacher nurtures tacitly or                temporarily. For instance, if a sister or assistant is troubled by   177                a voluntary grudge against another, she is unable to conceal                it. Even the least perceptive child perceives it as though he                were penetrated by a magnetic influx.                      In the world, the ruin of souls which occurs in families is                a hecatomb. Education in the world has been defined: « The                most difficult art entrusted to the most inexperienced hands. »                People act, talk, and speak in the presence of  children as if                they do not understand what has been said or done. On the                contrary,  children  understand  very  much,  even  if  they  are                unaware  of  it;  in  fact,  babies  learn  to  speak  a  language  at                about the age of two years.","It was well stated by St. John Chrisostom: « Education of                children  is  the  art  of  the  arts;  no  human  art,  painting  and                sculpture included, can reach the merits of those forming the                children's  soul.  »  To  well  know  the  art  of  education,  one                should be a theologian, and a philosopher and a saint.                      And yet, those who left the world to dedicate themselves                to God in religion, seeking their sanctification, are able to lead                the tender souls toward a sound, moral, and civil education if                they  are  helped  by  divine  assistance  and  keep  in  mind  the                importance  of  education,  rules,  and  these  exhortations.  But                such education must begin with the perfect example that the                sisters  must  be  to  the  children,  since  they  are  called  and                committed to the sublime mission of education (S.D.D.Z.). (5)                      2. Prayer. Because everything starts well with God, the                sisters  who  are  committed  to  the  orphan's  direction,                education,  and  service  will  combine  good  example  with                prayer in order to educate them in a holy manner. Separately                from  the  orphans,  (6)  they  will  pray  in  common  at  the                assigned time every day with zeal and fervor so that our Lord   178                and the most holy Virgin may give them enlightenment in the                performance of their duty toward the orphans; and to give the                orphans  docility  and  grace  to  cooperate  faithfully  with  the                sisters' instruction, direction, and motherly kindness.                      3. Surveillance. Continuous, accurate surveillance is an                important  factor  to  keep  the  institute's  orphans  in  perfect                order. Watching over them is the master's, the vice-master's,                and the assistant's duty, but the major responsibility is that of                the master. Continuous, accurate, and careful surveillance is                the great preservative from any defect, hence it is called the                preventive method. From","the  sisters'  watchful  care  the  orphans  understand  the                importance  and  the  aim  of  surveillance,  and  they  learn  to                accustom  themselves  to  discipline  and  the  practice  of  their                duties.                      The  master,  either  personally  or  through  the  vice-                master,  who  should  be  fully  aware  of  his  high  mission  and                responsibility,  will  never  leave  children  abandoned  to                themselves,  otherwise  they  quickly  and  inevitably  become                negligent and inactive. The sister who oversees the orphans                must  keep  close  vigilance  over  them,  aware  of  all  their                actions and conversations.                      Most watchful will be surveillance during play-time. The                sister  will  be  most  alert  as  she  leads  the  children  to  the                recreational  area  annexed  to  the  institute  where  their  play                activity will allow them to let off steam; all of which improves                their  health,  as  well  as  their  physical  and  emotional                development.  In  their  play  she  will  be  attentive  to  prevent                rough  and  rowdy  actions,  which  could  result  in  harmful                injuries.  In  order  that  good  habits  in  working  and  playing   179                together  be  developed,  quarreling  and  poor  sportsmanship                will not be tolerated. No one should separate them from the                group, either alone or in pairs, but all should be within sight of                the person presiding. (7)                      4.  Holy  suggestions.  Both  superior  and  teachers  will                endeavor to instill in the children faith in divine things, love for                Jesus  and  Mary,  and  the  angels  and  saint.  By  speaking  to                them of God, of Jesus' love for them, his Passion and death,                as well as of the most holy Virgin's suffering at the foot of the                cross, they will affect them strongly with holy thoughts.                      The  sisters  will  bear  in  mind  that  a  pure,  virginal,                childlike mind learns readily the most holy, sublime truths that                are  communicated  to  them  in  a  simple,  easy  way.  The                marvels of creation such as the sun, the moon, the","stars, the fine days of spring, the field, the trees, the flowers,                the food they eat, the water they drink are topics to be talked                about  frequently.  The  sisters  will  make  children  understand                that all things are the work of God and everything has been                created  for  our  good.  By  showing  them  holy  images  and                much more with edifying stories the sisters will often talk to                them of Jesus as our Savior.                      To succeed in everything, the sisters first must be deeply                convinced  of  the  holy  truths;  they  must  be  spiritual  souls                giving holy examples.                      5.  Loving  manners.  For  Gads  sake,  both  superior  and                teachers  will  be  affectionate  and  respectful  toward  the                orphaned children, holding them as souls who are dearest to                the Lord, perhaps dearer than themselves, because they are                innocent and poor. In their affectionate care of the orphans,                the sisters will never make use of offensive or harsh words,                especially  when  dealing  with  those  marked  by  anger  anal                impatience,  not  even  when  it  is  a  matter  of  correcting,                reproaching, or punishing them.                           180                      That  the  orphans  may  develop  the  same  virtues,  the                sisters' relationship with them must be marked by meekness,                charity,  and  holy  zeal  as  well  as  by  a  pinch  of  sternness,                which will prevent the children from taking advantage of them                or becoming excessively familiar. The sisters will beware  of                partiality, because it can be detrimental for all: instead they                will love all in God dealing prudently with all in order to avoid                the  orphans'  taking  advantage.  Such  treatment  does  not                prevent them from rewarding the best, humble, obedient, and                observant children. But the sisters will not kiss even the least                one  of  them,  nor  will  they  permit  themselves  to  be  kissed                (S.D.D.Z.).","7. PARTICULAR RULES                      1.  We  know  by  experience  that  a  day  of  walking  from                early in the morning and in good weather improves effectively                the  children's  health.  However  they  should not  return  home                later than dusk. After hearing mass they may go out to walk                by  tramway  or by  coach,  if  the place  is  far-off;  at  least  two                sisters will accompany theses and see that the orphans eat                good food, and enjoy themselves all day long.                      The community of the orphans will seldom walk through                the  public  streets  of  the  city,  even  though  it  is  sometimes                useful  because  the  orphans'  walking  recollected  and  well                behaved  moves  those  who  see  them  to  admiration  and                compassion.                      When the orphans are invited to share in a funeral, the                superiors will usually decline the invitation, making exception                for  notable  persons  who  disposed  of  the  bequest  in  the                orphans' favor, or for those people who have donated a good                amount  of  money  as  recompense.  To  decline  the  invitation   181                the  superior  will  produce  good  reasons  such  as  these:  the                orphans cannot afford to lose the profit of their work nor their                time;  dressing  and  resuming  the  working  clothes  is                troublesome; the risk of catching a cold in winter time or in                hot days, etc. If they accept the invitation, both superior and                master will see to it that the orphans are dressed neatly and                behave with propriety in public.                      2. The orphans will have no relationship with outsiders,                and no stranger is allowed to approach them. A watchful care                must  be  taken  especially  when  masters  or  farmers  or  such                persons  are  working  in  the  institute.  Any  approach  by                outsiders may happen to be dangerous.","3.  If  children  have  parents  or  grand-parents  or  ben-                efactors, they will write to them on the main feast, their patron                saint's day, as well as any time they receive mail from them.                When parents or relatives come to call on them, the children                will  be  affectionate  and  respectful,  including  in  their                conversion  such  things  as  to  draw  them  near  the  Lord.                Besides  feasts  and  the  like,  the  visit  day  will  be  twice  a                month, and the sister will assist the children (S.D.D.Z.).                      4. Accompanied by a supervisor, the boys can see their                parents  or  relatives  every  Sunday,  always  behaving                respectfully  and  politely.  Before  letting  the  boys  go  to  the                parlor, the prefect must be sure that the visitors are parents                or relatives, excluding any strangers or the female cousins of                the same age. The same is true for the young girls. He will be                present  at  their  talk,  moderating  them  through  appropriate                words  and  considerations,  should  they  behave  improperly,                even  if  by  ignorance.  He  will  let  the  boys  accept  what  the                parents give them openly, but later he will search into things                or clothes to see whether money or notes have been hidden                (R.P.A.).                                                 182                      5. It is above all in morals that the boys of an institute                may become depraved. Nowadays malice is precocious, and                many boys enter the institute after already being exposed to                scandal in the world or in the family. When this evil enters an                institute and spreads into it for lack of surveillance, everything                goes to ruin: little by little all are affected by it; discipline fails,                and  religion  does  not  matter  to  them;  dependency,  work,                sincerity, and goad disappear; everything comes to nothing.                Hence  the  prefect  will  take  special  care  to  prevent  such  a                distressing evil to take root. To reach this goal:                      a. He will see to it that the boys go to confession","every week after making a good examination ,of conscience;                he will send for the confessor beforehand.                      b.  During  play-time,  he  will  be  watchful  to  prevent  the                boys from speaking in secret, or from bunching up and hiding                themselves in far-off ,places, or from forming an unobserved                group of 'two or three persons. Purposely, he will close the                door opening into the atrium, and refuse permissions which                give the boys a chance to stay two by two unobserved.                      c.  Prudently,  he  will  conceal  the  why  of  such  a                surveillance, attributing it to reasonable motives.                      d.  During  play-time,  he  will  not  allow  the  boys  to  lay                hands on each other, paying rigorous attention to prevent the                elder  boys  from  frolicking  with  or  caressing  the  little  ones.                Neither will he allow the elder boys to play with the little ones.                      e.  He  will  teach  the  boys  to  avoid  idleness  as  a  great                enemy, keeping them occupied with good games during the                play-time.                                                183                      f.  When  the  prefect  receives  a  complaint  against                someone,  he  will  question  him  tête  â  tête  with  much                discretion,  but  without  pretending  clear  explanations;  then,                after telling him to keep silent about the matter, he will refer                everything to the superiors.                      g.  He  will  encourage  the  boys  to  receive  Holy                Communion  frequently,  because  this  is  a  great  means  that                delivers from such an evil (R.S.A.).                      6.  The  information  is  an  additional  effective  means  to                keep order and discipline, as well as to prevent many evils;                informing the superiors about a serious matter prejudicing the                community or some of the fellows is commanded by the rules.","The boys are driven to act stealthly by instinct, and are                afraid  of  the  information;  hence,  they  try  to  bring  into                disrepute  this  duty  along  with  its  beneficial  means  by                borrowing the jargon of the world and the evil-doers, calling                the information espionage. They do their utmost to give this                word  an  ominous,  hated meaning  so  that  no  one  may  fulfill                the duty of informing the superiors; to root out this duty, they                persecute  the  follow  who  informs  the  superiors  with  their                anger, calling him a spy; furthermore, to show this brand of                infamy, they avoid him, do not speak to him, do an ill turn to                him,  etc.  All  these  means  are  a  manifestation  of  the                precocious malice that pretends impunity to bad actions.                      For that reason, the prefect presiding over the immediate                discipline of the boys will encourage the truth from them. He                will  do  his  best  with  fine  manners  to  make  the  boys                understand  that  the  duty  of  informing  is  for  the  common  or                individual good as well as for the great benefits coming from                it. He wild deal severely with those who try to bring the duty of                informing the superiors into disrepute; but, while inspiring love                and  esteem  toward  this  legitimate,  holy  duty,  on  the  other   184                hand he will inspire reprobation for the information given on                the ground of personal trifles or out of spite or revenge. He                will point out that this is the kind of information each one must                beware of because forgiving insults with meekness, patience,                and  mutual  sympathy  is  better.  Likewise  he  will  teach  the                boys  that  information  about  serious,  grave  matter  must  be                given with no passion, personal revenge, over-statement, and                lies, it must be given instead with an upright aim, saying the                pure truth (R.P.A.).                      7. Observance of silence is another important means to                keep  good  discipline  in  the  institutes.  The  prefect  will  be  a                solicitous guardian of this observance both in","the times and places established by the rules. If the prefect                wants the boys to observe silence, he will give the example                by talking in a low voice. Nothing else helps the pupils to be                silent as the teacher's talking in a faint voice. Even when the                prefect is reproaching the boys who did not observe silence,                the best means is to warn them in a low voice or by clapping                his  hands  without  speaking;  shouting  aloud  in  these                circumstances invites the boys to do the same (R.P.A.).                                     8. PUNISHMENTS                      Punishments.  When  children  are  educated  and  under                surveillance,  they  seldom  commit  faults  which  need                punishment, but a warning or reprehension is usually enough.                We point out again, we must follow Don Bosco's system, the                preventive  method,  which  wards  off  children's  faults  by                watching  over  them  in  such  a  way  that  they  have  no                opportunity to commit faults. Formed in a Christian spirit and                devotion,  they  will  feel  the  holy  fear  of  God,  and  avoid   185                committing serious faults.                      However,  since  human  nature  is  inclined  to  evil  and                some  people  are  bad-natured,  especially  those  born  in                poverty, it is sometimes necessary to combine religious and                civil  education  with  some  punishment  to  compel  them  to                behave.  In  such  a  case  the  following  rules  are  to  be                respected:                      1.   Punishment   will   never   be   frequent   nor                disproportionate  to  the  fault.  Punishments  are  like                medicaments: if used frequently, no benefit is received from                them, and, therefore,  people  feel  compelled  to  increase  the                amount; but the more the medicaments are used, the less is                their  beneficial  effect,  and  other  medicine  has  to  be                substituted.","An  institute  of  education  under  the  sisters'  direction  cannot                adopt  this  course,  using  punishments  as  to  reach  such  a                degree  that  the  pupils  become  unconcerned  with  them;                should  it  happen,  the  institute  would  become  a  house  of                correction, the children's community would go to ruin, and the                spirit of the sisters who are devoted to education would come                to an end because they would find themselves in difficulties,                would  become  annoyed  loosing  internal  peace,  etc.;                everything  would  be  in  disorder.  Punishments  must  be                proportionate to the faults. When they are applied in excess,                like  medicaments  they  harm  the  patient,  sometimes  even                killing. Hence, the sister will never punish out of resentment,                but when she is compelled to punish, she will act according to                reason punishing less than it is due.                      2. Before imposing a penalty, even a light one, the sister                must  ask  the  Lord  for  enlightenment,  so  that  no  one  is                mistaken.                      3.  When  punishment  is  over,  the  child  will  go  to  the                sister  who  inflicted  the  punishment  to  give  thanks,  beg   186                pardon, and promise to amend. It would be also useful to tell                the  child  to  confess  soon  if  the  fault  was  somehow  grave;                otherwise, when the confessor comes again.                     Material  punishments  are  to  be  used  very  seldom  and                with  .much  discretion,  because  the  teachers'  active  sur-                veillance,  the  good,  moral,  religious  education,  the  fine                relationships  of  pure  holy  affection  between  teacher  and                pupils  are  the  best  mean's  to  prevent  faults;  therefore,                punishments should not be used. On the contrary, relaxation                of  surveillance,  lack  of  affection,  the  teachers'  giving  bad                examples are the cause of faults and of punishments, which                demoralize the institute. In such a case, the sisters would be                worthy of punishments more than the pupils.","9. TWO MORAL PUNISHMENTS TO BE PREFERRED                      1.  Simulated  subtraction  of  affection:  driving  back  the                approaching  child,  showing  a  sullen  face,  and  showing  no                love are moral punishments. When friendly relations of pure,                holy   affection   between   teacher   and   pupils   are                well-established,  simulated  withdrawing  of  affection  is  the                greatest  punishment,  which  may  be  emphasized  and                prolonged according to the faults.                      When  a  sister  approaches  the  child  who  is  being                punished, she may be of great assistance by helping the child                to  reflect  upon  her  fault  and  the punishment,  and  exhorting                her  to  go  to  the  teacher  who  imposed  the punishment.  For                good results, it is indispensable that punishment be used very                seldom.  Its  frequent  use  becomes  abuse;  in  fact,  the  wise                educator strives to prevent having to punish faults.                      2.  If  a  young  candidate  or  daughter  of  Mary  behaved                badly,  she  could  be  threatened  with  the  removal  of  the                blessed  medal;  should  she  persist  in  the  fault,  the  threat   187                should  be  carried  out  for  some  days.  A  sister's  intervention                would do the utmost to make the candidate understand her                fault, emphasizing that the punishment the superior gave to                her  is  greater  than  others,  and  that  a  material  punishment                would be better. For these reasons, this punishment will be                used very seldom.                      We repeat over again that the religious, moral education                as  well  as  good  example,  active  surveillance,  and  mutual,                pure, holy affection are the best means to prevent faults and                punishments; when they happen, however, lifting the mind to                God  to  invoke  help  before  punishing  is  also  indispensable.                But faults are not to be always punished, since sometimes we                have to dissimulate or to give a benevolent interpretation to                them.","We give a summary of what has been said:                        1. Prevention of the faults; we have to put children in                the moral condition of committing no faults by giving them a                holy,  loving  education,  good  example,  and  active,  accurate                surveillance as well as by keeping them occupied, separated                from outsiders, and by praying for them.                        2.  Rare  and  moderate  punishments;  after  invoking                divine help and seeking advice, we should use punishments                calmly,  disposing  children  to  accept  them  reasonably  and                lovingly.                        3.  Pious  industries  and  strategies;  these  aim  at                repentance and amendment.                        4.  Exhortation  to  confess  the  faults  with  sincere                sorrow, making steady resolutions.                        5. An excellent step for reconciliation is exhorting the                repented people to go to the chapel in order to ask the Lord   188                and  the  most  holy  Virgin  for  forgiveness,  promising                amendment.                      The  sisters  committed  to  education must  be  convinced                that dealing with punishments is a very delicate matter, only                helpful  in  avoiding future  faults  when  it  is  well  handled;  but                when faults and punishments increase because of the sister's                faults, the punishment is harmful instead of helpful.                      REPRIMANDS.  They  must  be  applied  with  calm  and                good manners, otherwise they kill instead of edifying. Besides                behaving  with  dignity,  persuading  the  people  is  also                necessary  in  order  that  children  may  understand  and  hate                their faults.                      CORRECTIONS.  When  the  fault  is  private,  it  must  be                corrected  in  private;  the  superior  or  the  teacher  may  also                correct a public fault in private giving some punishment","to the person at fault, when they deem it necessary to put an                end to it (S.D.D.Z.).                      The  prefect  will  never  reproach  nor  punish  in  public  in                these two following cases:,                      1.  When  he  foresees  a  reaction  from  the  boy,  which                would cause scandal and a greater stubbornness. In such a                case, it is better to correct and punish privately.                      2.  When  reproaching  a  private  or  nearly  ,private  fault,                which  might  cause  or  confirm  a  scandal  by  calling  the                people's  attention  to  it.  Besides,  concealing  some  faults  to                little  children  such  as  theft,  dishonesty,  or  serious                insubordinations is sometimes better.                      An excellent method of education that the prefect of our                institutes  will  adopt  is  persuasion.  Either  in  the  case  of                correction or punishment or warning, the prefect will strive to                persuade the pupils of their fault through fatherly, but resolute                words;  after  disproving  their  excuses,  he  will  sometimes   189                require  their  assent,  as  for  instance  by  asking:  are  you                persuaded of your fault? Do you agree with what I have said                to  you?  And  the  like.  He  wild  use  persuasion  to  condition                children  to  accept  punishment  favorably  and  profit  by  it                (R.P.A.).                                  10. SPECIAL CAUTION                      I  call  the  attention  of  the  sisters  who  are  committed  to                education.  Besides  what  we  have  recommended  for  the                success of the children, they also must use special caution to                enhance the chance of success for a child, even though she                is the least one, and to avoid an irretrievable blow. We look at                it.                      A child sometimes happens to oppose the teacher's will                by instinct, without being fully aware of it. In such","a  case  it  is  the  teacher's  will  that  must  prevail.  She  must                tactfully  move  the  child's  will  to  her  own  in  a  way  quite                unknown  to  the  child.  The  teacher  will  be  delicate  in  using                holy,  loving  dynamics,  also  adding  prayer  because  without                divine help not even a child's will may be subdued. In other                terms, the teacher will pretend that the child's behavior is not                stubbornness. But, let us come to the point that could harm                the innocent soul.                      Suppose  that  a  child  is  at  fault  against  the  teacher's                orders in various little things; for instance, the child is restless                during the work and the mother superior is acquainted with it.                Suppose that the mother superior goes to the children, asks                the teacher how they behave and the teacher answers: « All                is  well.  »  If  the  superior  says,  «  I  know  that  this  child  is                restless at work, gets up, goes away, etc., » the teacher has                to speak wisely and well of the child by saying: « It is true, but                not always; it sometimes happens because the child does not                feel  well;  however,  she  is  amending  and  is  going  to  work                calmly  and  willingly  as  the  others  do  or  even  better.  »  The                mother superior will conclude: « I am sure of that; this child   190                will perhaps surpass the others. »                        But,  if  the  teacher  says:  «  Ah,  my  dear  superior!  This                child acts on her own account and will; I do not know what to                do any longer, because I am unable to correct her; she does                not listen, therefore I cannot deal with, etc... » she would be a                fool and would harm that child.                      Should  the  answer  be  this  one,  the  teacher  would  not                only be yielding to the child but would be also showing great                imprudence, as to destroy both authority and effectiveness of                corrections.  The  child  would  rejoice  interiorly,  because  her                childish  will  would  prevail  over  the  teacher's  will,  but  she                would  not  have  the  heart  to  amend,  because  she  was                distrusted before the mother superior.","It would be worse than ever if the teacher's declaration                of  impotence  were addressed  to  the  children  themselves;  it                would happen in the case of a request of the superior or to                give  free  play,  if  the  teacher  said  before  them:  «  I  cannot                stand  it  any  longer  because  these  children  are  bad,                undisciplined, and do not obey; I cannot do anything because                they do their own will, etc. » Oh! Poor children! It would be                the same as killing them! Those children would become such                as the incompetent, imprudent, bad teacher described them!                Such a teacher should never act so unwisely as to ruin those                children or she should never teach.                      To sum up, the wise teacher will never distrust children,                but on purpose will justify their little faults so that the children                may  not  think  of  themselves  as  mischievous;  nor  will  the                teacher declare impotence, but confidence. It has been wisely                said about education of children: « You must not make them                do, but make them want to do. »                      When questioned about a group or class, the teacher will                beware of saying: « All of them are restless, unbending, etc. »   191                On  the  contrary,  the  answer  will  be  such  as  this,  «  on  the                whole, I am glad. » Then, the teacher will shove to the mother                superior the good qualities of the children who are doing well,                will touch on some defects, and will add that they have goad                will to improve. Speaking this way has an additional benefit:                knowing that the teacher justifies children before the mother                superior, they will become more affectionate to her.                      It  is  obvious  that  such  delicate  methods  concern  the                communities of little children where the educational system is                fostered  by  the  spiritual  trend,  prayer,  reading,  practice  of                sacraments, teaching, etc...","11. STUDY AND WORK                      1. The boy orphans are trained in arts and crafts, the girl                orphans  in  feminine  works.  Both  are  trained  by  specialized                elementary school teachers, and those favorably disposed to                music  attend  appropriate  lessons  to  cultivate  their  talent                (Statutes of the pious, charitable institute called « The Poor of                the Sacred Heart of Jesus », 1890). (8)                      Because  they  will  be  obliged  to  earn  their  living  when                they leave the institute, the orphans need to work with love,                attention, and in silence taking care of all tools and material                as well as the books, paper, pens, etc. Those making special                improvement in the work and study will be awarded (R.O.).                      The  orphaned  girls  of  Immaculate  Mary  house  will  be                fond  of  work  as  the  means  to  succeed  in  life,  whereas                idleness leads to ruin; therefore, they will learn to work with                love and diligence as a means of earning their living (R.O.).                      The girl orphans who have been trained in the feminine   192                works and are working for commissions will share in the profit                of their work; their money will be registered, even though they                may  be  unaware  of  that,  receiving  it  when  they  leave  the                institute (Circ. Jan. 1925).                      Both  teacher  and  vice-teacher  will  watch  over  them                when they work or attend school, taking care that they work in                silence.                      As to the school, we have to resort to lay teachers only                when it is indispensable and after praying and gaining reliable                information, because they must be pious, modestly dressed,                church goers, docile, and expert in teaching. At the end of the                school  year  the  award  distribution  will  be  organized  in  a                show, in the presence of guests (S.D.D.Z.).","2. Let us consider the administration. What do we do to                maintain so many persons? Where do we. get the necessary                means?  Besides  paying  the  rent  for  the  boys'  institute,  the                orphanages'  maintenance,  installation  and  improvement  of                arts and crafts as well as continuous building, we keep 160                persons. All this requires an amount of about 40-50,000 liras,                every  year.  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  can  we  gather  such  an                amount in Messina? Can we rely on the civic charity for this                money?                      You know what the generous population is able to give.                So  many  charitable  institutions  along  with  their  charity                bazaars,  raffles,  and  charity  walks  give  little  margin  for  an                institution  of  160  persons  and  needing  an  amount  of  about                40-50,000 liras a year to keep going. In the presence of our                beloved  archbishop  of  Messina  and  so  many  ladies  and                gentlemen I say that these institutes for orphans do not keep                going and developing through alms and donations, because                alms and donations are hardly a fifth of the yearly economical                figures of the following report.                                                                          193                     The city-hall contributed 3,000 liras, the province 1,000;                what  the  sisters  begged  amounted  to  3,000,  monthly                contributions to 1,000, casual alms to 1,000; altogether, these                figures amount to 10,000 liras a year. How. do we meet the                remnant money?                      Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  have  always  deemed  that  an                institute  for  the  education  of  children  and  youths  cannot                pretend  to  keep  going  on  alms  only;  it  would  seem  like  a                strong young person who would like living on begging instead                of  working.  A  charitable  institution  is  allowed  to  ask  help                within  some  bounds,  only  when  the  inmates  are  unable  to                work such as the blind, cripples; feeble old persons, or little                children. But relying mainly on alms","to maintain an institute for youths jeopardizes the educational                system.                      The  youth  must  be  trained  in  a  salaried  work  from the                time of their childhood. For an institute of education, work is a                main  factor  for  building  morals  because  it  keeps  order,                discipline,  life,  and  guarantees  the  future  of  the  youth  by                teaching them how to earn their living through the sweat of                their brow. Without work, neither religious nor civic education                is possible. Pray and work formed the motto of the western                hermits,  who  proclaimed  that  we  have  no  consistency  of                religious principles without work, and they said so in spite of                being dedicated to transcendental asceticism.                      I  nurtured  these  ideas  from  the  very  beginning  of  this                foundation,  and  yet  I  have  endured  for  so  many  years  the                criticism that my program fosters idleness in the orphans! On                the  contrary  and  despite  the  expense  figures  for  rent,                building, maintenance, and installation of arts and crafts, as                reported above, we have drawn the means to enable the two                charitable institutes to continue through steady work and hard   194                industries. Thanks be to God.                      Our  installing  a  mill  and  a  bakery made  us grow  older                beforehand,  but  we  have  solved  a  big  problem  of  our                institutes by earning the daily bread through the pure wheat                bread  sale;  this  work  is  contributing  to  our  expenses  with                about  1,000  liras  a  month  and  is  giving  the  people  bread                perfectly  hygienic  and  nutritious,  which  is  considered  the                surest  one  to  our  great  satisfaction.  (9)  We  had  already                installed  a  clothing  factory  for  various  products  such  as                stockings, shirts, shorts, shawls, under vests, and the like.                      While visiting the exposition of our works, you have seen                embroidery in white, silk, and gold, crochet works,","pillows  for  lace  making,  golden  yarns,  old  fashioned  laces,                man-made  flowers  of  paper,  cloth,  and  metal.  Quite  a  few                years ago we started a floriculture; fresh flower wreaths made                by  our  orphans  signifying  the  incense  of  prayer  for  dear                memories,  while  bunches  of  roses  or  gardenias  are                perfuming rich tables of weddings. Incidentally, I add that we                have installed a shoe factory, a tailor shop, and a typography                in the boys' orphanage. With this, I end my report.                      Ladies and gentlemen, you have noticed that a supreme,                invisible  hand,  the  hand of  divine  providence  has  driven us                from the humble beginning, from the dark slums of Avignone                quarter up to the founding of two charitable institutes, to the                opening  of  two  other  houses  in  the  province,  and  to  the                formation  of  a  community  of  sisters,  who  are  trained  in  the                school of sacrifice and charity, who are learned in literature                and  art,  who  are  going  to  continue  the  rescue  of  the                abandoned, unsafe orphans. To conclude, let me say these                words to you: « I recommend my orphans to you. »                      I  am  not  asking  of  you  the  usual  alms!  I  know  that  so   195                many charitable institutions in Messina knock at your door, so                I want to be reasonable in my requests. The orphans and I                are most grateful far the contribution that you have given in                various circumstances, but now I am asking these additional                favors:  your  moral  support,  your  benevolence,  your  pious                consideration on these institutes, your good will to help them                not  only  through  alms,  but  even  better  through  your  advice                and  good  acquaintances,  especially  when  a  word,  a                recommendation may help. I ask of you not to accept easily                the unjust censure or rumors that people spread among you                in order to estrange you from me, by speaking ill of me and of                my activities as if they were based on a bad administration or                were","profiteering  through  the  institutes'  industries.  Ladies  and                gentlemen,  censuring  and  demolishing  is  an  easy  task,  but                you are wise enough and experienced enough to understand                how much it takes to build something important.                      Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  ask  of  you  an  additional                facilitation  that  you  cannot  deny  to  these  orphans  who  are                standing enraptured before you. Since they earn their living                by work more than by begging, and since you may need an                embroidered trousseau for your daughters who are going to a                conspicuous  wedding,  please  commission  it  at  our                orphanage. For instance, if a young married couple is coming                back from the church and you want to give them a basket of                flowers  as  a  gift,  please  remember  these  orphans  who  are                asking you for work. On Nov. 2, you are going to lay down a                fresh  flower  wreath on  the  tomb  of a  beloved  dead:  please                resort to these orphans, who while settling up the flowers will                also pray for the repose of your cherished soul, who will be                delighted in it. If your family uses knitted goods and you need                some of them, please commission them from these orphans,                who will serve you both punctually and exactly.           196                      Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  ask  you  for  work.  If  the  little                children of my orphanage have the right to ask your alms, the                youth already trained in the work do not like living by begging,                but want to work, even though they have to shorten their rest.                While eating their daily bread, they want to say, « we earned                it through our benefactors who gave us a profitable work. May                God bless them » (Speech, Aug. 20, 1906).                           12. THE MILL AT SAN PIER NICETO                      Pray  and  work!  is  both  the  motto  of  the  Catholic                institutions and the rule for any well-doing. Prayer indicates","the worshipping of God, the holiest religion, and your keeping                in  mind  Jesus'  saying,  «  You  can  do  nothing  without  me  »                (Jn. 15, 5). Work indicates that the human beings must not be                idle expecting everything from God, they must instead bend                to work in order to comply with the Bible's saying, « With the                sweat on your brow shall you earn your bread » (Gen. 3, 19).                These words almost have a literal application to the sowing of                the wheat, which is the chief element of life. Everyone knows                the anguish the people endure while sowing in the midst of                weather  conditions,  harvesting  and  threshing  under  the                scorching  sun  as  well  as  while  taking  care  of  the  work  in                order to make wheat bread.                      If  there  is  any  aliment  which  must  be  accompanied  by                prayer, such an aliment is wheat, because our Lord taught us                to ask the daily bread and the Bible tells us to learn from the                ants: « The ants, a race with no strength, yet in the summer                they make sure of their food » (Prov. 30, 25).                      Wheat is a great blessing of God. It is the divine provi-                dence's most consoling, expressive sign. The bags full of this   197                blessed  earthly  fruit  coming  back  and  forth  from  the  mill,                transformed into flour in a few minutes, and then worked into                bread cannot help touching the Christians who should see the                divine providence's benefits in everything.                      Bread is so sacred that it makes us bless the donor; for                this  reason  picking  up  and  kissing  it  when  it  falls  on  the                ground is appropriate. The offering of bread, flour, and wheat                to  God,  who  is  the donor  of  any  good,  was  considered  the                most  sacred  in  the  Old  Testament...  better  yet,  God  was                jealous of wheat pretending the offering of its first fruits as the                most pleasant.                      Even though modest and in the first stages, this mill","also represents other things: because it is born in the hands                of priests along with sisters and is baptized with the blessing                of the priest of God, it shares in the humanitarian institution                which takes away so many poor children from the social risks,                sheltering  and  forming  them  into  good  Christians  through                prayer  and  work.  Oh!  How  marvelous  is  the  sound  of                children's  voices  ascending  from  their  innocence  to  heaven                when it is combined with this clamor of the driving machine                and the stones transforming wheat into flour! On one side is                the  blast-furnace  that  works  this  wonder  in  the  sight  of  the                human beings; on the other side is the children's living flame                of faith that supports this miracle in the eyes of God.                      This factory standing between the church and the pious                institute,  and  the  inspiring  sight  of  the  religious  garb,  is  a                moralizing  element  training  and  teaching  these  tender                daughters of Niceto's population what work means, and what                they  must  do  if  they  are  to  eat  the  bread  that  divine                providence provides. It reminds each one to lift up his mind to                the operations of divine providence, in the holy fear of God,                who can make this chief aliment disappear in a moment.    198                      People of St. Piero, woe if tomorrow you do not hear the                roar of this revolving wheel and the grinding stones when you                pass by! Woe if you have no wheat to grind! What a gloomy                thought arose in my mind by the view of this mill and the tons                of  wheat  being  transformed  into  flour  to  be  delivered  to  so                many poor families! God is giving us bread in these terrible,                threatening times; but He can also withdraw His helping hand                as He sometimes does to punish our faults!                      Unfortunately  we  are  living  in  a  time  of  divine  punish-                ments,  and  the  ghost  of  famine  is  likely  to  rise  from  the                bloody, grievous war. The submarines sink the ships full","of  wheat  going  to  feed  the  people,  while  the  fields  are                abandoned  for  lack  of  workers.  What  next?  Nowadays  the                view of a mill receiving wheat and giving flour is a lesson on                the holy fear of God by reminding human conscience that our                default  may  dry  up  the  source  of  divine  providence;  on  the                other hand, it also reminds us to be faithful to our Lord Jesus                Christ and to his holy law, if we want the daily bread not to                fail.                      Seventy years ago, when the most holy Virgin appeared                to the innocent little shepherds Melanie and Maximin on the                mountain of La Salette, in France, she said to them: « The                arm  of  my  Son  is growing heavier  and I  cannot  hold  it  any                longer.  Nuts  and  grapes  will  rot.  »  After  touching  on  the                danger of famine, she added: « It the people convert, every                stone will become a heap of wheat! » Generally speaking, the                people are not likely to convert. Nations and governments not                only do not return to Jesus Christ's feet, but when the chiefs                of  the  nations  in  Europe  name  God,  they  make  politics  by                using  His  name  as  to  have  Him  on  their  part.  Human                madness, how far astray you go!                           199                      Will  we  give  up  hope  for  receiving  forgiveness  from                God? Doesn't God see those who fear him with holy, filial fear                of the earthly conflagrations? If a man fears the Lord, evil will                not come his way (Eccl. 33, 1).                      This little factory that starts the bread-making of wheat,                which  is  the  first  fruit;  this  mill  almost  connected  with  the                temple of God, this useful industry born of a priest and a few                sisters  under  the  protection  of  faith  and  surrounded  by  the                prayer  and  the  work  of  so  many  little  creatures  of  God                teaches  us  the  meaning  of  divine  providence,  the  gratitude                due to the donor of all goods, and the holy fear we must have                when we eat the bread coming from this mill. St. Augustine                wrote that our marvel","at the produce of a seed forming one ear of wheat with 1,000                grains  must  not  be  less  than  our  marvel  at  the  miracle  our                Lord Jesus Christ worked when he fed 4,000 persons with 5                loaves. How grateful we should be toward the Most High, who                gives  us  enough  wheat  for  our  daily  bread,  as  well  as  the                facility to transform it into flour!                      I  cannot  help  saying  the  last  reason  which  is  strictly                connected  with  today's  circumstances.  If  wheat  is  the  most                sacred among the products of the earth because it signifies                divine providence and gives us the daily bread, which Jesus                Christ  taught  us  to  ask  and  work  for,  we  also  have  to                somehow  consider  it  as  the  material  which  forms  the  most                august Sacrament, the Most Holy Eucharist. For this reason                the  prophet  Zechariah  said:  Corn  will  make the  young men                flourish, and sweet wine the maidens (Zech. 9, 17). Here, the                corn  signifies  the  Holy  Sacrament,  Jesus  Christ's  adorable                flesh; the wine, his Most Precious Blood. We receive both of                them  along  with  Jesus  Christ's  soul  and  divinity  in  the                Communion.                                                                          200                     From this point of view, the installation of our mill is of                greatest importance for it provides pure flour for the hosts that                perpetuate our Lord Jesus Christ's sacramental life on earth.                A  mill  that  makes  sure  the  forming  of  such  an  august                Sacrament  for  the  souls'  spiritual  life  is  somehow  a  divine                institution!                      Ladies and gentlemen, I let you know that with this mill                we aim at our best service to the Eucharist. I wish that this                wheel and stones continue to rotate by day and by night to                form  purest  flour  to  form  the  hosts  of  which  thousands  and                thousands of souls in San Pier Niceto, in the province, and in                Sicily are fed! Then the abundance of divine providence will                fill the earth and the punishment of the Lord will be averted                (Speech, Nov. 26, 1916).","13. UNWARRANTED CHARGE                         The people say that I shelter children too easily. They                do  not  know  the  moral  pressure  under  which  I  find  myself                more than often. Today it is an high ranking person pleading                for  a  child,  tomorrow  a  representative  of  the  public  press                interceding  for  another  child,  then  it  is  a  benefactor                .pretending to shelter an abandoned little girl. Ironically, the                same person who has criticized me for accepting children too                readily, is the one who will later insist that I take one that he                recommends. To refuse is embarrassing, for who can refuse                a bare-footed, sad-eyed child who seems to be saying to the                sister, « I have no mother, take me with you! »                         If I had taken the compasses as a cool administrator                from  the  time  I  began  sheltering  abandoned  children,  first  I                would not have bartered my little things; second, to balance                the  sheltering  of  the  poor  abandoned  orphans  with  the                meager contributions, I would not have formed the institutes.                Any enterprise requires initiative and impulse, but when the                matter  is  about  orphans  who  get  lost  day  after  day,  then   201                initiative and impulse are even more urgent. In Messina we                have two orphanages that shelter many children, giving them                an  education,  life,  and  safety;  instead  of  getting  lost,  these                children  found  their  right  path.  Why  should  I  extinguish  the                flame  or  instinct  that  drove  me  up  to  here?  For  a  cool,                inappropriate  calculation?  Besides,  I  somehow  restrained                myself;  to  the  persons  who  charge  me  with  sheltering  all                children that the people ask me for it I say that the charge is                false.  I  often  do  violence  to  myself  by  declining  to  shelter                children in order to avoid both going beyond my possibilities                and  jeopardizing  the  accepted  ones.  For  that  reason  I                sometimes  found  myself  at  variance  with  the  people  who                pressed on me to shelter children. Such persons were","the same who had charged me with receiving orphans with                impunity.                      As to how we are taking care of the orphans, ladies and                gentlemen, please come to check for yourselves. As a tutor, I                somehow know my duties. It is not only with the salvation of                souls and religious education that I am concerned, but I also                take great care of my orphaned children's bodily health and                civil education. Good nutrition, hygiene, cleanness, and good                manners  are  main  factors  of  the  educational  system  in  my                institutes.                      As for nutrition, please look at the children to see how                rubicund and healthy they are. As for hygiene, I pride myself                on the fact, for I follow the Kneip's system, I have read the                Mantegazza's  treatise,  and  keep  hygiene  seriously.  In  our                four refectories, we follow specific rules about moral, hygienic                precepts, and good manners in eating. (10)                      Our  institutes  are  provided  with  inside  water  facilities,                and children wash any time they need. The institute for girls   202                has a three tank laundry along with running water; there, the                laundresses wash, cleanse, and mend the clothes every day,                and  at  every  week-end  place  the  neat  clothes  on  each                person's bed. Both houses have rooms for wardrobes, where                clothes,  suits,  and  dresses  are  distinguished  by  personal                identification number.                      The  dormitories  are  wide  and  airy;  the  one far  girls  ,is                superlatively airy and sunny. Air and light are the main factors                of  life,  and  we  complain  that  too  many  people  ignore  this                important hygienic rule, which is so important. The 50 beds                dormitory at the Holy Spirit has 9 windows in the south, two in                the east, two in the north, 1 in the west, and is provided with                little venting windows at the bottom along with 6 air-holes on                the top. During the day, the windows are opened; in summer                time, they are","opened even in the night, when it is possible. Thanks to God,                the  prosperous  health  my  orphans  are  enjoying  depends                mainly on the observance of this hygienic rule: air, air, always                air,  fresh  air,  new  air,  pure  air  by  day  and  night,  in  the                dormitory, in the laboratory, in the school, during play-time, in                the refectory, and everywhere.                      We hold motion in great esteem. The boys are somehow                trained  like  soldiers;  they  walk  in  the  country  once  a  week,                and  enjoy  regular  play-time  every  day.  I  once  set  up                gymnastic  tools,  but  later  I  took  them  away  because  a  boy                ran a serious risk. We also have a little theater to entertain                and  educate  the  boys.  The  orphanage  for  girls  is  provided                with  wide  gardens,  where  children  play  and  rejoice  during                their recreation.                      Someone  says:  the  institute  for  boys  is  on  the  ground                floor,  and  the  dormitory  must  be  improved.  Ladies  and                gentlemen, can you spare me your money? Spare me it, and                I  assure  you  that  I  will  build  up  an  institute  model  in  short                time! I know very well which things my institutes need in order   203                to reach perfection; but, we have begun from nothing and I                dare to say that we have come a long way, thanks to God. I                also  have  other  ideals  and  I  am  going  straight  to  reach my                goals (Speech, Aug. 20, 1906) .                                   14. RECAPITULATION                      Saving tender children is a holiest work to which we will                attend with sacrifice, deeply aware of the excellent good we                do when we take them away from vagabondage, risks, and                depravity  and  provide  them  with  a  sound  education  and                environment. Thus, by God's help we form them to become                good  Christians,  perfect  Catholics,  honest  and  industrious                citizens as well as good parents when","they  marry.  We  will  keep  in  mind  that  educating  children                requires  continuous  sacrifices  and  self-denial  as  well  as  it                implies troubles, want, worries, and difficulties. Let us accept                everything willingly for the sake of our adorable Lord Jesus                Christ.                      To be successful in this holiest enterprise and to help the                children to succeed, we have:                      1. To edify them in everything and everywhere, keeping                in mind the divine teacher's threat: « If anyone should cause                one of these little ones to turn away from his faith in me, it                would be better... » (Mt. 18, 6).                      2.  To  pray  every  day  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  to                Immaculate  Mary  that  the  children  be  docile,  improve,  and                grow up with the fear of God.                      3. To help them receive the holy sacraments, especially                Holy  Communion  with  good  dispositions,  encouraging  them                to go to confession every week after a good examination of   204                conscience.                      4. To make them delight in pious practices, in well-timed                prayer, meditation, and holy rosary, sometimes allowing them                to share with us in order to win goad workers, etc. We have to                instill in their heart love for Jesus and Mary, devotion to St.                Joseph, the guardian angel, the patron saints, and St. Louis                Gonzaga,  whose  pious  union  Luigini  Sons  of  Immaculate                Mary must be taken in vigor. Let us also give them scapulars,                inscribing  them  to  confraternities  in  order  that  they  draw                spiritual goods for their success. Let them also attend mass                every day with recollection.                      5.  To  teach  them  catechism  every  day,  making  them                undergo the yearly examination and giving awards to the best                ones. It is also important to teach them good manners twice a                week.","6.  To  make  them  attend  the  elementary  school  along                with  regular  examination  with  a  pious,  Catholic,  upright                teacher. The best ones will be awarded a prize at the end of                the year.                      7. To make them improve in arts and crafts so that they                may earn their living honestly. The master trainers of art must                be  persons  of  good  morals;  but  they  have  no  complete                jurisdiction on children, who will be under our surveillance.                      8. To watch over children because it is a strict precept                and a duty of ours. Directors and assistants will keep a watch                on  them  in  the  church,  in  the  laboratories,  in  the  school,  in                play-time, and in the dormitories knowing that children have a                keen  instinct  to  escape  from  surveillance;  therefore  the                educator  must  be  smarter  than  they  are.  The  devil  seeks                depravity of children constantly, but the assistant must elude                Satan's snares by preserving the children who are entrusted                to him immaculate for the Lord!                      9.  To  love  children  with  pure,  holy  affection,  with  deep   205                understanding  of  charity,  tender,  fatherly  charity  in  God                because  this  is  the  secret  of  the  secrets  to  win  and  save                them. We have to deal with affection and meekness as well                as  with  reserve,  which  prevent  children  from  intimacy  and                ,confidence through reverential fear. Children must never be                insulted.  If  necessary,  punishment  must be given  in  such  a                way  that  children  know  it  is  for  their  good.  Children  must                never  be  reproached  for  private  faults  in  the  presence  of                others,  especially  the  little  ones  who  might  run  risks  of                scandal. In such a case, the warning or punishment must be                in private. The superior will never become vexed with children                nor show a grudge or lack of confidence against them. It is                better to conceal","some faults instead of disheartening or making children grow                weak.                      Punishment  or  strong  warnings  must be  avoided  when                they  may  provoke  reactions;  it  would  be  like  destroying  a                building.  Because  each  educator  needs  God's  enlight-                enments, he will ask them from the Lord and the  mother of                good counsel every day, even with tears and internal prayer                in  the  daily  occasions.  Educating  children  is  the  art  of arts,                the science of sciences, and only a few have it, because one                should be a philosopher and a theologian and a great expert                of the human heart and a saint to be a perfect educator of a                child.  As  for  us,  let  us  do  our  best  by  work  and  prayer  to                Jesus and Mary, imploring enlightenment about education of                children.                              15. TWO PHOTOGRAPHS (11)                      In my orphanage, children are taught to respect civic and                ecclesiastical  authorities  independently  from  principles  of   206                politics, which we do not mention in our teaching, only aiming                at forming honest citizens as well as good parents.                      To  understand  well  the  importance  of  such  a  humani-                tarian institution which everyone esteems, we don't need any                demonstration; to please you, however, I am going to show                an  eloquent  proof  that  speaks  by  itself:  two  photographs                which were shot in Taormina. Please listen to me. A 14 year                old  orphaned  girl  from  Taormina  worked  as  a  scullion  in                various houses to earn her living. Beaten and fired because                she  pilfered,  she  went  from  bad  to  worse  in  other  houses.                Dispersed,  ragged,  hair  topsy-turvy,  and  morally  upset  she                was  wearisome  to  herself  and  others,  having  no  hope  of  a                good  future.  One  day  she  was  drawing  water  at  a  fountain                when a foreigner passed","by, looked at her, and took a snapshot after letting her pose                as a characteristic girl.                      In  the  photo  she  appeared  like  an  African  savage                woman, barefoot and muddy, her hair topsy-turvy, the look on                her  face  troubled;  on  the  whole,  she  infused  a  feeling  of                horror  and  compassion,  because  she  was  an  orphan                abandoned to herself in the bloom of her youth. That photo                appeared in some post-cards of Taormina.                      Some days later, pious people asked me to shelter that                poor orphan; I received her along with her extreme poverty.                The youth was trained in education and vocational work, and                at  21  years  of  age  she  was  already  transformed:  no  one                could  recognize  her  as  the  girl  in  the  foreigner's  snapshot.                When  she  left  the  institute  to  be  hired by  a  noble  family  of                Taormina,  we  took a  photo.  What  a difference  between  the                first  photo  and  the  second  one!  The  latter  shows  the  good                education's  miraculous  effects!  The  photo  shows  a  neatly                dressed  serene  youth,  whose  look  transpires  the  gentle                dignity of a calm soul that is born again, that looks forward to   207                the  future  with  confident  trust.  She  is  handling  an  opened                book,  which  signifies  morals,  dignity,  and  culture.  Where  is                the African savage woman, whose gloomy look disheartened                and distressed? The African savage woman disappeared not                through  the  blizzards  of  life,  but  through  the  beneficial,                enlivening ray of the civil, moral, and intellectual education!                      Ladies and gentlemen, look at the two photos that were                shot  seven  years  ago.  See  the  difference  that  seven  years                and a half of education in my orphanage of Taormina have                made!  The  youth  is  Rosaria  Scimone.  This  youth  also                showed the education's strength by liberating herself from the                snares of which present society is full; by now, she lives in a                noble family at Acireale, where I","saw her the last time receiving good counseling by the refined                family, which is happy with her.                                         THE POOR                          1. LOVE AND RESPECT FOR THE POOR                      Let  us  promise  to  love  and  respect  the  poor,  seeking                their bodily and spiritual well-being. The superiors promise to                always  maintain  the  kitchen  soup  for  them,  giving  bread,                alms, and other things as we have done till now (Resolves,                June 17, 1920).                      The Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus will always open                the door to the poor of Jesus Christ to give them spiritual and                temporal  charity.  Even  though  the  order  has  no  asylums  or                shelters for the poor, still it must receive them in the atrium or                in a reserved room every day at lunch or dinner to give them                a dish of food with bread. At least every Sunday we should                gather,  evangelize,  and  teach  them  the  Christian  doctrine,   208                helping them receive Holy Communion. The most holy Heart                of  Jesus  will  be  greatly  delighted  if  we  encourage  them  to                attend mass every day receiving Holy Communion frequently.                Because  we  see  the  suffering  Jesus  in  the  most  poor  and                abject, we must treat them with particular affection applying                some discipline and a learning program. The most favorably                disposed and patient among the priests and the brothers will                be entrusted with this task. Both the orphans and the poor will                be  told  to  pray  every  day  to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy                Church, adhering to the pious union of the Poor of the Heart                of  Jesus,  which  will  be  approved  by  the  ecclesiastical                authority (C.R.).                      The Rogationists will remember that our pious institute is                born for the holy mission of giving; the more we","give, the more we will be given by the Lord because he said:                « (You) will receive a hundred times more, and will be given                eternal life » (Mt. 19, 29).                               2. A CHARGE CAUSING GRIEF                      Some persons charge me with helping the poor. To tell                the truth, this charge hurts me because helping the afflicted,                miserable, abandoned, dying by starvation and cold weather,                cripples, blind, and unable to work is a duty for all Christians,                even  'when  they  have  to  make  an  effort;  in  fact,  our  Lord                Jesus Christ taught us to do to others what we want be done                to  us.  They  say:  «  But  you  have  deprived  my  orphans  of                anything  in  order  to  help  care  of  the  orphans.  »  To  these                persons  I  answer:  «  Never  have  I  deprived  my  orphans  of                anything  in  order  to  help  the  poor,  because  I  obtained  the                means  from  public  charity  and  I  have  experienced  that  a                supreme providence, in whose presence both rich and poor                are equal, always provided me with the means to give a dish                of food and some bread to the most derelict and needy. »   209                      They respond that I help beggars who are able to work. I                say to them: « Please come to my institute at lunch time; »                you will see the pool of Siloe full of old feeble people, either                blind or cripples, or drooping by starvation. I assure you that I                held some of them who had fainted from starvation. If some                of them are unemployed, it is due to lack of work. Will society                condemn these to death because they lack work? Charity and                humaneness dare not, nor they deny them a piece of bread.                      These  persons  insist  that  some  of  the  poor  steal  and                cheat  me:  What  can  I  say?  It  is  possible  that  a  rascal                conceals himself under the guise of extreme poverty picking                up a dish of food and a piece of bread. What a great","thing! But, I cannot put into practice the saying, « so that the                guilty person may not be saved, the just must perish! » So I                cannot deny a piece of bread to so many unhappy persons                for fear that a rascal is concealed among them! They steal!                Please tell me, were you never robbed? Did human fraud and                simulation  never take money from  your  pocket  or  safe  box,                your vigilance and shrewdness notwithstanding?                      Perhaps  I  am  striking  a  discordant  note  that  revives                gloomy memories to you!... So I beg you not to charge me so                easily  if  a  beggar  who  is doubly  poor  happens  to  be  in  the                midst of so many unhappy people when I try to give a helping                hand. Society took no care of him when he was a little beggar                or rascal abandoning him to himself, so he took a wrong way.                Will society condemn him to  death today? At least, may he                find a gentle breeze of peace in the breath of celestial charity                which  is  able  to  get  him  back  to  a better  counsel  (Speech,                Aug. 20, 1906)!                         3. HELPING AND EVANGELIZING THE POOR               210                      Aware of the command and the exhortations of our Lord                Jesus Christ « give to everyone who asks you » and « give                the  remainder  to  the  poor  »  ,  the  pious  institute  of  the                Rogationists will be generous toward the poor, the afflicted,                and the derelict. The kitchen soup for the poor will never fail                in  each  institute,  and  after  providing  the  community  with                everything, a dish of food, some bread, and some money will                be given to all the spoor who knock at our door, taking into                consideration  their  age  and  ailments.  Helping  the  poor  this                way  or  giving  them  clothes  or  other  forms  of  charity,  after                providing  the  community  will  be  done  with  joy  because  the                apostle says: « God delights in the people who give with joy.                »","Alms  must  be  given  in  the  spirit  of  faith,  remembering                our Lard Jesus Christ's promise « you will receive a hundred                times more »  and « give to others, and God will give to you:                you will receive a full measure, a generous helping, -poured                into your hands - and all that you can hold. » On one hand,                we  have  to  provide  the  means  of  living  for  us  and  the                institutions;  on  the  other  hand,  we  have  to  keep  our  divine                Savior's saying « giving is better than receiving... »  Believing                in our Lord Jesus Christ's words will remind us that he said: «                Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do                unto me. »                      A  form  of  charity  we  must  have  at  heart,  performing  it                with kindness and sacred care, is hospitality. If the guests are                poor, we will provide them with everything without charging.                Let us remember St. Paul's saying: « Because of hospitality                Abraham  deserved  lodging  the  angels.  »  Each  house  will                have the guest rooms separated from the institute so that the                guests may have no relations with the community. (12) Some                brother or priest will take care of them.                                                                          211                     To  foster  the  practice  of  alms  and  charity  toward  our                neighbor  in  different  ways,  we  quote  the  touching  words  of                the Holy Spirit through the prophet Isaiah (58, 7-11)                      «... (Is not this the sort of fast that pleases me...) To let                the oppressed go free, and break every yoke, to share your                bread  with  the  hungry,  and  shelter  the  homeless  poor,  to                clothe the man you see to be naked, and not turn from your                own  kin?  Then  will  your  light  shine  like  the  dawn  and  your                wound  will  be  quickly  healed  over.  Your  integrity  will  go                before  you  and  the  glory  of  Yahweh  behind  you.  Cry,  and                Yahweh will answer; call, and he will say, \"I am here\". If you                do away with the yoke, the clenched fist, the wicked word, if                you give your bread","to the hungry, and relief to the oppressed, your light will rise                in  the  darkness,  and  your  shadows  become  like  noon.                Yahweh  will  always  guide  you,  giving  you  relief  in  desert                places. He will give strength to your bones and you shall be                like  a  watered  garden,  like  a  spring  of  water  whose  waters                never run dry. »                      But helping those who belong directly to the Lord such                as the priests and the religious communities in need pleases                God at the highest, attracting his best promises of retribution                and celestial blessings.                      We  cannot  help  being  touched  and  generous  toward                those  who  belong  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  completely                trusting in the prophet Malachi's divine promise: « Bring the                full tithes and dues to the storehouse so that there may be                food  in  my  house,  and  then  see  if  I  do  not  open  the  flood                gates  of  heaven  for  you  and  pour  out  blessing  for  you  in                abundance. For your sake I will lay a strict injunction on the                locust  not  to  destroy  the fruits  of  your  soil nor  to  make  the                vine  in  your  fields  barren,  says  Yahweh  Sabaoth.  All  the   212                nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delights,                says Yahweh Sabaoth » (Mal 3, 10...).                      Temporal charity must be combined with spiritual charity                because the poor need evangelization. Some of them do not                approach sacraments for many years either from laziness or                from ignorance of the Christian doctrine. At least on Sundays                and feasts, before giving food, we have to gather and teach                them the catechism, the I Believe, Our Father, and Hail Mary                making  there  pray  and  approach  the  sacraments  of                confession and Holy Communion. We have to bear in mind                that our Lord, as a sign that he was the divine messiah, to the                miracle of his omnipotence added the miracle of his mercy: «                The  poor  are  evangelized.  »  But  evangelizing  the  poor                without helping them","is an unfinished work. We must join both; by so doing, we will                do a good service pleasing the adorable heart of Jesus, who                will  reciprocate  by  giving  us  copious,  divine  blessings;                therefore,  this  double  charity  must  never  fail  (From  the                Appendix to our primal Constitutions).                                 4. WORKING PERSONNEL                      To  the  institute's  employees,  workers,  and  the  people                who are helped by it.                      Dear sirs:                      You  know  that  the  institute  to  which  you  belong  as                employees  or  workers  or  inmates  or  because  you  are                somehow  aided  has  no  property  nor  cash  funds  nor  sure                income  nor  fixed  profits,  but  lives  by  the  help  of  divine                providence.  You  also  know  that  I  have  many  orphans  to                maintain  in  two  institutes  as  well  as  many  duties  to  fulfill.                Given all this, we both are in great need of divine providence   213                to meet our interests.                      It is true that each one in his task, as myself in different                ways, works to help things along, but everything will come to                nothing without the help of divine providence, because God                keeps  an  eye  on  the  human  fortunes  ruling  and  directing                them according  to  his  supreme  will.  He makes  the  sun  rise                and  the  earth  bloom,  gives  rain  and  provides  all  creatures                with  things.  But  if  we  forget  God,  God  will  forget  us,  and                despite  our  working,  toiling  around,  providence  will  not  or                hardly come.                      This is why I feel myself obliged to ask you to observe                the  religious  duties  as  well  as  any other  Christian  duty.  On                one hand, you want me to give work to you, paying you for it;                on the other hand, I ask you not to hinder divine providence                by forgetting God, because if He does","not give me the means, I am unable to pay and reward you                according  to  your  need  or  work;  if  you  do  not  comply  with                your  duties  toward  Gad,  with  good  reason  I  have  fear  of                losing His means. This is my interest and yours.                      Besides, your religious duties are not intolerable burdens                nor do I require of you great sacrifice, but religious acts that                are  very  easy.  My  dearest  in  Jesus  Christ, please  consider                that  we  are  unable  to  stay  in  the  grace  of  God,  unless  we                fulfill our religious duties.                      Living  without  confession,  Holy  Communion,  and  study                of the main elements of our holy religion, living without lifting                up  our  eyes  to  heaven  to  pray  and  adore  God  as our  Lord                and Creator, living without considering our last end as well as                the eternal destination, this is not a Christian living, a living of                God's creatures, but a living of ungrateful beings, of fools who                run the risk of getting lost for ever. By forgetting God and our                religious  duties  it  becomes  unavoidable  for  us  to  fall  into                many sins!                                                                          214                     This  is  both  the  rub  of  my  worries  and  our  common                prejudice!  My  dearest,  I  assure  you  that  I fear  nothing,  and                nothing disheartens me in the proceeding of these charitable                institutes,  but  sin.  Want,  difficulties,  persecutions,  etc.                everything  seems  like  nothing,  because  I  hope  and  trust  in                the  Lord,  who  is  a  provident  and  loving  father.  But,  if  sin                dwells among the people who live in the institutes, then I see                everything lost!                      My  dearest  brothers  and  sisters,  such  a  truth  the  Holy                Spirit  manifested  in  these  words:  «  Virtue  makes  a  nation                great, by sin whole races are disgraced » (Prov. 14, 34). Do                you know why misery is reigning in the families, the families                are fading, means are flailing, bankruptcies are common, and                misfortunes  are  increasing?  Because  of  sin!  On  one  hand,                the  people  live  far  off  from  God,  disregarding  the  religious                duties and adhering","to nothing but interest; on the other hand, God does not bless                their business, industries, fields, and work; on one hand, we                make plans, on the other hand, Gad makes them useless; we                collect money, but God makes it disappear with no profit. In                short, without the blessing of God, nothing goes on well; with                the blessing of God, everything flourishes.                      God  does  not  bless  the  people  who  disregard  the                religious  duties  such  as  confession,  Holy  Communion,                preaching, religious education, spiritual reading, and prayer in                the morning and night. The persons who live oblivious of God                are too feeble to overcome temptations, internal and external                sins,  bad  thoughts,  bad  words,  and  bad  actions  reaching                such  a  degree  as  to  even  justify  their  sins  by  calling                themselves the best Christians.                      But I think otherwise. I do not tike such people to share                in my institutes, because such a sharing is to the prejudice of                both  of  us.  One  Jonah  was more  than  enough  in  a  ship  to                make  a  storm  rise,  threatening  the  ship  with  sinking.  Only                when Jonah was thrown overboard did the storm die down. If   215                I permit the sharing in my institute by the people who have no                fear  of  God,  who  disregard  the  religious  duties,  mho  are                defiled by transgressions of divine law I have good reason to                fear that God and divine providence will cut the help, letting                the storm sink us. But I am determined to expel the Jonahs                for our common interest. To save the others, I have to cut the                corrupted  member  who  attracts  divine  punishments.  If  I  do                not behave this way, I will render an account to the Lord, who                will punish me.                      My dearest brothers and sisters:                      Even though I am an unworthy minister of the Lord, I feel                confident  that  you  will  receive  my  words  as  a  beneficial                warning from our Lord Jesus Christ, who wants to","drive you on a better way of living. Your being observant of                the Christian law attracts the divine blessings on you during                this life, making you worthy of eternal salvation. (13)                                            NOTES                     (1)   This  is the aim of education:  «It is of  greatest importance not                to be  mistaken  both  in  education  and  in  the  direction  toward the                last end,  because  education  and   last  end   are  intimately   con-                nected. In fact, since education consists in forming the human being as it                must be and behave in this terrestrial life in order to reach its last end for                which  it  was    created,  it  is  obvious...  that  we  have  no  true  education                when it does not aim  at the last end  (Pious XI, Encyclical  Divini illius                Magistri, Deo. 31,  1929).                     (2)  Keep in mind that our padre was writing when liberalism was                reigning.   The   state  considered   itself   free   from   any   superior                law, either divine or natural, and the individual  gloried in feeling himself                free from the Church, revelation, God, and from the state... Invoking the                name  of  God    in  the  school  or    in    public  offices   made    people  risk                various trouble,  immediate dismissal from  work  included.   216                     (3)   Our   padre   also   recommends   the   orphans   to   join                various  pious  unions:    «You  know  that  all  of  us  are  associated  with                several pious unions to profit  by their spiritual goods. You  also  know                that every 6 months the new orphans are informed and told to associate                the  pious  unions;  their  names  are  to  be  registered  in  the house  book                before  communicating  the  list  to  the   directors'  offices  for  getting                the  membership  card.  We  like  to   know   if  that  has  been   regularly                made and exhort you to never neglect it. Remember that we usually give                an   offering   for  the   membership   cards   and   something   more                when figures or medals are mailed to us.                    We  insist  on  the  yearly  practice  of  the  sacred  slavery,  on  the                registration  at  Queen  of  Hearts  in  Rome,  and  the  tribute  to  be  sent.                About the orphanages we point out that the female orphans will not be                registered  nor  will say the  formula  of consecration, unless  they  are  at                least 15 years old as well as instructed at least for a couple of years»                (Circular, Jan. 1925).                     (4)   First of all, the sisters will give good examples to the girls in                speech,   love   for   work,   religious   practices,   obedience,   mutual","respect,  etc.  avoiding  intlmaoy  and  confidence  with  them.  Woe  if                they induced the girls to speak ill or refer or exchange mutual gifts or                give  secret  messages.  By  doing  so  they  would  lose  their  own  dignity                ruining  the  girls.  To  make  themselves  respected,  the  sisters  will  be                reserved  and  decorous,  humble  and  polite,  avoiding  particular                preferences. They will only give preference to merit. Wisdom knows how                to combine dignity and decorum with humility and courtesy» (Rules for                the sisters running the orphanages.                    The  novice  overseer  will  be  always  vigilant  over  children  without                getting tired or straying or being bored; she will keep watch so that none                of  them  be  at  fault  with  discipline.  To  train  the  children  to  be  docile,                obedient, and disciplined the sister will give good example: she will arm                herself with patience, meekness, and charity talking almost always with                gentle, mild voice, because such a behavior keeps children quiet more                than any invective or hard reprehension. But the most effective means to                make  children  docile  and  obedient  is  praying  to  God  for  them  and                making  them  pray  for  the  same  purpose.  A  mild  educator  makes  the                pupils mild. The sister will beware both of saying words of contempt to                children and of beating them because she becomes bored watching over                them (R. L. P.).                    The  Little  Retreat  novices  will  consider  themselves  like  maid-                servants of the girls and the poor, especially of those who belong to the                pious  institute.  For  God's  glory,  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'                consolation,  and  the  souls'  sanctification  the  novices  will  give  good   217                example  to  children,  edifying  in  everything  through  the  exercise  of                virtues, especially humility, obedience, patience, meekness, discipline as                well as through a modest, contrite' appearance, and recollection during                the prayer and the holy mass.                    If  a  novice  is  offended  or  scorned  by  children,  she  will  show  no                personal resentment, but will be patient and meek in order to edify them.                Only when charity urges to refer the matter to the mother superior the                novice  will  do  so  for  the  good  of  children,  but  without  a  feeling  of                revenge or of personal satisfaction* (R. L. P.).                     (5) « Children follow the educator's pattern; their behavior depends                on  the  educator's  behavior;  therefore,  the  prefect  of  the  boys  will  be                flawless in morals and religion making it appear in his actions, gestures,                words as well as in his way of acting, talking, and thinking.                    As to appearance, he will be somehow serious and lovable among                the boys to make himself loved and feared. To keep them subject, he                will be strong, but without showing pride or arrogance or anger; he will                not  insult,  beat,  illtreat  them,  on  the  contrary  he  will  show  that  he  is                warmly  interested  in  their  good,  and  the  boys  will  be  charmed  by                perceiving and understanding it. This is the education's real secret!                    When the educator is really interested in the pupils' good he loves","them in a holy manner, and is concerned with their future. If they do                not succeed, he can be strong enough to punish them when they are at                fault, and  the  pupils  will never  feel  offended,  on  the  contrary  they  will                love and fear their educator.                    To succeed in everything, the prefect will pray to the Lord for help                and enlightenment every day, because educating the youths is the art of                the  arts  and  no  one  can  succed  in  it  without  the  Lord's  help  and                enlightenment! He will also pray to the Lord and Our Lady every day so                that his pupils may succeed and save their souls» (R. P. A.).                    (6)   «A formula  of  this  prayer directed  to  the  most  holy  Im-                maculate  Mary,  to  whom  our  orphanages  are  dedicated    since    their                origin, is preserved in our orphanage.»                    (7)     «  To  perfectly  fulfill his duty,  the  prefect will  watch  over  the                boys  with  careful  attention.                    Surveillance consists in keeping guard on their actions during work,                prayer, and especially in play-time because it is then that the boys try to                escape  his  supervision.  When  the  boys  are  playing,  he  will  not  be                carefree, but will supervise from a place whence he is able to see all of                them; if they are walking, he will be in their midst hearing their talk even                though  they  speak  in  a  low  voice.  While  playing,  he  will  let  them  cry                aloud and jump at their liking, but without laying hands on each other or                beating or insulting the fellows or damaging the community's things or                damaging their clothes by falling down on the ground.                    During work time, he will watch over in the factories seeing that the   218                boys are not idle, do not gossip, nor play nor struggle against the boss.                    Also in the Church he will be most diligent, helping the boys enter                composed  and  recollected.  To  be  of  help,  he  will  stop  them  at  the                church's entrance till they are calm and silent; then he will lead them,                recollected  and  reverent,  will  sign  himself  with  the  holy  water,  and                genuflect in the middle of the aisle, teaching  the boys to do the same                while going to their place; the vice prefect will enter last. The prefect will                also see to it that the boys sit down or kneel at the proper time as well as                follow the liturgy, composed and silent, answering the prayer all together                with a moderate voice.                    In  the  refectory,  he  will  demand  of  the  boys  fine  manners  and                observance of silence.                    Personal  attention  will  be  given  to  each  boy  that  he  be  provided                with clothes and footwear every week and bed sheets every other week.                The prefect will see to it that the boys take care of their clothes, having                them  repaired  as  soon  as  possible,  and  that  they  observe  bodily                neatness in the hands, face, neck, ears. If necessary, he will have the                boys wash themselves in his presence.","The boys are not allowed to do anything without permission nor to                go to the parlor to talk with external persons nor to act as door keepers.                While giving permissions the prefect will pay careful attention to prevent                two boys from meeting alone far from surveillance. He must be careful                because  boys  are  skilled  in  asking  permission  which  gives  them  the                chance to meet alone » (R. P. A.).                    Following the institute's character, system, and spirit the prefect will                moralize the boys through appropriate instructions and exhortations. He                will  beware  of  introducing  talks,  examples,  and  maxims  that  stimulate                selfishness  or  wordliness  or  somehow  excite  pride,  vainglory,  and                curiosity. His tales will be always most honest, innocent, and religious »                (R. P. A.).                    (8)   Keep in  mind that our padre was writing in  1880, when the                institute's conditions allowed  that only.  Besides,  in  those times,  an                elementary graduate worker was an exception.                    (9)  Due to this certainty,  Messina archepiscopal chancery  office                ordered all the priests  to buy  the hosts and  the wafers from  our female                community at the  Holy Spirit.                    Our padre wrote: through the bakery, our orphanage has another                qualification in the city.

Hygienic precepts: 1) Eat slowly, and chew well the food. 2) Do not                eat too hot food because it ruins our teeth and our digestion.                    3)   Do not drink cold  beverage  soon   after eating  because   it                ruins our digestion and our teeth.                    Fine  manners  precepts:  1)  Eat  what  you  are  given  without                complaining, and get used to eating any food. 2) Eat with fine manners                and  take  your  time.  3)  Do  not  dirty  your  hands,  your  face,  and  your                napkin.                    4)   Do not rest your elbows on the table. 5)   Eat in  silence without                making   noise.                    (11)   The city hall  of Taormina  had  leased  the   building  to  the                orphanage  for  600  liras  a  year.  More  than  once  the  anticlerical  bias                threatened the orphans with expulsion. In March 1914, the city council                administration  seemed  to  be  about  to  give  the  deadly  blow,  and  our                padre published an open letter through the press addressing the mayor                along with his council to defend the orphanage's rights. The Scimone's                episode is taken from that letter.","(12)      The  precious virtue of  hospitality, which    is so  dear  to  the                Heart of Jesus as well  as delicious  and  consoling  for  those   who                practice it with faith and charity,  will  be practiced with  great love when                it  is  possible.  The  external    persons,    however,    will    not  enter  the                community  because  it  could  start  slackening   (Resolves,   June 17,                1920).                    (13)   Our padre combined  some rules of Christian  life with  the                considerations we have quoted above for the service personnel.                                                                                            220","CHAPTER VI                                EVANGELICAL ROGATION                      I  declare  that  the  precepts  of  charity  will  form  the                goal of my religious life in this  institute, and to reach it                under the guide of holy obedience I will not spare myself                in working hard for the spiritual and temporal good of my                neighbor. To expand this charity to everyone as much as                I  can,  I  will  aim  at  reaching  the  greatest,  universal,                spiritual,  and  temporal  good  of  my  present  and  future                neighbor  through  the  most  effective  means  of  the  «                Evangelical Rogation of the Heart of Jesus», which forms                the  institute's  special  mission.  To  reach  this  goal  I  will                present my petitions to God in the mass, the prayer, the                Holy, Communion, the visits to the Holy Sacrament, and                the rosary, exhorting my brethren and the children who                attend the catechism classes to do the same.                                                                            221                                  1. ZEAL AND ROGATE                      The  spirit  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation  of  Jesus'  Heart,                which was given us by divine goodness must be kept always                alive and fervid and must be spread through all the means at                our disposal. (Resolves, June 17, 1920).                      The  divine  mission  of  obeying  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's                Rogate  is  entrusted  to  this  institute's  sisters  who  bear  its                words printed on their chest: « Pray, therefore,... » They will                take the vow of praying every day to the Lord that he send                out  new  apostles  to  the  holy  Church, true ministers  of  God                and  the  most  holy  Virgin,  who  preach  zealously  Jesus                Christ's gospel in its purity all over the","world along with morals, penance and observance of God's                law,  necessity  of  prayer,  detachment  from  earthly  matters,                death,  paradise,  hell;  as  well  as  life,  Passion,  death,  and                resurrection  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  strengthening  the                people  in  their  faith  so  that  the  enemy  may  not  prey  upon                their souls. These holy vocations, these true ministers of the                Church,  these  good  workers  of  the  mystical  harvest,  and                these new apostles will form the particular object of the active                and contemplative fife of this pious institute's sisters. So that                this  prayer may  have better  results, the  sisters  will  do  their                best  to  spread  it  among  the  people,  the  inmates  of  the                institute,  and  other  persons  praying  to  the  Lord  that  he                himself  will  expand  the  spirit  of  this  prayer  (Rules,  Oct.  6,                1897).                      Zeal is the virtue that seek divine glory and sanctification                of souls. Due to human failings, no one is able to encompass                all the objects of a virtue at the same time, but we are obliged                to apply the virtue to particular objects in order to practice it.                In our case, which is the best object for the zeal of the Poor of                the  Holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  who  take  the  vow  to  foster  divine   222                glory and salvation of souls? The object will be: winning good                workers to the holy Church through prayer and cooperation.                This object summarizes the best of everything to foster divine                glory and salvation of souls. The reason is that the power and                the  mission  of  glorifying  God  and  saving  souls  has  been                entrusted  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  to  the  good  evangelical                workers, who are the priests. He said to the apostles: « As                the Father has sent me, so I send you. » Now, our Lord Jesus                Christ's mission and his redemption aim at the Father's glory                and our salvation, which form the mission and the aim of the                Church's  ministers.  To  fulfill  this  mission,  God  endows  His                priests with a particular power and grace: When they","answer the Lord's call faithfully, no one is able to value the                glory they give to God and the good they cause to souls. Who                may  value  the  beneficial  effects  of  one  faithful  priest's                ministry?  These  mysteries  of  grace  will  be  valued  at  the                judgment  day only.  Considering  haw  much glory  one  divine                mass gives to God and how much good it causes to so many                souls  is  enough  to  somehow  understand  the  importance  of                one  priest  who  says  mass  every  day.  If  we  consider  the                whole ministry of a priest, we may conclude that a good priest                is a glorifier of the Lord and a savior of souls: it is like Jesus                Christ himself who gives the eternal Father what is due to His                divine love by saving souls from eternal death!                      Hence  we  realize  that  the  best,  surest,  and  easiest                means to seek God's glory and salvation of souls is winning                good priests to the holy Church, because this ins the shortest,                surest way to reach God's glory and salvation of souls, which                is the goal of the people who are enflamed by zeal (C.P.).                            2. ROGATE AND OUR INSTITUTIONS                  223                      I was still a deacon when I entered the Avignone Quarter                for the first time, 22 years ago; (1) this quarter was the city's                infamy, and it impressed me a great deal with its great misery                and  abandon.  Those  unhappy  persons  were  living  like                animals: all marriages were illegal, children were immersed in                mud, and were exposed to immorality, and old people died on                the  bare,  wet  ground  of  the  slums.  lt  reminded  me  of  the                words of the gospel: « As he saw the crowds, his heart was                filled  with  pity  for  them,  because  they  were  worried  and                helpless,  like  sheep  without  a  shepherd.  So  he  said  to  his                disciples, \"There is","a large harvest, but few workers to gather it in... Pray to the                owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in                his harvest\" » (Mt. 9, 36-38).                      Ever since I engaged myself to relieve those abandoned                persons spiritually and materially as much as I could. To keep                the  young  girls  safe,  a  loom  was  installed  in  one  slum  to                teach them to work; it was the first seed of the orphanage for                girls.  Later,  we  began  gathering  the  boy  beggars  in  a  few                small rented houses thus starting the orphanage for boys. But                the word of the gospel: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the                harvest that he will send out workers to gather in His harvest                »,  'was  predominant  in  my  thoughts  since  the  beginning  of                this pious institute.                      I thought: what is the meaning of the few orphans who                are saved, the few poor who are evangelized, compared with                the  millions  and  millions  of  people  who  get  lost  and  are                abandoned  like  sheep  without  a  shepherd?  I  looked  at  my                ,poor  means,  at  the  smallest  sphere  of  my  activity,  and                sought for a solution. I found a wide, unlimited outlet in the   224                adorable words of our Lord Jesus Christ: « Pray, therefore, to                the  owner  of  the  harvest  that,  he  will  send  out  workers  to                gather in his harvest. »  I seemed to have found the secret of                all good works and of the salvation of all souls.                      Through this predominant idea, I considered this institute                not simply as a charitable institution aiming at saving some                orphans and poor, but aiming at a greater and wider goal: the                divine  glory,  salvation  of  souls,  and  the  good  of  the  whole                Church. Both the aim of picking up from the most holy mouth                of  Jesus  Christ  the  command  of  his  divine  Heart:  «  Pray,                therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that he  will  send  out                workers to gather in his harvest »  and the zeal for fulfilling it                in the best way","for the greater consolation of the Heart of Jesus form the goal                of this institute.                      Truly, the spirit of God blows wherever it wishes (Jn. 3,                8);  he  chose  what  the  world  looks  down  on,  and  despises,                and thinks is nothing, in order to destroy what the world thinks                is  important.  This  means  that  no  one  can  boast  in  God's                presence (Cot. 1, 28-29)!                      Divine  mercy  who  sees  the  sky  and  earth  (Ps.  113,6)                liked to entrust this pious institute of poor and orphans with                this  great  treasure,  a  precious  seed,  a  grain  of  mustard,                which may spread all over the Church witch the blessing of                the Lord. Thus, the Lord liked to make the children and the                youths,  the  orphans  and  the  poor  of  this  pious  institute                understand  the  importance  of  this  divine  words:  «  Pray,                therefore, etc. »                      The spirit of this prayer became quickly the spirit of this                pious  institute  and  formed  its  character,  its  aim,  and  its                practice.                                                 225                      It  was  the  turn  of  the  two  little  religious  communities                leading  the  male  and  the  female  orphanages  to  become                masters of this sacred patrimony of the Pious Institute of the                Poor of the Heart of Jesus, to be trustees and guardians, to                form  the  center  of  this  important  religious  practice,  and  to                become propagators of it. As in any charitable institution, the                inmates  who  succeed  each  other  form  the  object,  not  the                institute;  the  institute  instead,  resides  in  those  who  are                committed  to  the  mission,  who  are  united  by  the  bond  of                religious profession through a name, a rule, anal the sacred                garb.                      In this pious institute, the two little religious orders take                the vow to pray every day in order to win the good workers to                the holy Church in obedience to the most holy Heart of Jesus'                command.  Both  Rogationists  and  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal                wear on their chest the sacred red","emblem  of  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  along  with  the                gospel's words: « Pray, therefore,... » (2)                      In fact, that the two orders are concerned with works of                charity and beneficence derives legitimately and immediately                from the mission of the vocation prayer: in fact, if they pray                continuously  to  win  the  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church,  if                they follow the wish of the most holy Heart of Jesus through                his divine command, much greater is the reason they have to                strive to be good workers themselves. The fulfillment of the                fourth vow not only engages them to this continuous prayer,                but  also  binds  them  to  spread  its  spirit  everywhere,  which                they do by educating orphans and evangelizing the poor, by                teaching  them  that  the  most  desirable  grace  is  to  obey  the                command of the most holy Heart of Jesus through the prac-                tice  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation  (Preface  to  Precious                Adhesions, 1903).                                   3. HARD ENTERPRISE                                                                          226                     Fights  were  pressing  on  every  side,  the  pious  institute                was  on  the  verge  of  collapse  many  times.  It  seemed  to  be                dying, but it did not. Encouraging help intervened to keep it                alive  and  subsistent,  to  test  it  over  and  over  again,  and  to                make it savor new unexpected pains.                      The  pious  institute  endured  hardships  for  about  20                years,  in  spite  of  having  won  many  souls  to  goodness,  of                having  delivered  many  children  from  depravity,  of  having                evangelized and helped many poor. Despite the fact that the                inmates had been praying and presenting petitions every day,                sometimes even by night; that elect persons had joined the                two  orders  remedying  the  starter's  failings  (3)  and  that  we                were  preparing  a  better  future,  the  future  was  still  nothing                else but a myth, a dream, a","hope.  The  present  time  was  always  more  difficult,  more                entangled, more disheartening.                      Lo and behold! A resource-idea flashed across the priest                starter's mind.  This  idea  was  a  child  of a  great  word  of  the                gospel, a child of a greater, sublime idea, that the Spirit, who                blows wherever he wishes, instilled into the soul of a spiritual                youth  many  years  before  the  pious  institute's  birth.  This                evangelical  revelation,  this  divine  idea,  -  abating  it  is  not                humility - preceded and escorted the poor priest starter in his                hard  enterprise.  This  idea  became  the  pious  institute's                foundation, as the key that opened some treasure of divine                mercies  and  the  secret  of  the  divine  favors  we  desired  so                much. Let us declare this great word of the Gospel, this great                command.                      The  evangelists  St.  Matthew  and  St.  Luke  report  this                divine  command  of  Jesus'  Heart's  divine  zeal;  St.  Matthew                says: « There is a large harvest, but few workers to gather it                in. Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send workers                to gather in his harvest » (Mt. 9, 37-38). St. Luke says: « He   227                said  to  them,  there  is  a  large  harvest,  but  few  workers  to                gather it in. Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send                out workers to gather in his harvest » (Lk. 10, 2).                      A mean paid a special attention to this divine command                making his debut with it in his carrier (4) even before he had                read it in the gospel.                      The priest who knew this divine secret started the pious                institute in that enclosure of slums, in that corner of Messing                we  mentioned  above,  giving  the  pious  enterprise  the  chief                program of practicing perfectly the divine command of Jesus'                Heart's  divine  zeal,  «  Pray,  therefore...  »    He  gave  those                abandoned  poor,  who  really  formed  a  flock  without  a                shepherd,  the  rule  to  pray  in  common  to  the  owner  of  the                harvest.","Listening to the tender voice of those children of the poor                praying the Evangelical Rogation to win good workers to the                holy  Church  was  wonderful;  from  that  pitiable  place  the                prayer raised to heaven, up to the throne of the One who <                sees  the  sky  and  earth  »  (Ps.  113,  6)  and  «  listens  to  the                wants of the humble » (Ps. 10, 17).                      While  that  common  folk  was  catechized  sand  children                were  educated  and  trained  in  arts  and  crafts,  the  prayer  to                win  favors  from  the  adorable  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary                ascended  to  heaven.  We  taught  the  children  saying:  «  My                dear, we have gathered you for your salvation, but you see                how many obstacles hinder 'both formation and steadiness of                these institutions; we, however, have to trust, to serve God, to                love  Jesus,  and  to  pray  because  we  will  obtain  everything                through humble, confident, and perseverant prayer. »  As a                matter of fact, prayer was the nascent institution's continuous                breath.  Sometimes  we  prayed  even  in  the  night,  keeping                vigils.                      We strove to make the people hold the mass in esteem,   228                teaching them that through the offering of the mass we might                obtain  any  grace,  because  when  the  divine  victim  is                immolated  on  the  altar,  the  heavens  unfold  pouring  graces                down.                      A person once said: « God's blessings do not yet come                down  on  this  institute!  »  That  person  meant:  «  God's                blessings  do  not  yet  come  to  fecundate  and  foster  this                institute. » From that time the priest starter began longing for                the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'  fecundating  blessings  like                Jacob did for his father's blessings.                      Holy  mass  and  blessings!  Oh!  Who  will  offer  the  holy                mass so worthily to win all the divine blessings for this pious                institute?  Is  this  institute  going  to  die?  Besides  attending  to                the salvation of souls, this institute is perhaps the only one in                the holy Church that fulfills and","makes people fulfill the divine command: « Pray, therefore. .                » On this ground we could not help trusting in the most holy                Heart of Jesus for safety.                      These were the starter's wails and sighs, and to reach                safety  we  offered  the  daily  mass'  intention  for  such  a                purpose, declining the offering for other intentions.                                 4. THE RESOURCE-IDEA                      I  have  said  that  a  happy  resource-idea  flashed  across                the mind of the pious institute's starter; this idea was a child                of the evangelical rogation, that is to say, child of the spirit of                the daily prayer or rogation to win good workers to the holy                Church.                      Blessed  by  God,  the  happy  resource-idea  was  born  of                that priest's following reasoning: the bishops are the persons                more concerned with the divine words « pray, therefore... »                because they first need priests sent by God through the Holy   229                Spirit,  they  are  responsible  for  the  seminaries,  they  are                greatly  concerned  with  the  seminarians'  becoming  holy                priests, but they cannot achieve this goal without the prayer                ordered by Jesus; their means, labor, schools, and industries                notwithstanding.                      Consequently,  the  bishops  cannot  help  taking  at  heart                this pious institute: They cannot deny me a favor when I ask                them for it. Which favor? A financial help? Never. The Lord's                works are not founded on money, but on the contempt of it.                Then,  what  will  I  ask  the  prelates  of  the  holy  Church,  the                successors  to  the  holy  apostles?  What  does  a  foundation                need  to  grow  and  develop  for  the  Lord's  glory  and  the                salvation  of  souls?  Are  there  any  additional  needs  besides                divine  grace  and  blessings?  Well,  now,  I  will  resort  to  the                sacred  prelates  of  the  Church  unfurling  before  them  the                glorious banner of the","Evangelical  Rogation,  which  I  have  not  erected  on  highest                towers,  but  on  the  slums  of  the  poor.  While  kneeling,  I  will                entreat them to give a pure, spiritual contribution of prayers                and blessings during the most solemn act of our holy religion,                during the great sacrifice of the mass. (5)                      Hardly had I conceived this idea that I put it to work by                mailing  a  printed  letter  to  the  bishops  of  Sicily,  then  to  the                bishops of Italy, to the cardinals, and to the superiors general                of the religious orders. They were told of this pious institute's                existence having two aims, the primary one at complying with                the divine command of the sacred Heart of Jesus' divine zeal,                «  pray  therefore,  »  and  the  other  one  aiming  at  various                charitable purposes.                      The  Church's  prelates  were  also  told  that  the  nascent                foundation  was  on  the  verge  of  death  and  in  need  of  their                help.  They  were  specifically  entreated  to  become  spiritual                benefactors  of  the  foundation  for  the  sake  of  the  divine                command, because the foundation had taken this command                from our divine Savior's mouth lighting a hearth that should   230                grow with sacred flames of fervent zeal for the Sacred Heart                of  Jesus'  interests.  The  Church's  sacred  prelates  were                entreated  to  give  the  following  four  spiritual  favors  to  the                nascent institute:                      1. Once a year and under no obligation of conscience, to                apply the special fruit of one mass for the spiritual benefit of                the foundation, that is to say, for its growth in the Lord.                      2 Every day, at least through a habitual intention, to offer                this pious institute along with its members, labor, and hopes                to  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  during  the  elevation  of  the                ghost.                      3. Both at the end of the mass and in other occasions","while blessing the faithful, to have a mind to bless the pious                institute along with its members as if they were present and                kneeling around them.                      4.  To  join  their  intention  to  the  intention  of  the  pious                institute's members, who pray every day to win holy priests of                the Lord from divine mercy.                      SPIRITUAL RETURNS: after asking the  above spiritual                favors,  the  pious  institute  promised  to  return  the  following                ones:                      1. Monthly masses for the spiritual benefactors, who are                either alive or dead.                      2.  A  daily  sprayer  by  the  institute's  orphans,  poor,                priests, brothers, and sisters for each of the sacred prelates                and for their intentions.                      3. While praying to win good workers to the Church, the                component of the pious institute will apply a special intention   231                in  favor  of  the  dioceses and  the  seminaries  whose  bishops                have granted the four spiritual favors.                      4.  At  the  nevus  of  each  sacred  ally's  death,  the  pious                institute  will  offer  a  mass  and  a  triduo  of  prayer,  Holy                Communion,  and  the  rosary  for  the  repose  of  the  spiritual                benefactor's soul.                   5. SACRED ALLIANCE OF PRIESTS FOR VOCATIONS (6)                      After mailing this petition to the Church's prelates in the                name  of  Jesus,  we  received  some  adhesion  letters  so                expressive  as  to  surpass  any  expectation.  Through  its  high                representatives, the Church seemed to give a helping hand in                order to sustain the nascent foundation, pushing it forward in                the field of the Evangelical Rogation","for  its  complete  shaping.  To  the  senders'  great  satisfaction                the  four  spiritual  favors  were  granted  enthusiastically;  the                Italian  bishops'  letters  announcing  their  adhesion  are  most                precious  and  they  are  the  most  delicate  documents  of  the                pious institute's archive.                      At  each  arrival  of  precious  adhesions,  we  rang  the                oratory's  bells  to  give  thanks  to  our  Lord  and  to  the  Virgin                Mary. If some children were under a punishment, they were                relieved  from  it  because  that  day  was  a  feast  for  all.  It  is                praiseworthy  remembering  that  the  spiritual  benefactors                chose the best dates either of their life or of the ecclesiastical                year  for  the  celebration  of  the  yearly  mass.  Among  the                cardinals, Card. Oreglia, dean of the Sacred College, was the                first to adhere.                      The  highly  beneficial  effects  on  this  least  grain,  which                followed the spreading of so many spiritual favors of the holy                Church were such that the idea of invoking the supreme help                of prayers and blessing on this pious institute along with its                components  is  considered  not  a  simple  idea,  but  a  true   232                inspiration from heaven.                      Everything  began  blooming,  the  doors  of  divine  prov-                idence  were  opened,  and  the  vocations  to  the  two  orders                increased.  Even  the  1908  earthquake,  which  destroyed                Messina,  put  forward  the  pious  institute  in  the  Italian                continent, where it flourished with various important houses.                      We  were  given  St.  Anthony  of  Padua  as  our  most                special,  prodigious  protector,  and  his  continuous  favors                compelled  us  to  publish  a  monthly  periodical  for  Italy,                America, and other foreign countries' benefactors. Thus, the                humble, nascent, little institute came to the knowledge of the                people  in  Italy  and  elsewhere.  The  spiritual  help  from  the                ecclesiastical authorities' prayers and blessings is still visible.                To have such an admirable spiritual","treasure unimpaired and increased, we feel drawn to use all                means at our disposal.                      Kneeling before the bishops all over the world, who are                the  illustrious,  sacred  successors  to  the  apostles,  the                humblest components of this pious institute of the interests of                Jesus' Heart implore the four spiritual favors that sustain and                keep the pious institute alive since it leans on this priceless                treasure, not an gold, purest gold (Ps. 119, 127). This most                particular  favor  the  pious  institute's  components  ask  for  the                sake of the loving Heart of Jesus and for the sacred word «                pray, therefore,... » etc., which shines on the forehead of the                holy Church’s least daughters.                      So  many  sacred  allies  who are  spiritually  united  in  the                daily prayer to win good workers to the holy Church will make                this continuous Rogation effective by obtaining from the most                holy Heart of Jesus the ministers the holy Church desires and                needs. The continuous blessings will make heaven pour out                favors on us; the hearth lighting the fire of the Rogation, lying                down  almost  unknown  in  the  holy  gospels,  will  never  fail;   233                rather,  it  will  increase  for  the  good  of  the  holy  Church,  for                society, and for you, in whose benefit we return acceptable                spiritual favors.                      Owing  to  so  many  innocent  souls  and  poor  of  Jesus                Christ as well as to the virgins who pray continuously to the                Hearts of Jesus and Mary, St. Joseph, and the holy apostles,                the holy Church's sacred prelates also hope for good results                for  themselves,  their  dioceses,  and  their  seminaries.                Otherwise,  why  would  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  have  instilled                and  recommended,  this  prayer  so  many  rimes  -  the  gospel                has: he used to say (Precious Adhesions, 1903 and 1921)?                (7)","6. PIOUS UNION OF THE EVANGELICAL ROGATION                      At  midnight  between  the  19th  and  the  20th  centuries  I                started a Pious Union of the Evangelical Rogation of Jesus'                Heart in the church connected with my institutes in Messing;                my  archbishop,  who  erected  it  canonically,  was  the  first                charter member.                      We use the word Rogation from the Latin word Rogate                which is a command to pray, also conforming to the spirit of                the Church that commands the rogation days to win spiritual                and temporal goods. We use the word Evangelical because                we find this command in the gospel and call it of the Jesus'                Heart because this prayer is mainly addressed to the same                divine  Heart  that  recommended  it  and  from  whom  the  holy                Church expects so great a mercy.                      This  pious  union  aims  at  spreading  everywhere  this                prayer  so  appropriate  to  our  times,  hoping  that  it  becomes                universal rogation in order to win so great a mercy from divine                goodness.                                                 234                      Consecrated to the most holy Heart of Jesus, the pious                union  is  also  entrusted  to  the  Queen  of  the  Apostles,                Immaculate Mary, whose Immaculate Heart forms one Heart                with  that  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  It  is  also  under  the                protection of St. Michael the archangel, St. Joseph, the holy                apostles, and the holy disciples of the Lord; the holy pontiffs,                the  holy  founders  of  religious  orders,  and  St.  Anthony  of                Padua are special patrons.                      Through His Eminence Card. Gennari I got a rescript by                the  Sacred  Congregation  of  Rites,  dated  Feb.  6,  1906,  ap-                proving  the  pious  initiative  and  granting  various  plenary  as                well as partial indulgences to the members.                      Women  and  men,  lay people  and  Religious may  share                this pious union under no obligation of conscience receiving","ing the free membership card along with some prayers. The                members have at heart to pray for good workers to the holy                Church (From a letter to the bishops, Jan. 1, 1920, and from                the membership card of the P.U.). (8)                                7. THE ROGATIONIST VERSE                      On July 11, 1909, I was with the Holy Father Pius X in                private audience petitioning him to add the following verse in                the  Litany  of  the  Saint:  «  That  you  send  out  numerous,                worthy,  and  holy  workers  in  your  harvest...  Lord,  hear  our                prayer. » His Holiness granted me the favor, benignly writing:                « Granted according to the petition, when the litany is said in                the institute. »                      Given all this, don't you think that it would be a blessing                of the Lord, a great hope for future vocations for the dioceses,                if this great command of our Lord Jesus Christ were picked                up  solemnly  and obeyed  properly by  placing  it  in  the  Major                Litanies?  In  this  way  the  Church  itself  would  pray  to  win   235                numerous, holy priests!                      Please  note  that  our  Lord  gave  this  command  to  the                teaching  Church  more  than  to  the  learning  Church;  as  a                matter of fact, the gospel has: He said to his disciples, that is,                to  the  apostles;  therefore,  it's  up  to  the  Church  to  pray                formally for this purpose. To reach such a goal the bishops                should  address  a  petition  to  Jesus  Christ's  supreme  vicar,                saying that Jesus Christ gave this command to the teaching                Church.                      Of course, there would be opposition and opponents as                there  were  when  new  devotions  and  practices  were                introduced, as for instance, devotion to the adorable Heart of                Jesus,  the  most  holy  name  of  Jesus  preached  by  St.                Bernardine,  and  the  title  Most  Precious  Blood  which  was                given to the congregation by Blessed Del","Bufalo.  Even    the  great  religious  orders  were  opposed.  But                prevailing  over  the  obstacles,  good  made  its  way  and                triumphed in the name of Jesus. For instance, the following                abjection was raised: the Major Litanies are ancient liturgical                prayers, and it is unsuitable to change them. But even though                fixed  in  the  dogmas,  the  holy  Church  has  been  always                adapting itself to worship and liturgy.                      To how many changes have we witnessed in our times?                The Loreto Litanies, which are as ancient as the major ones,                were  increased  with  the  following  verses:  Mother  of  Good                Counsel,  because  of  the  rash  proceeding  of  society  and                governments;  Queen  of  Peace,  because  of  the  world  war;                and earlier, with Queen of the Most Holy Rosary and Queen                Conceived  without  Original  Sin.  Besides  the  changes                introduced in the new canon law, the breviary has been also                reformed, the missal has been given two new prefaces, and                feasts of first class passed into second class.                      Well, now, if the holy Church made all these changes by                her own inspired, prudent initiative, why can't the Church add   236                to the Major Litanies a new verse for a prayer which has been                commanded  directly  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  with  these                words:  «  Pray,  therefore,...  »  etc.?  Why  cannot  the  Church                adopt the remedy to which our Lord Jesus Christ pointed for                this desolation, for this depopulated religion of our times?                      You could also remind the opponents that a new verse                was  introduced  in  the  Major  Litanies  when  the  Turks                threatened Italy and other Latin countries. The verse was: «                That You restrain and bring to nothing the efforts of the Turks                and  the  heretics,..  Lord,  hear  our  prayer.  »  When  the  risk                passed  away,  that  verse  was  eliminated  in  the  subsequent                versions.","Are we not in more serious dangers, both spiritual and                temporal, which require the work of the Lord's priests among                the people? What a surprise it would be if the Church inserted                into the Major Litanies a verse of vocation prayer in order to                apply  a  remedy  Jesus  recommended,  or  better  yet,                commanded through these divine wards: « Pray, therefore...                » etc.? (9)                      If  you  have  no  objections  against  my  poor  notes,  but                agree  that  they  are  based  on  evangelical  truths  and  are  a                remedy  to  our  gloomy  times,  I  implore  you  to  not  consider                that  it  was  the  ass  of  Balaam  that  spoke  these  words,                because the Holy Spirit blows wherever he wishes (Jn. 3, 8)                and God chose what the world looks down on, and despises,                and thinks is nothing (1 Cor. 1, 28); I beg you instead to write                a  fervent  petition  to  the  Holy  Father  Benedict  XV  with  zeal                and  eloquence,  asking  to  introduce  that  verse  in  the  Major                Litanies soon after the verse Ut Domnum Apostolicum etc...                      I  am  mailing  this  paper  to  all  the  bishops  hoping  that                many of them will send this petition to His Holiness, not only   237                because of my reasons, but also for even better reasons they                will  find  in  their  zeal  for  the  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests.  I  beg                you to be so kind as to let me know of your mailing it to His                Holiness. I will be very happy if your Secretary sends me a                copy.                      It  would  be  helpful  if  good  people  and  observant                communities of your diocese prayed together with you to the                most holy Heart of Jesus, his most holy mother, St. Joseph,                St. Michael the archangel, the holy apostles, the angels and                the  saints  of  the  diocese,  and  the  illustrious  St.  Anthony  of                Padua  in  order  that  this  pious,  opportune  enterprise  may                succeed  for  the  greatest  glory  of  the  most  holy  Trinity,  the                immense benefit of the holy Church, and the whole world as                well.","8. SUGGESTING A ROGATIONIST PASTORAL                      If  the  bishops  explained  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  great                command, « Pray, therefore,... » in the pastoral letter of the                coming Lent, they would do an excellent work.                      For that reason I beg you to publish a learned, touching                pastoral letter about that divine command, proving with zeal                that it is of great importance to all the people, but mainly to                the clergy, to pray to the owner of the mystical harvest to call                elect youths in the cities and the villages so that priests may                be  formed  by  the  Holy  Spirit,  evil  averted,  and  the  people                saved from the increasing spiritual and temporal ruin.                      Your  Excellence  could  conclude  this  very  opportune                pastoral  letter  by  referring  to  the  pious  union  of  the  Evan-                gelical  Rogation  of  Jesus'  Heart  and  by  exhorting  your                faithful,  chiefly  the  clergy, the  pious  souls, the  nuns,  etc.  to                join such a union. By doing so, you would draw the blessings                of God on your seminary and the mystical flock.                                                                          238                     Oh! If all the bishops did it in their dioceses, the prayer                that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  commanded  as  the  infallible                means  to  win  priests  according  to  the  Heart  of  God  would                become  a  universal  rogation.  It  would  do  a  strong,  sweet                violence to the most holy Heart of Jesus winning the grace, of                which the people have become unworthy.                      Your  Excellence  could  tell  a  pious,  zealous  priest  to                keep  in  touch  with  me  so  that  I  might  mail  to  him  the                membership cards for the free enlistment of as many persons                as possible.                      The  growth  of  this  prayer  or  evangelical  rogation  of                Jesus'  Heart  would  be  the  beginning  of  the  papal  favor  to                insert this prayer in the Major Litanies: it would","crown as definitely as solemnly the perfect obedience to the                great command of the divine zeal of Jesus' Heart! And how                much the divine Heart would be pleased!                      Don Rua, the first successor to Don Bosco, once told me                that  he  was  concerned  with  proposing  and  promoting  the                insertion  of  a  verse  analogous  to  the  Rogate  in  the  Major                Litanies,  but  he  couldn't  apply  himself  to  it. Nowadays  time                presses  more  and  more,  urging  the  universal  obedience  to                that divine command! (From the letter to the bishops, Jan. 1,                1920).                                           NOTES                     (1)  The Padre was writing on Oct. 10, 1900.                     (2)  Today,  only  the   Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  are  wearing  the                external   emblem.                     (3)  Keep in  mind  that our padre  is  speaking  of  himself.                     (4)  Here our padre is speaking in third person.      239                     (5)  In the preface to the  Precious Adhesions published  in 1903,                our  padre  talks  in  first  person  expressing  some  thoughts  we    deem                useful   to  refer.  To  begin  with,   he   acknowledges  that  the   original                idea   of   the   Sacred   Alliance   came   from   the   Madonna,   and                after touching   upon  the  serious  difficulties   the   institute  was   facing                he adds:                    «The elegant, lyric poet Ariel from Brescia, one of the elect group at                the beginning of our century (our padre was writing on Oct. 14, 1900),                wrote beautiful verses in honor of the most holy Virgin under (he title of                Good Counsel. I often called them to my mind when the storm grew so                furious that I saw no way to escape it. Through those delicate verses I                exclaimed:                        As   the   pilgrim  on   his  way  saw  you   clearing                        The  sky  of  clouds  by  blinking  your eyelash.                        Mother, clear and save my ship for sailing                                             Give  me a  lightflash!                     The most holy Virgin is the great channel through which all the","graces, no one excepted in St. Bernard's opinion, come down from                heaven, because she is in charge of the celestial treasure. We find her                at the beginning of the human salvation as well as at the head of the                works and the small or great institutions that rise in the Churoh.                    I  often  invoked  the  Mother  of  Good  Counsel  confidently,  and  the                following idea once crossed my mind: this institute absolutely needs a                divine help. As a matter of fact human help does not fit to the institutions                that aim at belonging totally to God as well as at working for his glory                and  the  salvation  of  souls.  I  deeply  felt  the  need  of  the  celestial                blessings! O God's blessings, how much desirable and how very fecund                of good you are!                    I joined these two ideas: I thought of the great sacrifice of the mass                as of the most effective means to obtain graces, since the victim which                we offer to the eternal Father is of infinite value. On the other hand (even                though this institute is the least among the institutions of the holy Church                and  still  in  the  first  stages),  the  mission  to  pray  in  order  to  win  good                workers to the holy Church is such that it warmly interests all the faithful,                each  Christian  having  at  heart  the  good  of  souls,  but  especially  the                bishops, the shepherds of the mystical flock, those wo are in charge of                souls, those who are the living apostles of Jesus Ohrist. I concluded that                no person in the world needs the good workers as much as the bishops;                therefore,  if  I  appeal  to  their  prayer  demanding  their  blessings  and                asking them to celebrate one mass in order to attract the divine mercies                on this little charitable institute, they will not deny it to me.   240                    This idea was like a ray in the darkness. I seemed to have found                the secret of the divine mercies.»                    Touching upon the happy results of this Sacred'Alliance, our padre                points out: «The blessings and the prayers of the holy Church's prelates                are  producing  their  good  effects  on  this  pious  institute  and  on  the                spreading of the vocation prayer. It is a consolation to see our Savior                Jesus' command being welcomed and obeyed.                    Several bishops have asked to introduce the vocation prayer book                in  their  dioceses,  especially  in  the  religious  communities.  The  daily                recitation  of  such  prayers  in  the  seminaries  is  of  greater  importance,                because  they  improve  the  culture  of  the  holy  vocations  and  develop                them as well. Besides attracting divine mercy on their good success. by                saying  these  daily  prayers  the  clerics  become  more  aware  of  the                priesthood's importance and mission, finding a practical rule to sanctify                themselves becoming good evangelical workers for the divine glory and                the salvation of souls.                    Not satisfied by their spiritual help through the yearly mass, prayers,                and daily blessings several bishops from Italy have also","joined this pious institute's prayers in order to win good workers to' the                holy Church by applying their good works and practices of piety to reach this                goal. »                    (6)    This   title   was   perhaps   suggested   by   a   previous   priestly                association  called  Sacred  Alliance at  the Altar,  which    the  S.   Con-                gregation of the Indulgences endowed with many favors on Aug. 18, 1868. It                was  formed  in  Palermo  by  a  few  priests  who  wished  to  join  the  Sicilian                priests  at  the  foot  of  Jesus  Christ's  altar  in  these  most  lamentable  times;                through  this   union  of    prayer,    they  meant  to  entreat Jesus for our                wretched    homeland,  for  our    brothers    in    Ireland  and  Poland,  for  those                ensnared  by    the  error,    for    the  Holy    Father's  triumph,      and      for    the                Catholic   Church's   exaltation»   (The   Catholic Word, Nov. 15, 1868).                    (7)      The  Sacred  Alliance  started  with  the  adhesion  of  Mons.  John                Blandini, bishop of Noto, and has suffered many changes and developments.                First,  it appealed to 12  bishops in Sicily for the apostolic mass, in honor of                the holy apostles;  second, it appealed to all the bishops   in   Sicily   and                later   in   Italy;   third,   it   appealed   to   all   the priests.                    At the beginning, the requests were three; later, the sacred allies were                invited to |oin the institute's intentions in the  prayers to win good workers.                The  intentions  of  the  Sacred  Alliance,  which  has  been  called  Priestly                Rogationist Crusade, are the following:                                            DUTIES                     The members pledge with no obligation of conscience:                    1)  To offer the divine mass once a year or, at least, a special memento                (silent prayer during the mass)  to win  many, holy priests.   241                    2)  To join the Rogationists' daily  prayers and to pray for vocations to                their  institute.                    3)  To pray during the mass, at least .through habitual intention, that the                persons who are called  by the Lord  may  perfectly answer their priestly  or                religious vocation.                    4)    To  apply    the    blessings  at    the  end    of  the    mass  or    in    other                circumstances  to   the  wordly  priesthood,  to   the  benefactors  of  the                ecclesiastical  vocations,   and  to  the  Rogationist  institutions.                                       SPIRITUAL  RETURN                     The Rogationists consider their sacred allies as associates in their spirit                of prayer, they pledge therefore:                    1)  To  celebrate  one  holy   mass  a   week  for  the  sacred  allies'                intentions.                    2)    To  pray  every  day  for  the  sacred  allies'  sanctification,  for  the                parishes  and  the  souls  entrusted  to  them,  for  the  dioceses  and  their                seminaries  as  well    as  for  the    novitiates  and    the    intentions    of    the.                superiors general who are  sacred allies.","3)  To celebrate  holy   masses for the  sacred  allies  as soon  as                the notice of their death arrives.                    4)  To   celebrate   perpetual   masses   for   the   dead   sacred                allies.  In    1960,      our  spiritual    benefactors    were:    cardinals    19;                bishops  162; priests  1,054.                    8) To spread the Pious Union, our padre relied on the bishops' zeal.                In a circular on Oct. 4, 1908, after saying of the Pious Union's existence                and aim he added:                    « First, I dare beg your Excellence to make your venerable name                entered in  the sacred  allies  book  so  that your  clergy  and  faithful  may                follow your example.                    Second, I ask your Excellency for permission to introduce this Pious                Union in your diocese. Later, I will write directly to the pastors or other                zealous priests or even to pious lay persons.                    If you would like to let me know the names of pastors or priests or                other persons, to whom I may write in order to reach greater results, I                would  have  additional  reasons  to  thank  your  charity.  To  please  you                more,  I  will  also  inscribe  your  seminarians  as  members  of  the  Pious                Union so that the most holy Heart of Jesus may form many holy workers                for your diocese's harvest. »                    In 1922 our padre mailed another circular, repeating the invitation                and concluding: « Excellence, I appeal to your great zeal. The matter is                of the greatest importance for your diocese. For the most loving, sweet                Heart of Jesus, please introduce this Pious Union in your diocese.   242                    Your Excellence may erect the Pious Union in a church of yours or                you may make me enter into correspondence with one of your zealous                priests to make things go on. I will mail membership cards along with all                is required, the stamps for the mail included. God and everything. »                    A warm invitation to the Catholic editors to spread the prayer for the                good  workers  as  well  as  to  invite  the  people  to  join  the  Pious  Union                traces back to before the 1908 earthquake: « Here and there the people                begin feeling the need to obey the divine command, « Pray, therefore, to                the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in His                harvest»  (Ml.  9,  38  -  Lk.  10,  2).  Various  periodicals  are  concerning                themselves  with  spreading  this  prayer  in  order  to  win  numerous,  holy                priests to the holy Church from the owner of the mystical harvest. Such                prayers begin appearing here and there.                    Because  it  is  30 years since  I began concerning myself  with  this                aim through new institutions, prayers, prayer books, periodicals, and a                universal  Pious  Union  which  has  been  approved  and  provided  with                indulgences  by  the  Holy  See,  I  ask  you  to  concern  yourself  with  it                through your excellent periodical or newspaper, for the Lord's","glory  and  the  good  of  souls.  I  submit  some  periodicals  to  you  in                Older  that  you  may  realize  the  progress  we  have  made  in  this  ad-                vertisement as  well as  how  bishops,  archbishops,  cardinals, superiors                general of religious orders, and popes have received and promoted it.                    However, we work hard to spread it, and I warmly recommend K to                your zeal. For the sake of the most holy Heart of Jesus, please help the                periodicals  that  I am mailing  to  you; advertise  them  in your  periodical                and  invite  the  people  to  join  the  universal  Pious  Union  that  is  free  of                charge and lays no obligation of conscience upon the people.                    When  this  prayer  that  Jesus  Christ  commanded  is  spread  in  the                holy Church, much good will come to the nations. In fact, the secret of                the Church and society's salvation is dependent on the priests of God                and on the new zealous apostles of charity that divine mercy will send                out! How can God deny our request when he himself commanded us to                pray for it? Our disregard for it till now is the cause of such a pitiable lack                of elect workers in the mystical harvest!...                    If  you  concern  yourself  with  this  holy  advertisement,  you  will                deserve  a  great  reward  because  your  advertisement  will  raise  new                apostles who will operate a great deal of good in the holy Church, which                will be your crown of inconceivable glory in the kingdom of heaven!»                    Our padre had also begun an advertisement or Rogationist crusade                in  the sister  monasteries, but he had to stop  because more than  one                convent was hurt by the proposal as if it were a change to its rules or                traditions. It is understood that those good Religious had not understood   243                the point!                    (9)  Our  padre  was  writing  in  1920;  the  objection  was  not  a                theoretical one. Card. Gasparri opposed the insertion of the Rogationist                verse  in  the  Major  Litanies  because  of  their  venerable  antiquity.  This                objection, however, was dropped soon after when Pius XI introduced the                verse Ut omnes errantes. etc.","244","CHAPTER VII                                    RELIGIOUS VOWS                      I acknowledge that the essence of the religious life                consists  in  the  three  vows  of  poverty,  obedience,  and                chastity.                                       1. PREPARATION                         Each  religious  community  is  based  on  the  perfect                observance  of  the  three  evangelical  -counsels:  poverty,                obedience,  and  chastity.  If  divine  mercy  grants  this  Pious                Institute of the Poor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus the grace to                form a religious community, the profession and observance of                the  three  vows  mentioned  above,  called  evangelical                counsels, will 'be after the postulate.                     To  become  worthy  to  profess  the  rule  and  the  three   245                vows,  the  probationers  must  accustom  themselves  to                practicing  the  virtues  of  perfect  chastity,  free  poverty,  and                exact  obedience  beginning  with  the  time  of  entrance.  Even                though they do not take the vows by entering the postulate,                still  they  have  to  embrace  these  virtues  by  resolving  or                proposing the practice of them (P.R.P.).                         To  prepare  themselves  to  the  religious  profession,                the youths will pay careful attention to adorn their soul with                holy  virtues,  especially  charity,  humility,  immaculate  purity,                perfect  obedience,  meekness  and  gentleness,  patience,                modesty,  and  perseverance.  They  will  love  seclusion,                recollection,  prayer,  meditation,  spiritual  reading,  holy  talk,                silence, and the practice of being in the","divine presence Candid and sincere, they will do everything                with pure intention, offering  themselves as victims to Jesus,                our supreme goodness (Speech, Sept. 4, 1909).                         The  Little  Retreat  novices  will  nurture  in  their  heart                the longing to take the religious vows of chastity, obedience,                poverty, and a fourth vow that is so dear to God in order  to                belong  totally  to  Jesus  and  to  help  the  people.  In  the                meantime they will accurately practice the virtues concerning                the vows they hope to profess when the merciful God allows                it, being aware that they cannot be worthy of doing it, unless                they  observe  the  virtues  for  a  conventional  period  of  time                (R.L.P.).                      Dearest  daughters,  I  exhort  you  to  draw  yourselves                closer to our beloved Jesus Christ, our supreme goodness, to                grow in his love, to desire to love him, and to have pity on his                Heart's pains consoling him through your fervent practice of                holy virtues. Please renew your resolutions, starting a new life                with humility, mortification, obedience, and prayer in order to                prepare  yourselves  to  pronounce  the  vows  and  to  commit   246                yourselves to the service of God. Please light the wise virgins'                lamp because the groom is about to come together with his                mother, the most holy Mary. Look at this great mother and at                the glorious Patriarch St. Joseph so that your upright wishes                may  be  fulfilled  through  their  powerful  intercession  (Letter,                July 2, 1888).                      The Religious will take the vows of chastity, poverty, and                obedience  in  the  presence  of  this  pious  institute's  director.                Because  this  little  order  stands  far  the  sacred  banner                announcing  the  evangelical  motto  «Pray,  therefore,  to  the                owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in                his harvest,» the congregants will also take the fourth vow of                the daily prayer which aims at winning good workers to the                holy Church (P.R.P.).","2. THE PROFESSION                      What  is  a  vow?  It  is  a  resolute  promise  to  God  to                perform a possible and higher good for God's glory and for                our perfection. This is the theology's definition we are going                to look into.                         A  promise to  God.  When  a  person promises  some-                thing, he honors the person to whom he promises by showing                love  and  respect  or  by  acknowledging  his  duty  of                thanksgiving and subjection. As by keeping his promise, he                confirms his love, respect, thanksgiving, and subjection, so by                breaking his word, he denies love, respect, thanksgiving, and                the subjection to which he was bound. When a person makes                the promise he seems to say: I esteem, respect, honor, and                love you, therefore I make a promise to show such feelings;                on the contrary, when he breaks his word he seems to say: I                do not esteem, respect, honor, and love you because when I                made  the  promise,  I  cheated  you.  This  is  meant  by  the                promise's  non-execution.  Besides,  the  more  the  person  to                whom we promise is noble and worthy, the more our offence   247                is grave when we break our word.                      To  whom  do  the  people  make  the  religious  vow?  To                God!  When  a  Religious  takes  the  vows,  he  acknowledges                God  as  the  Lord  to  whom  he  must  be  subject,  as  the                benefactor he has to thank, as the holy of the holiest he has                to honor through the practice of the virtues. On the contrary,                when  a  Religious  breaks  his  ward,  he  denies  God  as  the                Lord, benefactor, supreme goodness, and the holiest!                      Resolute promise. What does the vow imply? A strictest                observance of it. Before taking the vows freely, the Religious                meditated a year upon it preparing himself through retreat to                make  a  free  decision.  Therefore,  his  breaking  off  has  no                excuse.","A  possible  and  higher  good.  The  condition  that  the                vow  must  be  possible  and  better  than  its  contrary  is  in-                dispensable for the vow's validity. This doctrine drives us to                consider  these  sublime  topics:  what  we  have  promised  is                better than its contrary, chastity is better than conjugal status,                poverty  Is  better  than  possessing,  obedience  is  better  than                living free.                         For His glory. This is the vow's chief aim. By observ-                ing the vows, the Religious glorifies God! Yes! By doing so,                he  acknowledges  God  before  the  world,  acknowledges  the                religious truths, and increases the worship to God by winning                souls to him.                         For  our  perfection.  The  vows'  second  aim  is  our                sanctification. Our observing them helps us to reach this goal,                because  the  vows  are  the  turning  point  of  the  religious  life                (Speech, May 10, 1908).                         Before  taking  the  holy  vows,  please  consider  that                they are so important as to make you indebted toward God,   248                your  transgressions  heavier,  and  you  yourselves  obliged  to                give  a  strict  account  of  them.  Not  taking  the  vows  is  better                than  taking  them  with  levity  or  without  a  resolute  mind  to                observe them. Dearest children, please consider the step you                are  going  to  take.  If  you  feel  yourselves  unprepared  or                unwilling, you can go black to the place of the novices with                holy caution.                         But if you feel drawn by pure, holy intention to resolu-                tely  bind  yourselves  to  Jesus  through  the  vows  of  chastity,                poverty, and obedience, please take your vows with a steady                mind  of  observing,  renewing  them  every  year,  and                persevering until you take them for ever through the perpetual                profession.  By  professing  you  bind  yourselves  to  the                observance of the constitutions and the rules, as well as to                the meaning, degree, and circumstances that they foresee.","My  dearest  children,  now  let  us  adore  our  Lord  in  the                Holy Sacrament imploring from the divine Heart of Jesus, the                Immaculate Heart of Mary, your angels and saints the divine                help you need so much in this important moment of your life                (Speech, Oct. 12, 1910).                         Renewing the vows is of a great importance. Like a                boat leaving the harbor and going toward the open sea, our                soul  is  leaving  the  world,  going  deeply  into  the  sea  of  all                goods, which is the religious life, in order to be closer to Gad.                Let us consider the two extremes: the world we leave and the                God we are about to join. By doing so, we will appreciate the                regular  life  nurturing  gratitude,  and  fervor  as  well  (Speech,                1902).                         Daughters, what is the liturgy we have performed for                you? What is the step you have undertaken? In the presence                of Jesus in the Holy Sacrament, you have taken the perpetual                vows throughout the  formalities of the religious service; you                have  given  up  yourselves  to  God  through  the  vows  of                poverty, chastity, and obedience. But, did you think of it? Did   249                you consider that you have renounced both your freedom and                will  for  ever,  that  you  have  bound  yourselves  to  the  will  of                others  that  you  have  given  up  your rights  over  things?  Oh!                Why didn't you come back to the world? Why didn't you think                of  seeking  new  affections,  good  opportunities  of  fun,  and                freedom in the world?                         I feel that you are saying: father, we left the world for                ever to surrender to Jesus; through the vows, we have lost no                freedom; on the contrary, we feel ourselves freer!                         You are right! Happy you, who are given this under-                standing  by  the  Lord!  Religious  profession  is  the  consum-                mation and the fulfillment of the spiritual wedding between","Jesus  and  the  soul:  it  is  the  topmost  of  the  ascensions                (Speech, March 30, 1919).                         Consecrating oneself to God is a holiest religious act                which gives a greatest glory and happiness to a creature on                earth.  Consecrating  oneself  to  God!  The  things  which  are                consecrated to God are sacred (Speech, May 5, 1912)!                             3. THROUGH ST. JOSEPH'S HANDS                         Brothers, sisters, and children in Jesus Christ, today                is  a  double  solemnity  for  us  because  we  are  honoring  St.                Joseph by renewing our vows.                         This holy patriarch is the protector and patron of all,                but  chiefly  of  those  who  embrace  religious  life.  Professing                every year on St. Joseph's patronage feast makes us happily                hope  to  achieve  his  help  in  order  to  observe  the  vows                perfectly, imitating him, who is our model (Speech, 1906).                                                                          250                        It has been since a few years that we gather on St.                Joseph's feast to renew our vows. This day has been always                dear,  memorable,  and  holy  for  us  because  we  have  taken                breathe under the auspices of the Church's patron (Speech,                1910).                          4. ...AND UNDER THE MADONNA'S CLOAK                         How  will  we  dare  belong  to  Jesus  through  holy                profession? We are frightened by simply thinking of it! Owing                to  his  most  holy  Heart's  infinite  goodness,  however,  out  of                love  Jesus  does  not  look  at  a  soul's  failings!  Sweetest                mother,  if  Jesus  wants  us,  please  purify  our  soul  with  new                grace, clothing us with new virtues under your","motherly care. Make us share in your innocence, infuse in us                a bit of our inexpressible humility, and instill part of the divine                love  that  is  burning  in  your  Immaculate  Heart.  O  beautiful                Immaculate Mary, take us to the mystical wedding with Jesus,                our  supreme  goodness;  if  we  are  accompanied  by  you,  we                won’t die by confusion in his presence, his clemency instead                will bend toward us. If your divine Son along with you wants                us  to  profess,  oh,  win  from  his  most  holy  Heart  so  much                grace as to make us his slaves of love from now on, make us                his  everlasting  faithful  by  imitating  his  divine  virtues,  by                observing  the  religious  rules,  by  seeking  the  last  place  for                ourselves, and by fostering his honor, glory, consolation, and                interests. May we accomplish it especially through the daily                prayer to win good workers to the holy Church, through our                continuous work and sacrifice for the salvation of souls, and                the relief of the poor (From a petition, May 7, 1917).                          5. HOW TO OBSERVE OUR FOUR VOWS                         We  can  observe  chastity  through  prayer,  holy   251                thoughts,  mortification,  Communion,  devotion  to  Mary,  St.                Louis,  the  saints  as  well  as  by  humility  and  avoidance  of                idleness.                         We observe poverty through detachment, care of little                things,  the  monthly  examination,  and  penance  such  as                abstinence from comfort and food.                         We observe obedience by trying to lose our own will                and by blind, ready, joyous, and supernatural obedience.                         Vow  of  obedience  to  our  Rogate.  What  a  beautiful                obedience is this one! It joins us directly with our Lord Jesus                Christ! He founded our order! I do not dwell on","its importance and goods, but I say this only: let us obey by                praying and by encouraging the people to pray to win good                evangelical workers (Speech, May 10, 1908)!                                       A. POVERTY                         As  far  as  I am  concerned  with  poverty,  I  declare  to                hold  it  as  the  most  precious  pearl, as  the foundation  of  my                vocation  and  of  the  institute's  existence.  By  consecrating                myself to this institute I mean to commit myself with transport                of love to poverty, contemplating it in our adorable Lord Jesus                Christ, the most holy Virgin, and the saints who practiced it                with holy enthusiasm.                         I  will  hold  it  as  the  fountain  of  priceless  celestial                treasures, knowing that until this institute is evangelically poor                and  glories  in  poverty,  it  will  stand  firm  and  unshakeable,                improving day by day. But if it grows weak in the practice of                holy  poverty,  it  will  go  to  ruin,  ending  as  so  many  religious                communities have done before.                                                                          252                        So, I will be most attentive to avoid offence against                holy  poverty  as  well  as  to  give  bad  example,  which  could                make others vacillate in such a vital religious virtue and vow.                When  the  people  dispute  or  discuss  or  interpret  the  rules,                with  God's  help  and  my  own  will  I  promise  to  favor  the                strictest theory about the evangelical poverty's observance. In                practice,  I  promise  to  embrace  holy  poverty  in  all  its                manifestations, and specifically:                         1.     Until this institute's rules concede the radical                possession  on  one's  own  property,  I  will  hold  it  with  holy                detachment,  ready  to  renounce  it  when  this  order's  chapter                and the superior authority will compel to do so. (1)                         2.     I  will  hold  back  nothing  from  my  capital's                profit, but will hand over everything to the superiors, empower","ing them even to cash, if they ask for it. Likewise I will quickly                turn over all stipends of masses, preaching, and alms to the                superiors.                         3.     I  will  retain  no  room,  furniture,  clothes,                clothing  and  anything  else  as  mine;  on  the  contrary  I  will                receive  everything  from  the  institute  as  out  of  charity;                therefore I will never say: my room, my clothes, my objects; I                will say instead: the room where I dwell, the objects I use.                         4.     I  promise  to  love  holy  poverty  for  my  Lord                Jesus  Christ,  who  was  poor  and  suffering.  While  lacking                something I cannot have, I will conform and suffer in peace                rejoicing in my use of the poor things such as the room, the                clothes, the bed, the food, and anything else.                         5.     I will always pray to the Lord to give me the                spirit of holy poverty.                                1. MOST PRECIOUS VIRTUE                     253                         Poverty  is  a  most  precious  virtue  the  Son  of  God                embraced  for  our  sake  and  example.  This  divine  virtue  is                completely  unknown  to  the  world,  which  considers  the  rich                people  happy,  whereas  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  threatened                them, but said to the have-nots: happy the poor.                         The perfect observance of poverty enriches the soul                with  every  good.  It  creates,  keeps,  and  strengthens  the                communities.  In  fact,  even  the  most  flourishing  religious                communities decline and fail for lack of poverty's observance!                Because of that, the probationers are warmly recommended                to observe holy poverty. They will have nothing of their own,                but  everything  will  be  in  common;  they  will  keep  no  thing                secretly,  they  will  make  no  gift  or  loan,  but  will  give  their                boxes' key to the superiors.","Having  nothing  is  not  enough  for  the  probationers;                they  must  be  also  detached  from  the  desire  of  owning,                embracing the poverty's inconveniences about clothes, food,                dwelling,  and  bearing  any  want  for  God's  sake.  The                probationers  will  glory  in  this  precious  evangelical  pearl,                saying:  We  seem  to  have  nothing,  yet  we  really  possess                everything (2 Cor. 6, 10) (P.R.P.). (2)                         The  Little  Retreat  novice  will  nurture  a  particular                affection  and  a  tender,  strong  love  toward  the  holy  evan-                gelical  poverty.  Each  novice  will  strive  to  love  poverty  as                much  as  the  world  strives  to  love  riches.  Since  the  world                loves riches with a predominant passion, without getting tired                in growing rich or in buying the most it can, so the Little Poor                of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  will  love  holy  poverty  with  a                predominant  transport  and  will  be  never  satisfied  but                becoming always more poor, surrendering all that is surplus                and detaching her heart from earthly things more and more                (R.L.P.). (3)                         Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  preached  holy  poverty  by   254                divine words, but above all by example. He became poor to                such a degree that he had no place where to rest his head.                For that reason evangelical poverty is a precious treasure for                the  people  who  love  Jesus  Christ,  who  said:  «  Happy  are                those  who  know  they  are  spiritually  poor;  the  kingdom  of                heaven  belongs  to  them  »  (Mt.  5,  3)!  The  saints  loved  this                sublime  virtue of  poverty  with  tender  transport.  The  more  a                soul  dispossesses  herself,  renouncing  everything  for  God's                sake, the more God fulfills her with himself, and he becomes                her  treasure.  To  achieve  everything,  one  must  lose                everything.                         To  be  always  fond  of  holy  poverty,  each  Little  Poor                novice  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  will  look  at  her  divine                model saying to herself: « I entered the novitiate to find Jesus                only, but he is poorest; so, if I want Jesus","only I have to embrace him along with his holy poverty ». The                Little Poor novice will also look at the examples of the most                holy Virgin and of the saints (R.L.P.).                         Reading  books  and  listening  to  speeches  which                foster love of holy poverty improves one's love for it. The con-                gregants  will  meditate  an  the  divine  model  Jesus  Christ  as                well as on the most holy Virgin and the saints, especially on                St. Francis of Assisi and St. Joseph Labre's  poverty without                feeling ashamed of appearing poor for the glory of our Lord                Jesus Christ's poverty. They, however, will always be clean in                appearance and attire (C.R.).                                  2. FEAR OF SLACKENING                         Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  and  Little  Poor  of  Jesus'                Heart,  be  lovers  and  observers  of  holy  poverty,  but  fear                slackening,  because  many  religious  orders  that  were  once                flourishing like trees full of years in the holy Church became                parched  and  failed  in  short  time  after  they  broke  from  holy   255                poverty! Slackening came about, and the order went to ruin!                Many  great  convents  and  monasteries  once  flourishing  with                saints,  now  are  profane  houses  or  places  of  sin  and                blasphemies,   because    the   communities   neglected                evangelical  poverty!  God  stopped  favoring  'those  loose                orders; the holy founders acknowledged them as their own no                longer, so they ended! The enemy passed through the broken                poverty as a furious winner putting everyone to the edge of                his sword, heaping ruin!                         Institutes  rise,  progress,  and  expand  wonderfully                when  they  are  based  on  the  observance  of  evangelical                poverty. God blesses such institutes abundantly, the adorable                Jesus  Christ  acknowledges  them  as  his  own,  because  he                embraced  holy  poverty  as  his  heart's  delight  loving  both  its                inconveniences and want. The most holy","Virgin  becomes  owner,  mother,  superior,  and  provider  of                these  communities,  which  grow  rich  with  celestial  goods                having  everything  necessary  to  life.  So  they  can  say:  «We                seem to have nothing, yet we really possess everything » (2                Cor. 6, 10) (P.C.Z.).                         To be truly poor, the Little Poor of Jesus' Heart not                only  wishes  nothing  sumptuous  and  vainglorious,  but  also                maintains her heart free from even the affection to the poor,                necessary things. To better reach such a goal, at the renewal                of the yearly vows and promises as well as when it is handy                during  the  year,  she  will  make  an  affective  arid  effective                renunciation.                         To become truly poor, each sister will receive every-                thing out of charity such as the room, food, clothes, and even                water  holding  herself  worthy  of  nothing,  even  though  she                works in benefit of the institute. So that the sisters may have                nothing  of  their  own  they  will  live  together,  as  much  as                possible avoiding saying: my room, my clothes, and the like;                they will say instead: the room where I dwell, the clothes I am   256                wearing.                         To  be  truly  poor  in  spirit,  they  will  have  no  worry                about flood, clothes, and anything else, but will rest trustful in                the  divine  providence's  hands,  sure  that  till  they  seek  God                alone  no  thing  necessary  to  their  subsistence  will  fail                according  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  infallible  words:  «  Be                concerned above everything else with His kingdom and with                what He requires, and He will provide you with all these other                things » (Mt. 6, 33) (R.L.P.).                            3. LET US REMEMBER OUR ORIGINS                      For  holy  poverty's  sake  each  sister  will  avoid  keeping                even the least thing secretly, or by negligence, such as books                or images or objects of devotion, because","receiving or keeping a little thing, even indifferently, gives way                to  the  devil  who  would  want  you  to  delight  in  and  later                become attached to it. Then new possession will increase, as                will your attachment, so that the spirit of holy poverty goes to                ruin! Holy poverty requires that each be detached from room,                place, clothes, and everything.                         To  feel  ashamed  for  wearing  a  poor  or  mended  or                faded dress as well as warn shoes offends holy poverty. May                God, Immaculate Mary, the angels, and the saints bless that                sister  who  is  fond  of  wearing  poor  clothes and  worn  shoes                even in public.                         The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal's  origin  was  in  Mes-                sina's most abject, poor place, the most miserable beggars'                center  of  pitiable,  crumbling  slums.  It  was  there  that  the                sisters  were  given  their  first  glorious  name of  Little  Poor  of                Jesus'  Heart.  By  always  remembering  their  origin  and  by                keeping in mind that each house must have a mark of their                primal poverty as much as possible, the sisters will be worthy                of  such  a  precious,  honorable  name;  therefore  let  furniture,   257                accessories, refectory, and everything be poor; even though                sufficient, let the food be poor and simple.                         For the Daughters of Divine Zeal, true love and glory                of  poverty  consist  in  bearing  joyously  its  inconveniences,                want, and humiliation (F.R.).                         The Daughters of Divine Zeal will pay careful atten-                tion to the holy writers teaching that the persons really poor in                spirit  are  fond of  poverty's  inconveniences;  for  instance,  St.                Francis  of  Sales  says  that  desiring  the  comforts  of  riches                along with the honors of poverty is too ambitious; therefore,                the sisters will hold themselves happy and privileged by God                when  they  suffer  want  and  inconvenience  in  the  matter  of                food, dwelling, and everything (L.C.).","Possessing  nothing  is  not  enough  for  a  sister  to  be                really  poor  in  spirit;  but  she  must  be  also  ready  and                determined  to  even  renounce  a  kingdom  for  the  poverty  of                Jesus Christ, who became poor for us!                         Daughter of Divine Zeal, mold your heart through this                sublime disposition, and you will be holy! The divine lover will                accept  your  disposition  as  if  you  had  really  renounced  a                kingdom  along  with  its  earthly  glory  for  his  sake!  He  will                enrich you on earth with his celestial treasures making you a                queen  of  the  eternal  kingdom  along  with  its  infinite  glory  in                heaven!  Perfect  poverty  is  poverty  in  spirit,  which  refuses                effectively not only all the world, but also requires detachment                from useful, necessary things, from spiritual pleasure in order                to  seek  God  alone,  together  with  His  pure  will.  It  'is  this                spiritual nudity which forms the union of love between Jesus                and the soul (F.R.).                               4. POVERTY AND ECONOMY                         This  institute  will  usually  earn  its  means  of   258                subsistence by work. The articles produced will be sold at the                right price avoiding bargaining as much as possible (L.C).                         The  great  religious  virtue  of  poverty  requires  that                good  care  be  taken  of  the  provisions,  doing  everything                without  unnecessary  expenses  or  with  a  minimum  of                expense. Attention must be also paid to prevent deterioration                because  a  minor  waste  offends  the  virtue  or  the  vow  of                poverty (L.C).                         The  mother  superiors  will  avoid  spending  unneces-                sary money for the community's maintenance, remembering                that they have taken the vow of poverty, that they must use                (and not abuse) the divine providence's affluence, otherwise                they offend our Lord, stopping him from","helping  us.  The  community  must  be  provided  with  the                necessary food, clothes, furniture, accessories, etc., avoiding                the surplus. (4)                         Exception  to  saving  and  economy  are  the  following                cases:  the  furniture  of  our  churches  and  oratories  and  the                relieving of the sick people in our institutes, orphanages, and                asylums.  The  mother  superiors  will  behave with  generosity,                sacrifice, faith, and love toward Jesus in the Holy Sacrament;                however, for expenses going beyond 300 liras (5) they have                to ask the permission from the general council, which will be                generous  with  God's  house  decorum,  if  the  recurring                community  has  the  money.  To  heal  and  relieve  the  sick                people, everything must be done with generosity, charity, and                according to the means at disposal (S.D.D.Z.).                                       B. OBEDIENCE                         As to holy obedience, I declare that thus virtue forms                the  life  and  the  existence  of  all  religious  institutes.  As  the   259                natural order subsists because the elements obey the laws of                divine will (should they disobey, the cosmos would end in a                moment),  so  a  religious  house  subsists  through  faithful,                perfect  obedience;  should  obedience  fail,  the  natural  and                supernatural means for its existence would end.                         I acknowledge that holy obedience is a virtue leading                to perfect sanctification and to union with God, because the                people  accomplish  God's  will  perfectly  by  obeying  the                superiors along with the rules. Obedience is also the surest,                safest,  and  shortest  way  to  reach  great  perfection,  and  a                religious  house  where  all  the  people  obey  religiously  is  a                kingdom  of  God  on  earth.  Humble  obedience  is  perfect                imitation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who","always proclaimed to do his Father's will up to the death on                the  cross;  by  doing  so,  the  obedient  person  transforms                himself into Jesus Christ.                         Disobedience,  instead,  makes  the  people  resemble                Lucifer,  who  said:  «I  will  not  serve».    If  prohibited  by                obedience,  even  the  good  actions  became  bad,  While  the                most indifferent ones became worthy of great merit when they                are accomplished by obedience. Always bearing in mind the                Holy Spirit's saying « the speech of the obedient will always                be  heard,»  I  will  strive  with  all  my  strength  to  obey  my                superiors, the rules, and the constitutions.                        That my obedience be in the Lord and useful to my-                self as well as to the 'institute, I declare:                         1. From now an, I renounce unreservedly my will at                the  hands  of  my  superiors  following  the  hierarchical                competence.                        2. I will not be obstinate in my judgment and opinion;                on  the  contrary,  by  obeying  exteriorly  I  also  intend  to  obey                interiorly, conforming my judgments and points of view to the   260                superiors judgments and points of view.                        3. I promise to obey for supernatural reasons such as                pleasing the Sacred Heart of Jesus, setting good example to                others, seeing Jesus Christ in the superiors, and obeying for                Gads sake. I promise such obedience not only in the things I                like,  but  also  in  those  I  dislike,  keeping  in  mind  that  such                obedience is meritorious and that we win the kingdom of God                by subjugating ourselves.                         4. My obedience will be ready never delaying for any                reason; joyous, having internal and external pleasure, at least                in  the  will,  because  «  God  delights  in  the  people  who  give                with  joy  »  ;  exact,  accomplishing  the  superiors'  command                entirely  and  conforming  my  judgment  and  will  to  theirs;                simple, without changing the orders by","reasoning;  faithful  and  constant,  obeying  the  orders,  the                constitutions, and the rules without delay and disregard.                         5. At last, I declare to do everything by obedience; for                instance, if I have to go out or eat or drink between meals or                receive people or leave out some rule or anything else, I will                ask  the  permission  from  the  superior  each  time  or  every                month.  As  to  the  receiving or  writing  letters  or  messages,  I                will do so through the superiors.                         I will pray every day to the adorable Heart of Jesus to                make me a perfect obedient Religious (C.R.).                            1. OBEDIENCE: LIFE OF THE ORDER                         Since without obedience no religious order can stand,                obedience  must  be  regarded  by  the  congregants  as  the                order's  life.  Distinguishing  between  the  observance  of  the                vow and the observance of the virtue of obedience, by vow                the  congregants  must  obey  the  superiors  in  everything   261                concerning the institute and its rules. They are bound to obey                in minor things under light obligation of conscience, but when                the command is given explicitly under precept of obedience,                they are bound to obey under grave obligation of conscience.                As to the virtue of obedience, the congregants will hold that                they  cannot  be  good  Religious  without  obedience,  because                love  of  God,  zeal  for  the  divine  glory,  humility,  chastity,                poverty, charity, and vocation fail without it. Their chief care,                therefore, will be becoming victims of holy obedience, mindful                of our Lord Jesus Christ who was obedient up to the death.                They will glory in depending on other's mind for everything,                striving to make their obedience -ready - joyous - exact - for                supernatural  reason  -  seeing  God  in  the  person  who  is                commanding. This way, the","soul will quickly reach the most perfect union with God (C.R).                (6)                         Obedience  is  the  fundamental  virtue  of  a  religious                community, which cannot exist without it. Through obedience                the  Religious  soon  becomes  holy,  mortifies  her  passions,                becomes dearest to the Lord, and keeps herself safe from the                devil,  the  world,  and  her  own  selfishness,  While  also                achieving  the  other  virtues.  The  Religious  who  is  perfectly                subdued  to  obedience,  enjoys  great  peace  along  with                freedom of spirit, and the more she seems tied, the more she                is free. Putting herself in the hands of the Lord as malleable                wax to be shaped as he wants, the obedient Religious will be                Jesus Christ's spouse because he was obedient to his Father                up to the death for our sake (C.D.D.Z.). (7)                         Jesus Christ and the most holy Virgin are the perfect                models of perfect obedience. Next follow the examples of the                saints  who  esteemed  obedience  more  than  raptures  and                miracles. The holy writers say that it is better performing an                act of obedience than having the power of reviving the dead,   262                and the saints prefer obedience to the greatest penance and                to  the  holy  works.  As  sin  came  into  the  world  by                disobedience,  so  the  virtues  enter  the  souls  by  obedience                making  them  pleasant  to  God.  Therefore,  the  community                practicing perfect obedience is a community of angels.                         To  fully  appreciate  this  virtue,  we  notice  that  God                holds obedience as preferable to his orders, as we know from                the  people  who  experienced  that  in  supernatural  ways.  For                instance,  St.  Veronica  Giuliani  was  told  by  the  most  holy                Virgin, You will not say « I always want to do God's will and                holy  obedience,  »  but  will  say  «  l  always  want  to  do  holy                obedience and God's will » (C.D.D.Z.).                         The aspirant will nurture a great love for obedience,","knowing that this virtue is the shortest way to reach holiness                and  that  people  reach  their  goal  safely  by  living  under                obedience.  Since  God  delights  much  in  the obedient  souls,                He  blesses  them  with  special  graces  making  them  always                succeed; on the contrary, the disobedient ones are like a boat                without  rudder  never  reaching  the  harbor  because  God                leaves them in the power of their fool counsel. The example                of  Saul  who  was  reproved  by  God  for  one  disobedience  is                dreadful;  more  dreadful  is  the  example  of  our  first  parents                who ruined humankind by sinning against obedience. For that                reason  the  aspirant  who  is  indisposed  to  perfect  obedience                must leave this community not to harm the others by his bad                example (R.A.).                                2. PRACTICE OF OBEDIENCE                         Obedience  is  the  first  practical  rule  for  the  people                who  want  to  reach  perfection  and eternal  life.  This  virtue  is                precious  because  it  is  based  on  humility,  which  was  taught                and  practiced  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  by  the  most  holy   263                Virgin, and all the saints. Through this divine virtue, a person                dispossesses himself, surrendering to God, who will dispose                of him as he likes.                        Obedience is the safest way to reach Christian per-                fection, but it must be endowed with many qualities in order to                be  perfect.  First  it  must  be  interior.  It  follows  that  the                probationer  has  to  obey  for  God's  sake  imitating  our  Lord                Jesus  Christ,  regardless  of  external  convenience  or  ulterior                motive. Hence he has to see God in the superiors.                         When  a  person  obeys  with  self-denial,  he  makes  a                sacrifice  of  his  own  will,  deserving  more  merit.  We  must                remember that our Lord Jesus Christ obeyed up to the","death. Obedience is the death of selfishness, the sacrifice of                one's own will, and is painful.                         Obedience  must  be  blind.  Not  asking  nor  under-                standing the why of the orders belongs to blind obedience.                         Obedience must be ready; the more ready it is, the                more is meritorious. At the command of obedience everything                must be left such as a started work or a word that is being                written or a Gloria Patri that is being said.                      At last, obedience must be joyous because it is written: «                God  loves  the  one  who  gives  gladly  »  (2  Cor.  9,  7).  The                perfection of obedience consists in keeping in mind the rules,                the superior's orders and will, doing everything according to                them.                         Humble, interior obedience requires of us to conform                our  judgment  to  the  superiors'  judgment  when  we  carry  out                their order, holding their command as good as it is right even                when  it  appears  otherwise  to  us.  Besides  being  of  great   264                importance, renouncing one's own opinion pleases the Lord                and helps the soul so much.                         To crown his perfection an obedient person precedes                and carries out the superior's wishes. His spirit of obedience                somehow makes him obey even his fellow and subordinates.                         The  probationers  must  be  convinced  that  they  are                unable  to  please  God,  to  improve  their  virtues,  and  to                persevere  in  the  good,  unless  they  are  perfectly  obedient                (P.R.P.). (8)                         The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  love  holy                obedience:  blind,  ready,  joyous,  simple,  constant,  interior,                supernatural obedience; blind by obeying without seeking the                why; ready, without making any delay; joyous, following  the                orders  with  joy  and  sincerity,  even  when  aversion  is  felt;                simple, making no distortion or excuse; constant, performing","the obedience in due time and place, without having the order                repeated; interior, by approving and holding the command as                a  right  one  (except  sin);  and  supernatural,  by  obeying  for                supernatural motive. Unlike the soldiers who obey far fear of                punishment  and  unlike  the  employees  who obey  for  fear  of                the fines or of losing their job, the Religious obeys for God's                pure sake in order to please the adorable Heart of Jesus, to                be united with him, to attract This blessings, and to become                holy  and  rich  with  merits  and  virtues  when  the  celestial                spouse  will  call  her  to  the  celestial  wedding.  Obeying  by                supernatural  motives  requires  of  the  Religious  both  to  see                God's and the most holy Virgin in the superiors as well as to                see  God  and  the  most  holy  Virgin's  orders,  commands,                counsels,  exhortations,  and  wishes  in  the  superiors'  orders                (C.D.D.Z.).                         Our Lord Jesus Christ walked the path of obedience                to  death  -  his  death  on  the  cross  (Ph.  2,  8).  Each  of  his                actions was a perfect obedience to his Father and often to his                creatures will.                                                                          265                        How fortunate the obedient Religious is! She delights                the  Heart  of  Jesus,  and  God  disposes  of  her  as  He  likes                drawing  her  always  closer  to  Him.  The  saints  loved  obedi-                ence so much as to sacrifice themselves, while God some-                times worked miracles to help them obey. Let us be obedient,                and we will belong totally to God!                         St. Joseph Little Retreat novices will always consider                that  they  cannot  find  Jesus  entirely  according  to  the                novitiate's aim, unless they follow holy obedience, that every                soul walking out of holy obedience is astray, and that every                soul following holy obedience is on the way of divine union.                         The  virtue  of  holy  obedience  is  as  manifold  as                various:  it  must  be  practiced  with  the  superiors,  may  be                practiced","with  the  fellows,  and  even  with  the  subordinates.  Its                perfection consists in preceding and carrying out the orders                and the wishes of others. (9)                         To be perfect in holy obedience, the novice will prac-                tice  it  toward  God  and  the  Church  by  obeying  their  law;                toward the superiors, by obeying their orders, precepts, and                even counsels; toward the rules, by observing them exactly;                toward  the  fellows  and  the  subordinates,  by  practicing                obedience with prudence and discretion. By doing everything                in  the  spirit  of  obedience  the  novice  will  sanctify  and  make                meritorious her daily actions such as work, walk, eating, and                recreation.  Eating  or  drinking  between  meals  or  borrowing                things  will  be  done  with  the  superior's  permission.  Each                novice will hold herself as a slave of holy obedience and will                glory in it.                         The  novice  will  keep  in  mind  the  divine  example  of                Jesus who was obedient up to the death on the crass, and                now  is  obedient  to  his  creatures  in  the  Holy  Sacrament  as                well  as  the  example  of  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  who  is   266                teacher  model  of  perfect  obedience,  and  the  saints,                especially the glorious Patriarch St. Joseph (R.L.P.).                                        C. CHASTITY                         What  am  I  going to  say and  promise about  the  ob-                servance  of  the  notable  virtue  and  vow  of  chastity?  I                acknowledge that our Lord Jesus Christ brought this angelical                virtue on earth to his elect and to the fortunate souls he calls                out  of mercy  to  be  closer  to  him through  religious  life.  This                special grace lifts up the soul to the angelical rank and to the                mystical wedding with the immaculate lamb; the elect among                the thousands God calls","to  the  priesthood  or  to  the  religious  status  or  to  both                understand it.                         It  is  the  priest's  and  the  Religious'  sacred  duty  to                observe  this  virtue  and  vow;  even  breaking  it  venially  by                deliberate  consent  makes  them  grow  weak  in  the  other                virtues, makes the intellect dim, the spirit weak, but the devil                stronger  enough  to  tempt,  leading  the  people  to  total  ruin.                Consequently, if I am not pure in soul, body, mind, and heart I                will  not  be  humble,  obedient,  veracious,  and  observant  nor                will I be a priest or a Religious.                         A congregant who renounces chastity is unworthy of                remaining in the order, he rather deserves being driven out;                an  order  that  tolerates  such  a  rotted  member  or  an  order                where God is offended by such a sin, even though secretly, is                deteriorated before God. God would withdraw his blessings,                demon would rule, good principles would become depraved,                and all things would fall into ruin.                         I  promise  to  always  contemplate  the  preeminence   267                and the importance of chastity as well as to fervently implore                every day the mast holy heart of Jesus, Immaculate Mary, the                angels, the saints, and my guardian angel in order to prevent                chastity  from  the  least  stain.  Always  bearing  in  mind  the                psalmist's words: « God makes the angels His ministers, » as                a priest I will consider that I have been made an angel of holy                ministry because of chastity. As a Religious I will meditate on                the words of the Song of Solomon, « He pastures his flock                among the lilies, » that is to say, among the chaste souls as I                must be with God's help and my good will.                         In the presence of Jesus, our supreme goodness, the                most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  the  angels,  the  saints,  and  my  own                conscience  I  protest,  declare,  and  promise  to  cultivate                internal  and  external  chastity  till  the end  of my  life.  Internal                chastity, by keeping my mind and heart free from","fantasies, suggestions, and temptations as well as by always                more loving this angelical virtue. External chastity, by taking                care of my eyes and senses as well as by avoiding to deal                with  women  confidentially.  When  I  am  obliged  to  deal  with                them or with young girls, I will be reserved and self controlled                in my words, never looking at their face nor letting them kiss                my hand.                         The  pious  institute  of  Jesus'  Heart  is  made  of  the                Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal's orders, who                are separated and independent, but have relation of spiritual                assistance.  I,  however,  promise  to  never  go  to  the  sister                institute avoiding any connection with its congregants. If I am                told by obedience to go, I will take the necessary caution of                modesty and  words,  without  lengthening out  any relation  or                talk with other persons. At the end of the visit or relation I will                report everything to the superiors.                                 1. MOST PRECIOUS STONE                                                                          268                        Chastity!  This  is  the  virtue  that  leads  the  person  to                the evangelical perfection making him worthy of being united                with  God  according  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  saying:  «                Happy are the pure in heart; they will see God! » (Mt. 5, 8).                         This virtue is like a precious stone for this small com-                munity's probationers, who must be chaste and pure in their                thoughts, words, and actions (P.R.P.). (10)                         Since  the  Rogationists  of  Jesus'  Heart  are going  to                take  the  vow  of  this  angelical  virtue,  their  thoughts,  words,                and actions must be purest. To keep holy chastity safe, they                will be in the presence of God using the following means: 1)                Prayer  and  daily  meditation  on  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's                Passion; 2) mortification of the senses;","3)  not  staring  at  women  neither  lingering  with  them;  4)                avoidance  of  idleness  and  of  much  rest,  loving  work  and                sacrifice;  5)  being  sincere  in  the  holy  confession  without                neglecting  it;  6)  being  united  with  Jesus  in  the  daily  Holy                Communion;  7)  avoiding  talk  with  lay  people,  reading  of                newspapers, and the like; 8) never laying hands on people; 9)                praying many times a day to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary,                St.  Joseph, and  the  guardian  angel  in  order  to  observe  the                angelical virtue :perfectly (C.R.).                         To  keep  the  virtue  of  chastity  safe,  each  sister  will                love internal and external mortification, humility of heart and                humble  works,  modesty,  avoidance  of  curiosity,  silence,                prayer, and attendance of the holy sacraments. The humble,                contrite, and sincere confession is a most effective means to                keep the people pure, but the daily Communion received with                pure conscience, with feelings of love, due preparation, and                thanksgiving transforms the people in God.                         No one is allowed to lay hands on fellows and to form                a particular friendship (F.R.).                           269                         Chastity  is  the  most  precious,  shining  stone  of  the                virgin consecrated to Jesus, who is the spouse of the souls,                the eternal Word of God, eternally begotten of the Father in                the  splendor  of  infinite  virginity  and  divine  holiness.  He                pastures  among  the  lilies,  loving  the  chaste,  pure  soul.  To                become  a  man,  he  wanted  an  immaculate  mother;  to  be                buried, an undefiled sepulcher; to stay under the species of                spotless bread he wanted pure ministers for the consecration                of the Eucharist and pure, angelical brides for celestial love,                so unknown to the world and its followers. To be a Daughter                of Divine Zeal, one must be purest in order to light the divine                zeal in an immaculate heart. No one but those who are dead                to the senses and pure in their heart can feel the most","holy Heart of Jesus' interests, be perfumed in the innermost                of their soul, and say: « We are like a sweet-smelling incense                offered  by  Christ  to  God  »  (II  Cor.  2,  1)!  The  Daughter  of                Divine  Zeal  will  be  most  jealous  of  chastity!  She  will                understand its divine excellence, will love and consecrate it to                the sweetest Heart of Jesus, where she will contemplate and                preserve it jealously like a pearl of Jesus' Heart. She will have                a watchful care so that the lightest breath may not spoil this                most  precious  virtue,  knowing  that  the  vow  makes  it  more                brilliant and beautiful, but the least defect dims and defiles it                (F.R.).                         The  beautiful  virtue of  chastity makes  the  creatures                like angels. The more a soul is chaste, the more it is spiritual;                the more imperfect it is in this virtue, the more imperfect it is                in the other ones. Jesus said: « Happy are the pure in heart;                they  will  see  God!  »  The  Little  Retreat  novice  will  take                watchful  care  of  her  soul  preserving  her  heart  jealously                through  modesty,  retreat,  prayer,  mortification,  weekly                confession,  and  daily  Communion,  which  makes  the  virgins                flourish. Each novice will refrain both from curiosity and much   270                talk keeping her eyes cast down and mortified, as much as                she can. Keeping her heart free from creatures, she will avoid                intimacy with everyone, loving all the people in God. Laying                hands on people is not allowed to the novices (R.L.P.).                       D. THE FOURTH VOW: ZEAL FOR THE ROGATE                         The novices long to make the vow of praying to the                most holy Heart of Jesus that he will send out good workers                to  the  holy  Church.  For  such  a  purpose  they  will  combine                prayer with works.                         1. Prayer. They will pray:","a. Three times a day, in common.                         b.  Four  times  a  year,  during  the  Rogation  Days                making the procession in the open. They will also pray to the                apostles on their feast and to the Holy Sacrament during the                exposition.                         c. To win good workers, they will offer every day the                holy mass, the rosary, Holy Communion, their pains, and the                good works in union with the zeal of Jesus, who said: « Pray,                therefore,» etc.                         d. Each novice will pray in the secret of her heart all                day  long  to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church,  adding                offerings,  ejaculatory  prayers,  intentions,  mortifications,  and                everything her zeal will suggest.                      2. Works: the Little Poor of Jesus' Heart novices will be                trained  in  different  works  regarding  their  community's                well-proceeding  and  in  charity  toward  the  orphans  and  the                spoor clerics. To please the most holy Heart of Jesus and to   271                grow in holiness, they will apply themselves to various jabs                with accuracy, practicing charity toward the orphans as much                as obedience allows. To help the poor clerics, the novices will                work and beg to obtain some income for them (R.L.P.). (11)                         The fourth vow: zeal for winning good workers to the                holy Church. Because this vow implies the best exercises to                faster  divine  glory  and  salvation  of  souls,  it  embraces                everything (C.P.).                         A secret for the salvation of the Church and society is                concealed in the practice of this divine command (C.R.).                         The spirit of our institute is the zeal for the Heart of                Jesus'  interests  that  are  abridged  in  the  words  «  pray,                therefore », etc. Because all goods on earth proceed from the                priesthood, by imploring good workers to the holy Church we                aim at fostering the most holy Heart of","Jesus' interests, who declared that the zeal for God's house                was  consuming  him.  Now,  God's  house  is  the  universal                Church  and  Jesus'  Heart  is  burning  with  desire  to  see  all                souls entering this mystical ark of salvation. Oh! How much                we  should  strive  to  become  holy  for  the  divine  mission  of                fostering the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests (R.R.C.).                         The  zeal  for  the  glory  of  God  and  for  the  good  of                souls  must  be  predominant  in  the  Rogationists  of  Jesus'                Heart,  because  they  have  the  mission  of  winning  good                workers to the holy Church from his Heart.                         Each  Rogationist  will  pick  up  from  Jesus  Christ's                adorable mouth the divine command « pray, therefore, » etc.,                which is the outcome of his divine zeal, and will consider its                singular  importance  at  the  present  time  for  facing  the  evils                which are afflicting the holy Church by lack of holy vocations.                To  make  the  people  know  this  divine  command  and  this                beneficial  devotion  each  Rogationist  will  do  his  best,  being                himself one with Jesus in his burning thirst for the salvation of                souls. Such a burning desire afflicted him from the time of his   272                incarnation making him exclaim on the cross: « I am thirsty! »                (C.R.).                         The  obedience  to  this  divine  command  forms  the                favorite joy, the chief point of the Daughters of Divine Zeal's                vocation, mission, and glorious predestination (C.D.D.Z.).                         Their  zeal for  this daily  prayer  will  be  always  active                and increasing: they will understand its importance in the light                of faith, will always keep in their mind our Lord Jesus Christ's                command, will consider the immense good deriving from it as                well as the merits which accumulate in time and eternity. In                time they will share abundantly in the works of the priests; in                eternity they will share in their glory, which is the highest one.                They will be the","wise  virgins,  whose  lamp  will  not  die  out  here,  but  will  be                transformed  in  the  light  of  the  highest  priest  over  there.                Through this zeal and prayer as well as through the spiritual                fecundity of the perpetual virginity, the wise virgin bride of the                virgins' king will somehow become mother of Jesus Christ's                priesthood in the Church. Oh! If the Daughter of Divine Zeal                answers and understands her vocation according to the spirit,                she has a great vocation (F.R.)!                                            NOTES                      (1)  In 1918 things changed, because Canon Law defined exactly                the simple vow's nature. The  importance of the vow of  poverty  is well                known from our constitutions.                    (2)  The   religious   holy   poverty   is   a  fundamental   vow   for                the congregants, and they  must hold  it  as a greatest  treasure  and  as                the  basis  of  the  order's  existence  and  progress.  The  more  the  order                holds in esteem and  practices poverty, the more the order will  be firm,                blessed, and improved by God (C.R.).                      273                    «The Rogationists will possess no property in act, nor will they say                mine,  referring  to  things  they  use,  they  will  say  instead  the  room,  the                clothes I use, and the like having no thing in secret, not even a cotton                thread.  They  will  be  fond  of  asking  for  the  humblest  suit,  the  worst                shoes, and the poorest things in holy emulation » (C.R.).                    (3)  The Daughter of Divine Zeal will love holy poverty very much                holding  it as the great treasure  left by  Jesus  Christ our  Lord  to his                true followers, to the beloved souls. The Daughter of Divine Zeal's heart                will get married with holy  poverty, being fond of and glorying in it, for                Jesus and the most holy Virgin loved it very much (F.R.).                    (4)  No   mother   superior   will   act   the   gallant.   The   necessary                objects will be of the lowest grade, excepted the  ones for the use of                noble  guests.  Do not  say  that  some things  are  cheaper because they                last  more;  even  those  of  low  grade  may  last  if  they  are  given careful                attention.  It   is  also  of  no  avail   saying  that  some  elegant","things are given free. We must avoid the devil's snare. Sometimes                we have to renounce such gifts, and when courtesy obliges us to receive                them, we can sell the marketable ones, putting the others in the guest                rooms,  or  reserving  them  for  the  noble  persons,  but  never  for  the                Religious» (S.D.D.Z.).                    (5)  In our padre's  times,  money  had  different  value.                    (6)   « So that the aspirant's obedience may be meritorious before                God it must be external and internal, that is to say, it must be done for                the Lord's sake in  order to please God, gain  merits  for eternal life,  and                attract    divine    blessings.    We      must    obey    in    spirit    of    faith,                considering  God's  will   to   be  in  that  of  the   superior,   and   holding                that      obedience      sanctifies      all      actions,      even      the      most                indifferent» (R.A.).                    (7)   Blessed   be the  daughters   that  for Jesus'  sake   consecrate                themselves to holy obedience. They will be the dearest ones to Jesus                and Mary and will reach perfection quickly (D.S.S.).                    (8)   «Obedience!  This  is  the  great virtue  that  the aspirant will                practice to become dear to God and to the people, as well as to be worth                advancing in the religious life. The aspirant's obedience must be ready,                blind, joyous, and faithful.                    Ready,  without  delay;  blind,  without  thinking  over  it,  because  the                devil enters the reasoning about obedience and drives to transgression;                joyous, means obedience with no aversion or agitation; faithful, means                that the superior's order must be carried out punctually, and in the best   274                way, as long as the order lasts. The aspirants will pay careful attention in                order  that  their  obedience  be  always  faithful  and  endowed  with  the                qualifications mentioned above, preventing it from becoming short-lived                or useless; only by doing so they will get used to this beautiful virtues                (R.A.).

Holy mortification of gluttony is of great importance,                and  I  will fast  and abstain  perfectly  as  the  holy  Church                commands:  if  health  reasons  or  anything  else  prevent                me from doing so, I will submit my case to the superiors                with  simplicity  and  will  follow  their  opinion.  I  will  also                behave so about common food.                                                                          275                    As to the other mortifications and penances, such as                those we do on the first Friday of the month or in special                circumstances of the year or in the months of May and                June, and in the novenas, as well as the nightly vigils of                about an hour, the silence by rule, the service to the poor                along  with  the  washing  of  their  feet,  the  whip,  and  the                use of penance tools once or twice a week, I will follow                the community's customs. Such penances, however, may                be replaced for good reasons. Furthermore, I declare that                I  am  ready  to  accept  any  penance when I  am  punished                for my faults.                     So  that  the  community  may  proceed  well,  everyone                has  to  observe  the  schedule  of  the  acts  in  common.                Beginning with the reveille In the morning, I promise to                be punctual when the bell chimes the hour for the prayer,                refectory,  spiritual  reading,  going  out,  recreation,  and                sleep,  never  exempting  myself  of  my  own  will.  When  I                have to be absent,","I will do so with the superior's expressed or presumed per-                mission.                    I  recognize  the  Importance  of  regular  discipline.  My                staying  and  behaving  in  community  will  be  unlike  my  be-                having in the world or in the family or among the seculars;                therefore,  I  will  pay  the  attention  and  the  caution  we  are                obliged to use by the institute's rules, by the promises and                declarations I have endorsed, by the mutual good example,                and by the edification we have to give to the little, simple-                minded people who live with us. To begin with, I will keep                silence  according  to  the  rules  and  to  the  customs  of  the                house, saying few, wise words when I have to talk. Second,                usually I will speak Italian (I will only speak dialect when it is                necessary  to  make  me  better-understood  by  the  poor  and                children),  avoiding  gossip,  criticism,  anger,  and  reproach                against the people who are not under my jurisdiction.                    While staying among children, brothers, and outsiders I                will  pay  careful  attention  to  restrain  myself  from  relating                worldly,  useless,  shocking,  frivolous,  Idle  things,  or  news                about crime, suicide, and the like which feed or excite cu-                riosity.  Likewise,  I  will  refrain  from  complaining  about                personal facts, food, service or events and troubles of the   276                Institute  or  anything  else;  furthermore,  when  the  hearers                might be surprised and shocked, I will not even complain in                the presence of my brethren. Since I am entitled to relate to                the superiors, when it is worth while I will do so with humil-                ity, meekness, and simplicity.                    I will be unaffectedly neat as much as it is consistent                with  evangelical  poverty,  hating  the  intention  of  cutting  a                good figure.                                        1. SILENCE                     The sisters are warmly recommended to avoid any chat,                to be haters of idle talk, and to avoid useless words, keeping                silence all day long except at play, where they will be modest                and  self-possessed  to  set  good  example  to  the  children.  If                they love silence, keeping it while","working, they will produce, otherwise they lose time. Silence!                Silence! Silence (S.I.G.)!                      Holy silence is indispensable to keep order, to cultivate                holy  virtues,  and  to  observe  the  rules.  Holy  Scripture  says                that the spirit is strengthened by silence: « Your salvation lay                in conversion and tranquility, your strength, in complete trust                »  (Is.  30,  15).  On  the  contrary, «  A  flood  of  words  is  never                without its fault » (Prov. 10, 19); and, « The man who talks                too much will get himself disliked » (Eccl. 20, 8); as well as, «                Happy the man who has never sinned with his tongue » (Eccl.                25, 11). Holy silence was always kept by the communities of                perfect observance.                      The probationers will rigorously observe the rules about                moderate and perfect silence. Perfect silence will be kept in                religious  acts,  study,  refectory,  and  dormitory.  For  the                remainder silence will be moderate, and the people will speak                in  a  love  voice,  with  a  few  words  when  they  need  to  say                something (P.R.P.).                                                                          277                     Silence  is  the  guardian  of  holy  prayer.  Since  it  is                exceedingly  important  for  the  community's  well-proceeding,                the novices will observe it exactly with God's help. Normally,                they  will  not  speak  too  loud  nor  burst  out  laughing.  At  play                there is no silence (R.L.P.).                      Like  the  observant  communities,  the  sisters  will  pay                careful attention to the rule of silence, keeping moderate and                perfect  silence:  perfect,  from  reveille  to  after-mass,  in  the                refectory,  and  in  the  dormitory  at  night;  moderate,  during                work-time. During perfect silence, no word is to be said, and                when the sisters need to speak they will do so in low voice.                They  will  keep  moderate  silence  by  talking  in  a  low  voice,                being  silent  the  most  they  can...  Let  us  remember  that  the                Lord said that we have to give an account of even a useless                word, that Jesus speaks to the","souls in silence, and silence strengthens the spirit making the                people avoid many faults (D.S.S.).                      Discipline  requires  silence.  A  community  of  freely                speaking, backbiting people is a fuss, a confusion, a disorder,                where  neither  rule  nor  peace  nor  piety  nor  education  can                reign.  On  the  contrary,  when  silence  stands  out  in  a                community,  everything  proceeds  well;  there,  grumbling,                useless  words,  and  defects  cannot  find  their  way.  The                institutes' rules and the observant communities hold silence                in great esteem, because it helps the people by concentrating                their attention, by controlling their desires, and by mortifying                their  heart;  furthermore,  it  keeps  their  soul  in  the  divine                presence,  fosters  a  calm  and  gentle  spirit,  and  preserves                virtues.  Those  who  accustom  themselves  to  silence  are                worthy  to  hear  God  speaking  to  their  heart.  Holy  Scripture                often praises silence, but condemns excessive talk. If silence                is  indispensable  to  any  community,  at  greater  reason  it  is                indispensable to a community of youths. The point of fact is                that  to  grow  wise,  considerate,  pious,  and  recollected,  they                need  to  bridle  their  tongue,  for  the  unbridled  people  grow   278                thoughtless and inconsiderate (R.A.).                      The rule of silence allows no grumbling, no fault finding,                no  slander,  and  no  useless  words.  To  accustom  oneself  to                the  beautiful  virtue  of  keeping  silence  it  is  of  importance  to                also keep it interiorly (C.R.).                      Keeping silence is a main rule of a religious community                which allows the people to avoid many defects and to hear                the Lord's sweet inspirations in their heart; for that reason I                resolve  to  keep  moderate  and  perfect  silence  faithfully  and                exactly.  Unsatisfied  by  external  silence,  I  will  also  keep                internal  silence  by  bridling  my  mind  when  selfishness                penetrates my internal thoughts to the prejudice of patience,                meekness, humility, obedience","and  charity.  I  will  also  restrain  my  curiosity  from  knowing,                hearing,  and  interfering  with  matters  which  are  none  of  my                business (P.D.).                      Since most defects and disorders come from the tongue                and « death and life are in the gift of the tongue » (Prov. 18,                21);  I  will  pay  special  attention  to  bridle  my  tongue  in                everything. I will not speak of myself proudly nor will I relate                useless,  distracting  and  unbecoming  things,  nor  will  I                backbite. I will not complain about anybody, especially about                the  institute's  members,  nor  will  I  censure  nor  find  out  the                defects of others, nor discuss my worldly life, nor will I fight to                uphold  my  opinions.  Avoiding  harsh  words  even  to  my                younger  mates,  I  will  speak  with  the  older  members  with                humble, pious, and respectful words. Bearing in my mind the                Holy  Spirit's  saying:  «  It  is  convenient  to  wait  in  silence  for                God's  help  »  (D.  1907),  I  will  perfectly  observe  the  silence                prescribed by the rule.                               2. VARIOUS MORTIFICATIONS                    279                      The  teacher  will  test  the  novices  in  many  ways  about                humility, obedience, mortification, and sacrifice, and they will                receive everything with spiritual pleasure in order to become                acceptable to the celestial spouse, to destroy their bad habits,                and to atone for their past sins. The novices must be told to                practice  obedience,  mortification,  and  sacrifice  with  holy                simplicity and sincerity.                      As saber souls, they will not seek satisfaction in eating                nor will they eat two different kinds of fruit, but will eat and                drink as much as is sufficient, taking their time. As penitent                souls,  they  will  love  mortification,  humiliation,  and  penance,                which  are  so  much  hated  by  the  blind  world,  but  so  much                loved by the saints. (1)","The  Little  Retreat  novices  will  love  penance  with                particular  affection  because  it  mortifies  the  passions,  but                enlivens the spirit. No penance, especially cilice, whip, fast,                and the like is allowed to the novices without the permission                of holy obedience. They are told to practice the penances and                the mortifications the fathers of spirit suggest, because such                penances destroy the natural defects without harming health,                sometimes helping it, instead.                      The  mortifications  we  are  talking  about  are:  1)  ab-                stinence from sweets, which are nothing else than a stimulus                of  throat,  which  the  spiritual  persons  avoid;  2)  partial                abstinence from fruit on certain days; 3) habitual abstinence                from  eating  and  drinking  between  meals;  4)  feeding  on                leftovers,  which  helps  humility,  but  destroys  gluttony;  this                mortification,  however,  is  allowed  now  and  then  to  the                novices who ask for it; 5) keeping perfect or moderate silence                when  talk  is  allowed,  or  mortifying  the  eyes  or  renouncing                play-time.  Such  penances  can  be  used  fruitfully  with  the                superior's permission. Taking of a cup of coffee or milk or any                drink  without  sugar  or  eating  a  dish  of  flood  or  fish  or  any   280                soup  without  seasoning  falls  in  the  same  kind  of  penance.                When  the  novice,  however,  may  appear  singular  for  doing                much mortifications, she must avoid them (R.L.P.).                      Neither the sisters are allowed to do bodily penances nor                the  superiors  are  empowered  to  give  such  a  permission.                Those in goad health will fast according to the holy Church's                law.  Little  mortifications  that  pass  unknown  to  the  people,                such  as  drinking  less  than  to  one's  fill,  delaying  a  drink,                enduring  a  midge,  wearing  a  dress  of  poor quality,  and  the                like,  are  helpful  to  the  spirit  and  are  allowed.  The  true                penance consists in the practice of the interior virtues such as                humbly confessing one's own","faults,  restraining  and  overcoming  oneself,  keeping  oneself                pure, enduring the troubles, suffering and loving the fellows                and  the  pupils,  depending  on  the  superior's  will,  and                sacrificing  oneself  for  Jesus,  our  supreme  good,  and  the                souls (D.S.S.).                      Even  when  the  confessor  permits  a  grave  penance,  it                cannot  be  performed  without  the  superior's  permission.  But                the little penances that pass unknown to the community are                allowed;  they  are  effective  without  feeding  self-esteem                (P.R.P.).                      The congregants will fast according to the holy Church's                law,  and  when  they  need  dispensation,  they  will  ask  the                superior  for  it.  No  one  is  allowed  to  do  excessive  voluntary                penances without the superior's permission, but each one will                embrace  suffering,  mortifications,  contradictions,  sickness,                nuisance,  and  anything  else  coming  from  the  reigning  or                permitting will of God as beneficial and holy penances. They                will  endure  them  with  great  love  and  holy  joy,  at  least  by                intellect and will. It is also a beneficial penance any work that   281                the people accomplish for the service of God and neighbor.                Each  of  them  will  practice  the  little mortification  which  pass                unknown  to  the  people,  such  as  expressing  no  complaint                about food, mortifying gluttony in secret, restraining from talk,                and the like which so many authors suggest. Everyone will be                favorably  disposed  to  suffer  far  the  service of  God  and  the                good  of  souls  the  inconveniences  of  holy  poverty,  any                discomfort and sacrifice such as hunger, thirst, lack of sleep                and  rest.  On  Immaculate  Mary's  and  Assumption’s  eve  the                fast by eating bread only is allowed. On Holy Friday we are                accustomed to kneel while eating the amount of food which is                allowed  by  fast.  On  the  eve  of  various  feasts  and  in  other                circumstances, we keep the vigil in the church for about an                hour praying according","ing to the superior's dispositions; no one can exempt himself                without having the superior's permission (C.R.).                                3. VOLUNTARY PENANCES                     The Daughters of Divine Zeal will love, wish, and esteem                the  voluntary  penances  which  foster  divine  love  and  holy                virtues,  purify  the  souls  from  past  faults,  expiate  pain  on                earth, and lighten purgatory's pain when they are performed                with  pure  intention.  They  also  stimulate  the  souls  to  reach                perfection,  accustoming  them to  suffering, mortification,  and                destruction  of  selfishness.  Besides,  when  a  sister  exhorts                herself  to  do  bodily  penance  with  the  only  aim  at  pleasing                God  and  achieving  holy  perfection,  she  heartens  herself  to                improve her virtues and to love the cross. Those who despise                or under-value the bodily penances by saying that the interior                ones are enough, do not show true spirit nor wisdom, nor the                science of the saints; they only show that they are not striving                to achieve interior virtues.                     We must bear in mind our Lord Jesus Christ's saying: « I   282                tell you that if you do not turn from your sins, you will all die                as they did » (Lk. 13, 5) and the triple cry about penance that                the most holy Virgin said through Bernadette’s mouth at the                Lourdes  grotto,  «  Penance,  penance,  penance!  »  It  is  true                that  our  Lord's  word  is  mainly  concerned  with  internal                penance  and  with  repentance  for  sins  which  our  Lord                elevated  to  a  sacrament:  the  humble,  sincere,  contrite                confession  to  his  minister  in  the  priceless,  most  merciful                tribunal  of  reconciliation.  Nevertheless,  God's  word  has  a                wider sense; when he talked about penance, he also meant                the voluntary one which the person who is called to perfection                performs in order to reach her vocation goal; otherwise, she","misses the religious perfection, jeopardizing her spirit through                enfeeblement of repentance and resolve, and running the risk                of  losing  the  spirit,  her  vocation,  and  eternal  salvation.  For                that  reason  each  sister  will  esteem  bodily  penances,                performing them in obedience to the rule and with discretion                in order that they may be helpful.                      The  mother  superior  will  moderate  and  control  the                voluntary penances, keeping in mind:                     a.  Sister's  health,  work,  and  job.  The  first  penance  a                sister must offer to the Lord is the work she is doing in the                community as perfectly as she can: for instance, getting up in                the  night  from  necessity,  traveling  by  obedience,  washing,                sweeping,  writing,  embroidering,  supervising,  being  hungry,                thirsty,  tired,  and  enduring  incidents  when  things  and  the                community require so.                      b. The mother superior will also look at the improvement                in the virtues of obedience, humility, zeal, and accuracy while                the  sisters  perform  their  own  duty  or  when  they  renounce                their own will and opinion, etc. Some souls happen to deceive   283                themselves  through  bodily  penances;  they  are  able  to  do                hardest  bodily  penances  without  hesitating  to  break  holy                obedience,  humility,  charity,  fulfillment  of  their  duty,  etc.                These  souls  consider  themselves  saints  for  their  bodily                penances,  but  persist  in  the  bad  practice  of  the  virtues                becoming  obstinate,  somehow  stubborn,  negligent,  angry,                etc.  Depriving  them  of  their  voluntary  whimsical  penances                and inflicting other penances, helps them. If they are willing to                amend their vices in order to achieve holy virtues, they may                be  allowed  to  perform  voluntary  penances  with  discretion;                they,  however,  must  be  told  to  offer  their  penances  to  the                Lord with the aim at amending their bad habit and improving                religious virtues; otherwise, they will be forbidden to perform                voluntary        penances          (S.D.D.Z.).       (2)","4. NIGHTLY PRAYER                      We  are  going  to  say  something  about  the  merit  and                efficacy of nightly prayer. The saints held the nightly prayer in                great esteem, practiced it all their life, and obtained copious                graces  and  celestial  favors  for  themselves  and  the  whole                Church. Even though our. Lord Jesus Christ had no need to                pray, still he spent entire nights praying on the mountains, in                the  caves  or  while  traveling;  hence,  the  saints  loved  the                nightly  prayer,  and  the  sacred  writers  praised  and                recommended  it.  Some  founders  laid  down  the  rule  which                required arising in the night to say the divine office: this the                Capuchins, the Theresians, and other sisters also practice. If                our community of active life is unable to do that every night,                still we should follow our custom of keeping some vigils in the                night during the year as we did since the institute's origin.                      These vigils are:                      1. The night between the old and the new year. This vigil                lasts  about  90  minutes.  We  enter  the  church  45  minutes   284                before midnight and go out 45 minutes after midnight: In the                first phase we thank God, the adorable our Lord Jesus Christ,                the most holy Virgin, St. Joseph, St. Michael the archangel,                St.  Anthony  of  Padua,  the  guardian  angels,  and  the  patron                saints  for  the  spiritual  and  temporal  graces  they  granted                during the year past. In the second phase, we start the new                year by praising and blessing God. This holy practice in the                pious institute of the Heart of Jesus' interests is called the first                fruits, which are the beginning of the new year, the praise, the                blessing, and other prayers of our prayer book.                      2. One or two vigils in the holy week.","3. On the night of Sept. 8 we keep the vigil for the most                holy Mary's nativity, the celestial bambinella. By spirit we go                around  St.  Anne's  house  praying  for  about  30-45  minutes                before her birth at midnight. Then, we enter the house to see                the Bambinella in the arms of her fortunate parents, St. Anne                and  St.  Joachim.  Kneeling  and  reverent,  we  admire  the                celestial  bambinella,  praise  her  glories,  and  renew  the                celestial slavery of love imploring graces.                      4. On Immaculate Conception's eve, we begin the vigil                at  about  30-45  minutes  before  midnight  owing  to  the                people's  belief  that  the  most  holy  Virgin's  immaculate  soul                was  created  and  infused  in  her  immaculate  body  at  12:00                midnight sharp.                      At  12:00  midnight  sharp,  we  praise  the  immaculate                bambinella  who  is  in  her  mother's  womb;  then  we  join  the                adoration,  the  acts  of  charity  and  virtue  that  the  celestial                bambinella  offered  to  the Most  High, her  Creator  and  Lord,                from the beginning of her life. Keeping company together with   285                her  thousand  guardian  angels  headed  by  St.  Gabriel  the                archangel, we honor and offer ourselves to her through the                sacred  slavery  of  love,  asking  for  graces  and  giving  our                thanksgiving.                      5. On the beautiful happy night of Christmas, our most                adorable  sweet  baby  Jesus'  birthday,  we  keep  awake  to                prepare ourselves through a thrill of loving expectation in the                Bethlehem's grotto, where we are in spirit. We renew our filial                slavery of love toward the baby through a specific prayer. On                this  most  loving  night,  we  may  hear  one  or  two  or  three                masses,  receiving  the  most  Holy  Communion  with  the  best                dispositions  of  love  and  faith  in  order  that  the  baby  Jesus'                mystical birthday may come true in each heart.","6.  When  we  are  waiting  for  urgent  graces  for  fear  of                divine  punishments,  when  human  persecutions  stirred  by                demon  are  pressing,  it  is  always  right  to  have  recourse  to                nightly prayer through special vigils.                      7. If a sister feels drawn to pray in the night and is able                to do so without being sleepy during the daily jab or prayer,                she  can  ask  the  permission  from  the  mother  superior,  who                may  grant  it  with  discretion.  Happy  and  acceptable  to  the                Lord  is  the  sister  who  prays  in  the  night  before  the  Holy                Sacrament  to  keep  Jesus  company,  to  talk  with  him  tête  à                tête, to implore his divine mercies for her and the houses, for                the sisters and the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests. Those                who  feel  this  impulse  may  follow  it  with  the  superior's                approval. Till the sister gets used to it, she may happen to be                sleepy;  that,  however,  will  not  prevent  her  from  insisting,                because as long as the sister has pure intention and makes                efforts following holy obedience, the Lord will help her in the                night prayer.                      8. Ordering other vigils during the year depends on the   286                mother  superior  general.  During  the  vigils,  the  houses'                communities  will  be  united  in  spirit  in  order  to  form  one                spiritual  community.  At  the  end  of  the  vigil,  the  souls  in                Purgatory will be also remembered through some prayer. To                keep the nightly peace, all the people will be perfectly silent                before and after the vigil (S.D.D.Z.).                                            NOTES                     (1)  The  categories  of  penances  are  4:  determined,  imposed,                voluntary, and disciplinary penances.                    a)  Determined  penances  are  fast,  discipline,  and  sackloth  in  the                days established by the rule as well as the 7 Glory to the","Father  along  with  the  ejaculatory  prayer:  we  greet  you,  o                immaculate blood etc., which we say with raised arms in the evening.                    b)  Imposed   penances   are   the   ones   that   the   mother                superior  imposes  to  the  novices'  community  or  to  the  individuals  for                practice  of  mortification  or  for  test,  even  when  the  novices  are  not  at                fault.                    c)    Disciplinary    penances  are  the  ones  that  the  mother  superior                imposes even wtien  the faults are light ones.                    d)  Voluntary penances are the ones that the individuals do with the                mother superior's  permission, following their fervor.                    The  sick  people  and  those  of  delicate  constitution  may  humbly                expose  their  situation  to  the  mother  superior,  following  her  decision.                However, if they are granted special help and dispensation, they have to                practice  humility  and  obedience  to  counterbalance  the  dispensation                (R.N.).                    (2) Saying specific prayer with the hands under the knees or with                arms raised appears often in the primal rules; following upon, the prayer                with raised hands remained for the 7 Glory to the Most Precious Blood,                the  daily  Our  Father  to  St  Antony,  and  the  5  Our  Fathers  on  the  first                Friday  of  month;  about  the  hands  under  the  knees,  we  read  the  last                writing by the padre: « Doing penance by putting the hands under the                knees is not allowed» (S.D.D.Z.).                                                                           287","288","CHAPTER IX                                RECEIVING CORRECTIONS                     If  ever  the  superiors  warn  or  admonish  me  for  my                faults, I will receive their warnings and admonitions with                humility of heart and with all my soul, without justifying                myself  or  arguing  about  It;  on  the  contrary,  I  will                acknowledge my fault with humble, simple heart and will                amend. If I am not aware of the fault, I will consider my                being  unable  to  see  it  as  due  to  my  selfishness  which                has dimmed my sight, and, therefore, I need to humiliate                myself twice in my heart. If I am sure I have not fallen into                the fault I am charged with, for humility and prudence's                sake I will keep silence or I will justify myself calmly and                with simplicity once or twice.                        1. PRACTICE OF HUMILITY AND MORTIFICATION             289                      When  the  superior  warns,  or  admonishes,  or  inflicts  a                penance  to  someone,  the  subject  will  receive  and  execute                everything  with  humble  heart,  without  internal  and  external                remonstrances, even if he feels undeserving of it, attributing                such a feeling to selfishness (C.R.).                      The  mother  superior  may  inflict  little  penances  or                disciplinary  mortifications  for  external  faults,  and  the  culprit                has to receive and execute them with humility, adding internal                acts  of  virtue.  Such  penances  may  be  kneeling  in  the                refectory  or  kissing  the  earth  or  saying  some  prayers  with                raised  hands  or  begging  pardon  while  kneeling  in  the                refectory, and the like (D.S.S.). (1)","To amend and to atone on earth for the faults they would                expiate  in  purgatory  amidst  burning  fire,  the  novices  will                practice penances for their daily faults. The mother superior                will diversify the penances according to quality and number of                defects,  and  the  novices  will  execute  them.  The  mother                superior  will  also  see  that  penances  be  fitting  for  the  faults                and suitable for expiation and emendation (R.L.P.).                      The  aspirant  will  humbly  receive  the  penances  or                punishments which the superiors inflict for his faults against                the  rules,  considering  himself  deserving  of  them;  he  will                execute them exactly without protesting, and at the end of the                penance  will  go  to  the  superior  to  thank  him  and  to  beg                pardon.                      The youths who long for sanctification and admittance to                the religious community must be ready to receive penances                and punishments even for small faults, always being glad to                amend more and more (R.A.). (2)                      Following the exhortation of the apostle we have to strive   290                in  order  to  become  humble  and  to  abate  ourselves  without                undervaluing  anyone.  But,  if  we  happen  to  sadden  our                fellows,  we  have  to  beg  pardon,  humbling  ourselves.  We                must  accept  reproofs,  reprimands,  and  penances  with                humility,  avoiding  justifying  ourselves,  since  the  upright                person  begins  his  talk  by  charging  himself.  Let  us  endure                want,  affliction,  contradictions,  lack  of  food,  clothes,  and                everything,  considering  how  much  Christ,  his  most  holy                mother, and the patron saints suffered for us (R.R.C.).                      If  the  probationers  happen  to  fall  in  same  defect,  they                will  receive  willingly  the  penances  that  the  superiors  inflict.                Such  penances  will  be  proportionate  to  the  faults,  and  the                probationers will accept them with humility and mortification,                thinking of deserving them. Who receives corrections shows                that 'he is a simple-minded person","well  disposed  to  virtue;  on  the  contrary,  who  refuses                corrections shows that he is a proud, incorrigible person.                      We  warmly  exhort  the  probationers  to  humble  them-                selves interiorly when they are corrected, and to accept the                punishment  as  deserving  of  it;  otherwise  selfishness  will                deceive  them.  The  probationer  who  longs  for  religious  life                recognizes his failure every time he is corrected; if he did not,                he would be unable to improve virtue, and his vocation would                appear fallacious. Let us remember the words of the psalmist:                « A virtuous man may strike me in reproof for my own good,                but a wicked one shall never anoint my head with oil » (Ps.                141, 5) (P.R.P.).                                2. HARD TASK: CORRECTION                      Correcting his subjects' defects is a hardest task for the                superior. The more this task is of importance, the harder it is                when the superior undertakes it without appropriate caution,                because he may fail and harm, instead of correcting.      291                      Nothing is so delicate as correcting. Correcting is like a                drug; when its dose is wrong or the drug itself is mistaken it                may  be  poison  or  at  least  dangerous.  For  instance,  if  you                reproach  when  a  reserved  judgment  should  be  enough,  or                you  scold  when  a  sweet  word  is  needed,  it  is  like                administering  a  wrong  drug,  which  is  harmful  instead  of                healing.  Oh,  how  much  ruin  the  wrong  corrections  bring                about! To perform his duty well, therefore, the superior must                diagnose the defects.                      First,  he  has  to  understand,  know,  value,  and  be  fully                aware  of his  subjects'  defects  by  resorting  to  prayer,  divine                enlightenment,  and  careful  attention.  He  has  to  spiritually                diagnose each subject in order to understand the roots of the                defects, for they are different from person to person; some of                the roots are deeper, others shallow;","here,  there  is  more  malice,  there,  more  weakness  and  fra-                gility.  The  understanding  of  various  individuals'  defects  is                indispensable for the application of remedies.                      To understand the individuals with their defects, nature,                and character, so as to apply the right remedy, each superior                will pray insistently to God to obtain enlightenment. The daily                prayer  must  be  said  in  each  particular  case  through  an                intimate invocation upon the Lord, when correction is needed.                Our  daily  prayer  to  the  Lord  and  the  most  holy  Virgin  for                helping us in dealing with subjects reaches its aim when we                pray for particular cases, especially when we are responsible                for the people and ask for enlightenment. In such cases our                Lord  cannot  help  but  grant  it  success.  But,  if  the  superiors                neglect the remote  and the immediate prayer, they will lack                enlightenment and become unworthy of it. The superior must                pray continuously to win enlightenment on how to guide the                community and the individuals. In particular cases, when the                matter  is  urgent,  he  will  pray  interiorly,  even  for  a  moment                before acting.                                                                          292                     He  will  also  pray  to  win  enlightenment  about  how  to                correct  the  faulty  subject.  Sometimes,  correction  may  be                made  immediately  through  admonition;  warning,  or  repri-                mand;  sometimes,  it  may  not;  besides  time  and  prayer,                counsel  may  be  also  needed.  The  superior  needs  first  to                reflect  on  the  nature  of  the  fault, degree  of culpability,  etc.;                second, he has to find out the right remedy; third, the subject                too  needs  time  to  be  more  prone  to  accept  correction.  To                make the correction beneficial, the superior will let the subject                know his fault, will pray, and will tell other people to pray for it,                if necessary.                      Even  though  the  superior  may  dissimulate  some  small                defects along with some concealed reactions of his subjects,                he    must   correct   the   defects   at   their   rising.","3. ZEAL, NOT ANGER                      The superior will beware of correcting under the impulse                of anger or indignation, avoiding to offend the subject or his                parents by talking, for instance, about his  poverty, low birth,                etc., because it hurts. When the superior becomes angry, he                needs  to  restrain  himself,  cooling  dawn  and  delaying  the                correction. Ecclesiasticus says that in anger people say many                words  that  later  they  find  unjust.  Sometimes,  however,  the                superior  may  correct  in  a  somewhat  loud  voice  if  zeal                requires it. But true zeal requires that the superior be devoutly                indignant,  self-controlled,  worried  for  God's  glory  and                salvation  of  souls  as  well  as  concerned  with  eliminating  or                remedying bad examples. The prophet said that one may be                angry  without  sinning.  The  superior  will  speak  firmly,  will                seriously consider the offense, and will show that his attitude                is  from  zeal,  not  from  anger  or  scorn.  Anger  and  scorn  are                devastating  to  the  soul  of  the  subject,  and  thrust  him  into                diffidence  and  desperation.  Zeal,  instead,  is  pure  charity,                enlivens,  and  attracts,  even  though  it  sometimes  seems  to                throw  down.  Such  a  correction  must  go  along  with  the   293                superior's dignity, because it can be lost by anger or even by                a  gesture or  word of  scorn.  Correcting  on  time,  in  the  right                place,  with  discretion,  strength,  and  dignity  is  most  difficult;                therefore,  the  superior  will  bear  in  mind  these  precautions                and will pray in order that he may be fair, calm, and decorous.                                  4. FITTING CORRECTION                      It  is  the  superior's  duty  to  admonish  his  subjects  by                means of the following corrections:                      First, the corrections must be fitting to the persons,","their  sensibility,  intelligence;  character,  and susceptibility  as                well as to the defects or gravity of the faults.                      The  superior  must  be  aware  that  correcting  the  wrong                doer  in  the  presence  of  other  people  is  sometimes                inconvenient,  because  it  renews  bad  example  or  calls  the                people's attention to facts they should forget, or scandalizes                persons  who  know  nothing  of  the  matter.  For  instance,  if                someone referred that a subject talked back to the superior or                grumbled  secretly,  the  superior  will  beware  of  reproaching                such a subject in the presence of other persons, because it                could scandalize or induce others to do the same.                      If  the  fault  is  committed  in  the  presence  of  the  com-                munity,  the  superior  will  ask  the  culprit  to  remedy  the  fault                before all in the refectory or elsewhere by begging pardon or                by  pleading  guilty.  He  will  always  avoid  to  call  attention  to                faults  whose  remembrance  could  harm.  It  is  to  no  avail                saying:  such  are  defects  everybody  knows,  because                reminding  them  of  the  defects,  causes  them  to  be  firmly                impressed on their memory.                                294                      The superior will never attribute anything to the subject                by  rash  judgment,  for  instance,  by  attributing  intentions  the                subject  never  had  or  actions  he  never  did.  This  is  a  most                delicate  matter.  But  suppose  that  the  superior  is  a  spiritual                man who knows the culprit's malice along with his faults, yet                the culprit is reluctant to acknowledge it more by ignorance                than by stubbornness. In such a case the superior will tell him                to  pray  and  reflect,  or  will  make  him  declare  that  he  will                humble  himself  twice:  first,  because  he  is  at  fault,  second,                because  he  is  unable  to  acknowledge  it.  If  the  subject                acknowledges neither of them by stubbornness, the superior                will  warn  him  more  seriously,  sending  him  back  to  pray,                reflect, and meditate.","He himself will do the same, also asking other people to pray                for the culprit.                      When the superior admonishes a culprit, he must aim at                inducing the subject to recognize his fault and other defects                that  accompany  it.  If  the  culprit  does  not  acknowledge  any                fault, he is hopeless, is very likely to go from bad to worse,                and, therefore, he must be expelled.                      Suppose that the subject is good-natured and observant,                but  for  particular  reasons  he  acknowledges neither  his  fault                nor  its  gravity,  keeping  silent  by  caution.  If  the  fault  is  not                serious and obvious, the superior will interpret his silence as                acknowledgment, because he is not opposing obstinately the                fact.                      Were  the  superior  to  impose  correction  without  the                Lord's enlightenment for lack of prayer, or were the superior                to judge a subject for personal passions, faults, malice, and                bad intentions when such things do not exist, or at least not                as he sees them; in such a case, the superior's demand of   295                the subject to acknowledge the faults as he has judged them                (God  forbid  it)  would  prejudice  the  subject's  soul  seriously.                Serious  too  will  be  the  consequences  such  as  diffidence,                anxiety,  discouragement,  and  even  true  faults  and  loss  of                vocation.                      To avoid ruin to the souls, each superior will pay careful                attention  to  building  up  a  spirit  of  religious  perfection  in                himself, keeping in mind the Holy Spirit's words: « Stick to the                advice your own heart gives you, no one can be truer to you                than that » (Eccl. 37, 17).                                     5. TAKING COVER                      As  soon  as  the  superior  perceives  that  he  has                miscalculated the correction, he will pray to the Madonna of                the  Remedy,  himself  starting  remedying  by  retracting  the                correction directly or indirectly. In case of need, he","will not hesitate to redress the wrong by declaring plainly his                mistake, because upholding the mistake is arrogance and the                cause  of  serious  consequences.  We  must  implore  for  the                divine enlightenment in everything.                      If  a  superior  should  be  offended  by  a  subject,  he  will                avoid considering it a personal case, or reacting with a burst                of passion and selfishness. On the contrary, he will have pity,                keeping  a  calm  and  decorous  silence  to  make  the  culprit                retire into himself. Until the culprit does not see his error, the                superior will pay some tender care to him, returning good for                evil and showing love and charity, 'but in such a way that the                culprit may not think of being in the right. This method is mast                suited  to  subdue  and  make  the  culprit  repent.  However,                everything must be within bounds; if it does not matter to the                culprit, but he abuses, the superior will resort to persuasion,                reserve, and penances, if necessary.                      When the superior is unsure as to how to correct serious                faults, or if he is uncertain about the method of correction, he                will  pray,  will  take  advice  from  his  counselors,  and  will  go   296                ahead  with  them;  it  is  understood  that  all  of  them  have  to                pray.                      If  corrections  in  the religious  institutes  were made  with                holy caution after imploring God's help, many evils would be                avoided,  several  persons  would  amend,  observance  and                discipline  would flourish,  and  the  superior  would  proceed  in                full  agreement  with  the  subjects,  because  corrections  are                drugs  whose  efficacy  depends  on  the  right  application  of                them in weight, number, and measure (R.S.)!                                     6. A PAINFUL SIGN                      The  mother  superior  must  keep  in  mind  that  when                events compel her to use bodily or moral punishments","toward  several  persons,  relaxation  has  already  entered  the                community to ruin it. Other means are needed to bar such a                thing. The mother superior must pay careful attention to ward                off  such  .great  an  evil  by  correcting  little  defects  with                gentleness  and  firmness,  even  through  moral  or  bodily                ,punishments, inducing people to accept such penances with                humility,  mortification,  and  for  God's  sake.  She  will  enliven                the  spirit  of  prayer,  observance,  and  practice  of  religious                virtues.  So  to  speak,  she  must  thrust  relaxation  out  of  the                doors,  locking  it  out.  She  will  pray  and  watch  over  her                mystical  flock  so  that  the  hellish  lion  roaring  around  the                sheepfold be unable to enter and devour even one soul. She                first  must  show  a  holy,  irreproachable  behavior,  setting  the                example of religious virtues and sacrifice for our Lord, for the                good of the community, and for each person.                      No  continuous  hard  reproach,  no  serious,  frequent                punishment, but these are the means apt to correct and lead                the subjects to perfect observance, making the house to be a                garden flourishing with elect souls, where the divine eternal                lover Jesus finds his delight (S.D.D.Z.).                 297                                           NOTES                     (1)   «I   promise   to   receive   with   humility   and   in   silence                the correction or warning or admonishment or penance from the mother                superior and  from  any   person   having   power over  me.   I  will   not                justify  myself,  rather  I  will  acknowledge  my  fault.   For  that  reason I                promise to pay careful attention to let no words of apology out. I   will                take   care   of   it   externally   and   internally,   giving   a   humble                justification  after asking  the admonisher's  permission, when   necessity                requires  it»   (D.P.).

They will  always think of                being at  fault*   (R.P.).","298","CHAPTER X                              MUTUAL LOVE AND RESPECT                     To  my  great  pleasure  I  declare  that  I  have  learned                that this institute holds In great esteem mutual love and                respect,  and  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  command:  «                love each other as I loved you », which distinguishes the                true Christians, in this institute is a main precept like the                command:  «You  must  love  the  Lord  your  God  with  all                your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. »                     With  God's  help  and  my  own  good  will  I  pledge                myself,  promising  to  pay  careful  attention  to  this  holy                love. I will try to form a tender, affectionate, loving heart                for  the  members  of  the  institute,  asking  the  most  holy                Heart of Jesus to grant me the spirit of charity toward my                brethren in order to love, sympathize, wish, and procure                their good as much as I can, as if it were mine.                     Bewaring  of  nurturing  aversion  or  grudge  against   299                anyone,  still  less  against  those  who  seem  contrary  or                offensive to me, I promise the following:                     1.  I  will  not  be  prone  to  believe  that  I  have  been                offended,  I  will  think  instead  that  my  imagination  and                selfishness amplify the things making them appear grim                to me.                     2.  If  someone  really  offends  me,  I  will  not  become                indignant,  but  I  will  sympathize,  love,  and  look  on  him                favorably,  recommending  him  to  the  Lord  in  order  to                return good for evil.                     I  will  combine  holy  love  with  my  sincere  respect                toward  the  institute's  components,  adults  or  children,                superiors  or  fellows  or  servants,  considering  that  God                created,  redeemed,  and  gathered  them  here;  that  our                Lord  gave  up  himself  for  each  of  them,  that  he  feeds                them with his divine body and Most Precious Blood more                than often, destining them to","eternal glory. Avoiding to even saying the least offensive                word to a child, I will address the priests with the title of                father,  and  will  deal  kindly  with  the  brothers,  the  poor,                and the children.                               1. THE VIRTUES' TOUCH-STONE                      The  world  ratifies  revenge  as  a  predominant  passion                with  this  anti-evangelical  saying:  only  the  mountains  do  not                meet! People are vindictive by nature; they hardly forget an                offence,  but  pay  with  the  same  coin at  the  first  opportunity.                The  offended  person  may  be  a  good  person,  even                consecrated  to  the  Lard,  who  abhors  revenge  by  principle.                Still,  if  he  was  offended  or  thinks  he  has  been  seriously                offended, he takes no revenge in the open, but if he has the                power to favor his true or presumed offender, he won't do so!                And because he needs to harmonize his conscience and the                divine  law  of  forgiveness  with  his  revenge,  he  will  create                palliatives by rationalizing and deceiving himself through his   300                reasoning.  Oh,  in  how  many  cases  the  real  gist  is  to  vent                one's offended and resented selfishness! Because of that the                Lord will judge so many actions that we call justice and truth!                « I will dispense strict justice » (Ps. 75, 2). (Oration, Mons.                Carrano).                      Behaving  charitably  and  conveniently  with  the  persons                who live with us is the touch-stone of virtue and good nature.                Behaving  cements  the  community,  which  subsists  in  the                members' mutual union of charity. The best rule far this topic                is our Lord Jesus Christ's saying, « As I have loved you, so                you must love one another » (Jn. 13, 34) as well as « If you                have love for one another, then all will know that you are my                disciples » (Jn. 13,35).","The probationers will avoid quarreling and loud talk with                each  other,  but  they  will  love  and  respect  each  other                mutually. They  will  not barter  any  object  without  permission                nor accuse one of anything out of personal vengeance not:                will  they  nurture  a  grudge;  on  the  contrary  they  will                sympathize and help each other even though it may require                some sacrifice. The observance of this rule is indispensable                to form this community with the Lord's help.                      That the probationers must be united in mutual love of                charity  goes  without  saying,  but  they  must  beware  of                nurturing  particular  friendship,  because  it  draws  the  soul                away from love of Jesus and from vocation to religious life;                therefore, the probationers are not allowed to confide secrets                to each other nor to talk and stay alone by two (P.R.P.).                      Each  aspirant  will  restrain  himself  from  nurturing  a                grudge  against  his  fellows,  from  scorning  or  charging  them                with  anything  for  personal  trifles,  instead  he  will  endure                contradictions  with  patience,  will  sympathize,  respect,  and                love his fellows in the Lord, being always ready to favor, help,   301                and serve them.                      For  discipline  and  virtue's  sake  the  aspirants  will  avoid                flying  into  passion,  giving  free  rein  to  angry  words  and                actions;  they  must  accustom  themselves  to  restrain  their                natural impulses out of mutual respect.                      Laying hands on and forming particular friendship harm                spirit and discipline; therefore they are strictly forbidden to the                aspirants, but they must love and esteem each other equally.                It  is  also  unbecoming  for  them  to  give  the  eye  or  laugh  or                make signs, as agreed upon (R.A.).","2. ONE HEART, ONE SOUL                      I promise to respect my fellows, behaving with kindness,                sincere and pure affection, as well as to be free from personal                attachment, liking, and intimacy, warding off the people who                try to have such relations; if they persist, I will refer everything                to the mother superior. I will also avoid nurturing aversion or                grudge  against  anyone,  still  less  against  those  who  seem                contrary or offensive to me (D.P.). (1)                      The  sisters  will  respect  and  love  each  other  in  Jesus                Christ  with  pure,  simple,  hearty,  and  gentle  affection                sympathizing  mutually,  keeping  peace  and  harmony,  and                warding off  any  resentment as  a  devil's  temptation.  No  one                will speak ill of another, no one will marvel at their defects,                but they will pray and help each other within the bounds of                holy obedience. If someone happens to offend a fellow, she                will humbly ask her for pardon, and the other one will do the                same (D.S.S.).                      Since  the  community  is  unable  to  please  God,  to   302                improve,  and  to  produce  fruits,  unless  it  is  enlivened  by                charity  through  union  of  hearts,  the  sisters  will  strive  to  be                united in the charity of Jesus Christ, and to become one heart                and one soul. So that their spiritual union may be founded on                Jesus  Christ's  pure  charity,  the  novices  will  avoid  the  least                intimacy or particular familiarity, avoiding to touch or hug or                kiss each other. They will restrain themselves from useless or                unbecoming  talks,  from  confiding  secrets  and  things                concerning  confession,  from  speaking  ill,  from  letting  off                steam, from sharing in nevus which feeds curiosity, and from                any  other  confidential  relationship;  they  instead  will  practice                charity by bearing with one another, by wording off even the                least","grudge from their heart, by praying and helping each other in                their  work  and  much  more  in  sickness.  Each  of  them  will                choose the worst things and the last place for herself, leaving                the  best  to  the  others.  If  someone  happens  to  displease  a                fellow,  she  will  humbly  beg  pardon  following  the  advice  of                obedience.  They  will  deal  with  mutual  respect,  calling  each                other  sister...  Admonishing  each  other  is  also  a  practice  of                charity. Therefore, if a novice happens to notice a defect, she                may kindly let her sister knave it in order to amend. The sister                who  has  been  cautioned  will  receive  the  advice  humbly,                amending and thus advancing in holy perfection (R.L.P.).                      Loving  this  institute's  members  as  myself  is  my  main                goal for reaching evangelical perfection. So, I will respect all                of them, holding each one greater than I am before God; I will                bear any defect or piece of rudeness with love, patience, and                kindness being ready to help and serve my fellows as much                as charity and obedience allow me. In everything, my rule will                be our Lord Jesus Christ's command, « As I have loved you,                so you must love one another » (Jn. 13, 34). I will be never                envious of them, either when they are preferred or are told to   303                be  right  and  I  am  told  to  be  wrong,  or  when  they  are                appointed to offices which I am being denied; keeping myself                calm and unchanged, I will always have with them relations of                peace, charity, and humility (P.D.P.).                      This  pious  institute's  congregants  will  bear  in  mind  the                adorable  Heart of  Jesus'  commandment, « As  I  have  loved                you, so you must love one another. If you have love for one                another, then all will know that you are my disciples » (Jn. 13,                34-35).  Each  one  will  jealously  preserve  union  of  hearts                through  mutual  charity,  holding  the  others  as  beloved                brothers in Jesus Christ as well","as bearing with each other without forming a bad opinion of                any  of  them.  Mutual  help  will  be  within  the  bounds  of  holy                obedience, and no one will offend his brother in Jesus Christ.                Not  even  fleeting  aversion  or  grudge  is  allowed,  and  when                something might impair mutual love, each congregant should                precede  his  brothers  in  the  reconciliation.  Mutual  charity                suffers  no  affection  of  personal  liking  or  attachments;                therefore each one will respect the others, regarding them as                our Lord Jesus Christ did (C.R.).                                   3. MORTUARY CHAPEL                      Each  house  should  build  a  mortuary  chapel  in  the                cemetery  as  a  communal  burial  place  for  those  who  were                united in life by Christ's bonds of charity. They were sisters in                the divine savior’s adorable blood, lived in pure love for each                other,  sharing  in  the  same  joy,  the  same  pain,  the  same                work,' and were destined to be united in heaven. It is right,                beautiful, and desirable that they rest in the same mortuary                chapel. The houses which do not have it yet, will do their best   304                through prayer and human means to build it. Meantime they                will  provide  each  dead  with  a  cell  or  a piece  of  land  in  the                cemetery, registering the file or the cell or the place's number                where  their  human  remains  rest  so  that  they  may  be                transferred to the future mortuary chapel (S.D.D.Z.).                                           NOTE                     (1)  I  promise  the  following:  1)  I  will  not  easily  think  of  being                offended, because my fantasy and selfishness amplify the little things,                making them appear grim to me. 2) If someone offends me really, I will                not be angry, but compassionate; furthermore I will love, look favorably,                and recommend her to the Lord in order to return good for evil with the                Lord's  help.  Likewise  I  will  beware  of  charging  or  ill-treating  or  taking                pleasure in her suffering in any way, out of vengeance » (D.P.).","CHAPTER XI                              RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE                      For  our  duty  of  setting  good  example,  for  the                institute's  honor,  for  my  spiritual  improvement,  and the                improvement of others I will pay careful attention when I                deal with people in the institute and outside of it, treating                everyone with prudence, respect, and charity. I will avoid                setting  bad  example,  becoming  agitated,  and  offending                anyone,  because  I  want  to  practice  the  Apostle  Paul's                statement: « We do not want anyone to find fault with our                work, so we try not to put obstacles in anyone's way » (2.                Cor.  6,  3).  So,  I  will  cope  patiently  and  benignly  with                everyone, especially with the troublesome, the poor, and                the sick, dissimulating any insult and bearing in mind the                Ecclesiasticus'  saying:  «  The  wise  man  dissimulates                insults, but the fool gets angry quickly. »                                                                            305                                   1.  GOOD EXAMPLE                      The  congregants  will  combine  fine  manners  with                simplicity  and  religious  decorum  while  dealing  with  them-                selves  and  with  outsiders,  striving  to  be  cheerful,  and                avoiding sadness or ill humor.                      A  gracious,  sympathetic,  and  friendly  manner  to  every-                one is a great religious virtue, and greatly recommended to                this pious institute's members. To accomplish the aim of the                institute,  the  congregants  will  nurture  and  practice  spiritual                and temporal charity toward their neighbor through works of                religion  and  beneficence,  as  much  as  they  can,  and  will                console everyone with holy words and","temporal help, avoiding to afflict anyone. While dealing with                their  offenders  and  opposers,  they  will  conduct  themselves                with  particular  charity,  returning  greater  good  to  them  and                avoiding revenge (C.R.).                      To be acceptable to the most holy Heart of Jesus, with                his  divine  help  I  resolve  to  observe  not  only  the  religious                rules,  but  also  gracious  manners  while  treating,  talking,                walking, eating, laughing, visiting, etc. (D.P.).                      So that the religious virtues may edify and win souls to                the  Lord,  the  sisters  will  behave  devoutly,  setting  perfect                examples of a holy, virtuous life and being observant in their                mutual relationship and with the outsiders, in private and in                public (H.S.E.).                                       2. SIMPLICITY                      God is simplest spirit, draws the simple to  himself, and                talks with them. The principle of religious virtue requires that   306                one  practices  simplicity  of  heart  and  avoids  simulation,                duplicity, and hypocrisy toward God and neighbor. Avoidance                of rash judging anyone and the disposition to justify or regard                the  failings  of  others  with  indulgence  also  belong  to  holy                simplicity. This virtue does not lead one to disapprove of the                orders of obedience or to condemn the actions of others, but                disposes them to look on everything as good through a child's                belief.                      Simplicity is also characterized by prudence to which our                Lord  Jesus  Christ's  pointed:  «  You  must  be  as  cautious  as                serpents and as gentle as doves » (Mt. 10, 16). This celestial,                purest  prudence  differs  from  the  worldly  prudence  and  the                human  respect.  Even  though  it  sees  everything  with                simplicity, still it judges between good and evil as they really                are before God.","Holy  simplicity  abhors  lies.  Behaving  frankly  and                sincerely  according  to  the  divine  oracle  «  yes,  no,  »  each                congregant  will  avoid  the  spirit  of  falsehood  as  if  it  were  a                pest of the soul. Not to expose simplicity and sincerity to risk,                the  congregants  will  almost  never  make  use  of  compound                mental abstraction, preferring to conceal through silence what                is useless to manifest (C.R.).                                       3. MEEKNESS                         Meekness  is  a  daughter  of  holy  humility,  and  helps                the people to become humble. Each Rogationist will be most                vigilant in the exercise of this virtue, bearing in mind our Lord                Jesus Christ's words: « Learn from me, because I am gentle                and  humble  of  spirit  »  (Lk.  11,  28).  Looking  to  his  divine                example,  each  congregant  will  excel  in  this  elect  virtue  in                every  circumstance  by  controlling  and  mortifying  himself.                Even  though  one  may  be  somehow  angry  without  sinning,                while admonishing, for necessity, usually we have to be meek                while  speaking  (we  should  almost  always  speak  in  a  low   307                voice), while commanding, but over all while relating with our                neighbor so that no one be scandalized (C.R.).                         Each superior is warmly urged to keep himself calm                and  perfectly  meek  in  every  event,  because  his  excitement                rebounds on his subjects. It is written: « Yahweh was not in                the wind, » for He is the spirit of eternal peace. The superior                is not forbidden to feel the impressions of the events, to share                them  intensely,  and  to  act  with  fervor  and  concern  in  the                circumstances, but he must never lose his internal calmness,                for  wisdom  consists  in  combining  concern  and  fervor  with                internal quiet, which makes everything proceed in order. Here                is the rub: the","superior  will  never  act  by  passion,  which  is  the  source  of                these vices: anger, furor, and wrath; if he feels them, he must                not consent to them (R.S.).                      Meekness!  St.  Francis  of  Sales  says  that  this  virtue                should prevail over the others like oil floating on water. Such                a  virtue  is  necessary  to  everyone,  but  especially  to  the                superior for many reasons.                      The first reason is good example. Irascibility is common                among human beings, but emotions of impatience are more                spread among the Religious. The hellish enemy exploits the                persons' inclination to irascibility and impatience by working                upon  it.  Unless  the  superior  prevails  over  this  passion                perfectly  through  meekness,  he  is  unable  to  work  as  he                should,  and,  therefore,  he  jeopardizes  his  subjects  on  the                devil's  behalf!  Very  soon  his  impatience,  his  very  first                emotions, outbursts, resentments, agitated talks, and the like                unbridle each  Religious'  anger,  deranging  the  community  in                such a way that the spiritual building collapses.                                                                          308                     What  a  disaster  the  untamed  irascibility  is!  Each  Su-                perior  and  Religious  must  always  keep  in  mind  our  Lord                Jesus  Christ's  sweetest,  gentlest  meekness.  He  performed                the great work of the redemption through his meekness and                gentleness  as  the  prophet  Isaiah  had  foretold.  He  went  to                death  like  a  meek  lamb  without  opening  his  mouth  or                complaining, and his meekness heartened his executioners to                torment  him  in  so  many  ways.  Had  he  reproached                vehemently his executioners for their cruelty, they would have                stopped ill-treating him, and our redemption would have been                interrupted. Oh, let us be infinitely thankful to our Lord Jesus                Christ for his meekness, which let him work our redemption                perfectly!  The  psalmist  says  to  God:  «  Yahweh,  remember                David and all the hardships he suffered » (Ps. 132, 1): here,                David is a symbol of","Jesus, who included meekness among the beatitudes of the                mount when he said: « Happy are the meek; they will receive                what  God  has  promised  »  (Mt.  5,  5).  The  meek  soul  is  so                self-controlled that it never yields to anger.                      Each one will be meek, but the superior more. To reach                this  beautiful,  beloved  virtue  which  draws  other  virtues  with                itself, one must practice it and pray for it all his life long. We                read: « In all that is right he guides the humble » (Ps. 24, 9): it                means  that  God  guides  the  meek  superior's  actions  and                words in the ways of His divine will, enabling him to lead his                subjects to Jesus Christ (R.S.).                           4. IN THE DAY-SCHOOLS FOR CHIDREN                      Those  having  no  relationship  in  the  work  of  the  kin-                dergarten or in the day-school will not concern themselves in                them,  and  those  engaged  in  work  in  them  will  tend  only  to                their own responsibilities. Each sister will refrain from giving                the  children  images  of  saints,  or  anything  else,  as  well  as   309                from petting them, talking, still less entrusting the day-school                children with errands or delivering letters secretly, which is a                serious  fault  worthy  of  punishment  and  a  worst  example.                Likewise,  they  will  avoid  particular  affection  to  anyone  of                them.  If  someone  happens  to  know  such  things,  she  will                make it known to the mother superior.                      The teachers of the day-school and of the kindergarten                will  treat  the  pupils  and  children  lovingly  and  respectfully,                warding off favoritism, or prejudice. Such a fault of the sisters                would be greater than the fault of the other Religious who are                not keeping in touch with the day-school pupils and children                (S.D.D.Z.).","The  sisters  appointed  to  an  institute  for  girls  must  be                convinced that they must keep in touch with society, whose                reasonable  needs  they  will  serve;  therefore,  they  will  be                prudent, intelligent, and virtuous, imploring the Lord's help in                order to cope with the people in accordance with obedience,                and to increase the Institute's reputation through their work.                Refined manners of sound education and courtesy are greatly                recommended  to  the  sisters,  because  a  good  education  is                like a sister to devotion (S.I.G.).                      The  sisters  will  use  fine  manners  among  themselves,                with the pupils, and the public, shunning from saying the least                word offensive to anyone, even to a child. Once a week they                will  read  the  fine  manner  book.  Besides,  they  will  make                cleanliness  shine  in  the  house,  furniture,  household  goods,                linen, and clothes.                      Their  beautiful  mission  consists  in  gathering  civilized                children and children of the people to train them in the work,                to educate, edify, and teach them the duties of the Christian                religion. They must carry out this holy mission with care and   310                application,  by  edifying  the  pupils  through  their  own  good                example, by emanating the odor of sanctity, of religious and                civil virtues, and by making the children enchanted and won                to  good  and  virtue.  Woe,  if  before  the  pupils  they  appear                faulty,  angry,  lazy,  cool  in  piety,  and  conflicting  among                themselves! Everything would be lost and the Heart of Jesus'                interests would be betrayed! God would not bless them!                      Likewise, they will not discuss the private affairs of the                community  with  anyone, nor  will  they  disapprove  of  nor  will                they speak ill of other sisters.                      If they receive a tuition, the sisters are also bound in duty                by justice to teach the pupils as loving, caring mothers, and to                improve themselves through continuous","education.  They  will  show  a  reserved  affection,  avoiding                affectionate  displays  of  kissing  or  of  being  kissed  by  them                (D.S.S.).                      The sisters who run a day-school for girls are expected                to be good examples of religious and civil life. Woe, if before                children a sister appears reluctant to obey a superior! Woe, if                they quarrel among themselves! Woe, if they speak ill of each                other  with  outsiders!  It  is  like  killing  the  poor  pupils'  souls,                ruining  the  day-school,  discrediting  the  institute  and  the                sacred  garb!  If  it  happened,  would  they  have  any  hope  for                vocations? In such a case, how much would they offend the                most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus?  Haw  would  our  Lord  bless  and                foster that dayschool?                      For  that  reason  the  mother  superior  will  appoint`  the                most perfect, polite, and learned sisters to the day-school for                girls. This great responsibility weighs on her!                      When  the  pupils  happen  to  refer  some  criticism  of  lay                persons or priests against the sisters, they will brush off such   311                things showing no resentment, but, to edify, they will add: «                You are  wrong: these are honest .persons; they do not say                such  things  »;  then,  dropping  the  subject  they  will  call  the                attention to work, etc. (S.D.D.Z.).                                  5. EDIFYING EVERYONE                      The sisters will strive to avoid the least voluntary defect                and evade the involuntary ones as much as they can. They                will keep in their mind that a virgin consecrated to Jesus must                be  like  a  lily  among  the  thorns,  a  closed  garden,  a  sealed                fountain  living  an  angelical,  immaculate  life  in  thoughts,                wards, actions, and everything so that the aura of purity shall                ascend to the celestial groom (D.S.S.).","Besides  cultivating  spiritual  purity,  the  sisters  will  be                most modest in their actions, avoiding lengthy talks with men                or priests beyond what is necessary, to have eye contact, to                have confidential talks, and to be alone with them for along                time. The sisters will neither kiss each other, nor the children,                nor the priest's hand; it will be enough to say to them: Bless                me, Father. They will not lay hands on each other, nor on the                children, nor let the children do so, but will avoid attachments,                personal  affections,  preferences,  and  secret  friendship.                Walking  through  the  streets  they  will  be  most  modest,                avoiding laugh and idle talk (D.S.C.).                      Because  the  sisters  of  active  life  are  in  the  midst  of                society, it is their duty to edify the .people. They will bear in                mind the Apostle Paul's sayings: 1. « Show a gentle attitude                toward all » (Phil. 4, 5). Here, gentle attitude is the edifying                behavior.  2. « For  I  have  an  obligation  to  all  people,  to the                civilized  and  to  the  savage,  to  the  educated  and  to  the                ignorant » (Rom. 1, 14). 3. « We do not want anyone to find                fault with our work, so we try not to put obstacles in anyone's                way » (2. Cor. 6, 3). In short, we have to behave in such a   312                way that our ministry of charity and religion be not blamed nor                discredited.                      By  edification  the  sisters  command  respect  and  win                many  souls  to  God.  None  of  them  will  develop  familiar                relationship with anyone nor will she laugh confidentially with                outsiders,  nor  will  she  speak  of  the  community's  private                affairs with them.                      The  sisters  will  observe  justice  by  paying  the  workers'                legal wages; they will practice charity by avoiding to overwork                the  laborers;  will  be  benign  with  them  by  abounding  in                consideration and retribution.                      Because all human beings are creatures of God and the                price of the adorable blood of Jesus Christ, the sisters","will respect all of those to whom they minister by internal and                external  behavior,  even  though  these  persons  may  be                miserable and abject.                      Treating with people of rank, the sisters will pay the due                respect and the refined, gracious, unaffected manners of the                holy Church's teaching. When the sisters keep in touch with                civil  or  state  authorities  in  occasion  of  their  visits  to  the                institute  or  in  any  other  event,  they  will  pay  the  greatest                respect  by  using  the  reverent  speech  which  is  due  to  their                dignity.                      Both in the cities and in the little towns, the sisters will                foster among the pupils and the orphans the esteem for the                king,  the  queen,  (1)  the  prefect,  and  the  mayor.  When  it  is                required by society, they will send greeting cards to them and                their  ladies  on  special  occasions,  such  as  their  saint's  day,                birthday,  and  main  feasts  like  New  Year's  Day  and                Christmas. It is always useful. In some occurrence they may                send a gift such as devotions, children's small works, etc. It is                excellent  .inviting  them  to  attend  performances  or  rewards   313                after exams, etc. When a personality happens to fall ill, the                community will be concerned, will get information, will let him                know  that  the  community  is  praying;  during  the                convalescence a cake or something else may be also sent.                      All this induces esteem and affection; we, however, have                to  do  so  not  for  human  protection  but  by  faith,  confiding  in                God only. And yet, we have to use licit means to keep friendly                relations  with  authorities  because  of  the  good  results  for                God's  glory,  for  the  institute's  good,  and  for  the  persons  in                authority,  who  are  led  to  form  a  good  opinion  of  the  holy                religion along with its institutions (S.D.D.Z.).                  ________________                    (1)  When our padre was writing, the king and queen were reigning                in Italy.","314","CHAPTER XII                                  IN THE LORD'S HOUSE                      1  recognize  that  I  must  be  a  model  for  everyone                everywhere, but above all in the church because it is the                Lord's house.                     Before  entering  the  Lord's  house  1  will  remember                the  Holy  Spirit's  saying:  cWhen  you  enter  the  Lord's                house, take care of your steps. * I will not enter it hastily                and rashly, but at a sedate and recollected pace, making                the  sign  of  the  cross  with  holy  water.  Then  i  will                genuflect,  adoring  the  most  Holy  Sacrament.  When  1                pass  before  the  holy  tabernacle,  1  will  genuflect                reverently and recollectedly.                     While kneeling in church I can rest my hands on the                chair or the pew and my forehead on my hands in order                to concentrate my thoughts, but without leaning against                the  chair  or  the  pew.  Calm  and  recollected,  I  will  not                engage in conversation with anyone; only when obliged                by necessity I will speak in a low voice and briefly.     315                     During the prayer in common I will pray with a low,                contrite voice; when the rule or necessity lets us sit, I will                do so decorously and modestly.                     So  that  my  external  behavior  in  church  be                well-regulated 1 will strive to be recollected in the divine                presence  offering  praise,  thanksgiving,  petitions,  and                love to the Lord.                      When  the  people  enter  the  church  or  the  sacramental                oratory they must pay reverence with faith, considering that                they are in the presence of God, our adorable, beloved Lord                Jesus Christ, the eternal king surrounded by the angels and                the  saints  along  with  the  queen  of  heaven  and  earth,  who                adore  Him  deeply.  Before  entering,  each  in  an  actitude  of                faith, will think of what she is going to","say  to  the  supreme  goodness  in  the  sacrament  while                adoring  and  praying.  It  is  written:  <  Before  entering                God's sanctuary, take care of your steps and avoid to be                like  one  tempting  God.  »  They  will  be  recollected  and                devout  in  the  presence  of  God  in  the  sacrament,  will                increase  their  respect,  recollection,  devotion,  and  faith                during the exposition of the holy host (S:D.D.Z.).                      They will say the vocal prayers reverently, pausing,                and  in  a  low  voice  which  expresses  internal                compunction; cries, rash, and confused voices are to be                avoided. They must concert the vocal prayers in order to                learn how to say them properly, as by art (R.A.).                      If  the  aspirants  go  to  a  public  church  to  assist  at                mass or to listen to a sermon or to serve at the altar, they                will  be  careful  to  be  for  the  people  example  of  great                recollection and perfect modesty (R.A.).                      Because  prayer  is  indispensable  for  sanctification                and eternal life, the Little Retreat novices will cultivate a   316                love  for  it,  praying  vocally  and  mentally,  as  our  Lord                Jesus Christ taught us.                     While  praying  vocally  the  novices  will  combine  in-                ternal recollection with attention, speaking with a gentle                voice  and  a  moving  tune,  which  induce  devotion  and                recollection; they will avoid high and unpleasant tone of                voice. They must keep in mind that vocal prayer is not a                performance, a declamation, but a wail of the spirit: the                wail of the mystical dove (R.L.P.).                     The sister header of the vocal prayer at the choir will                make  no  mistakes:  avoiding  too  high or  low  voice,  she                will read with a moving tune to express compuction and                contrition  of  heart,  as  well  as  to  express  the  wails of  a                humble spirit. She is responsible for saying the prayers                prescribed by the rule: if some prayer is omitted through                her fault, she is responsible for it (R:L:P.).","CHAPTER XIII                         CONSENTING TO APPOINTMENTS                     1 promise to accept any office to which my superiors                deem to appoint me by obedience, humble and painful as                it  may  be.  Much  more,  when  they  give  me  humble  and                painful assignments I will be happier promising to carry                them out exactly and attentively, even though 1 have to                sacrifice  myself.  If  for  reasons  of  health  or  any  other                valid reason I feel that 1 cannot accept the appointment, I                will  submit  my  reason  to  the  superiors  humbly  and                plainly, and follow their decision.                           1.   ASSIGNMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY                      As the working of the motor depends on each of its parts                working in harmony, so the well-proceeding of a community                depends on the exact execution of each of the assignments.   317                It  follows  that  each  person  performing  her  task  with  the                greatest  attention,  diligence,  and  effectiveness  is  of  great                momentum  in  a  community,  because  it  enjoys  the  good                effects  of  one's  duty  perfectly  fulfilled,  whereas  when                someone is negligent in performing her duty, the whole house                suffers its detrimental effects, either temporal or spiritual.                     Each  officer  must  consider  her  task  as  related  to  the                practice of the vow or the virtue of obedience. Because it is                obedience  that  assigns  the  tasks,  each  one  must  receive                them from the hand of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the most                holy Virgin Mary, who are our","divine  superiors.  By  such  a  consideration  the  officer  will                understand with how much loyalty, attention, diligence, and-                love  she  has  to  perform  her  duties,  whose  fulfillment  is  a                service to God, a religious act, and an execution of the divine                will.  One  must  accept  any  office  with  this  faith.  The                completion  of  one's  own  task  implies  as  many  acts  of                obedience  as  many  are  the  actions  needed  to  perform  it;  I                would  say  that  the  acts  of  obedience  are  as  many  as  the                instants you need to perform the obedience; in addition, the                proven  disposition  to  fulfill  one's  own  duty  deserves  the                merits  of  obedience  continuously.  Accomplishing  well  one's                own  assignment  is  like  accomplishing  an  important  part  of                one's vocation (S:D.D.Z.).                      The  young  probationers  will  be  employed  in  the  as-                signments  necessary  to  maintain the  well-proceeding  of  the                house. Each will be willing to receive the assignment in the                spirit of holy obedience without desiring others he would like.                They can only wish and ask for the humblest tasks, holding                them  as  the  noblest  before  the  Lord,  but  even  in  this  case                they must calmly leave the matter in the hands of obedience.   318                Each  probationer  will  fulfill  his  own  task  scrupulously  and                exactly; negligence is imputed to him as a serious fault. The                community will say a prayer to the most holy Heart of Jesus                every  day,  asking  help  for  the  well  fulfillment  of  the                assignments.  Each  one  will  perform  his  task  in  the  divine                presence  to  glorify  the  Lord  and  to  perform  his  will;  thus,                fulfilling  one's  own  duty  will  be  meritorious  before God.  Oh,                how  many  merits  a  youth  deserves  when  he  performs  his                duty in the spirit of obedience, humility, and diligence!                      Besides other punishments, those who are negligent in                fulfilling their assignments may be deprived of or suspended                from doing them (P.R.P.).                      Depriving a person of her assignment when she does","not  recognize  her  faults  nor  wants  to  amend  is  a  moral                punishment. To awaken up in her the remorse of eating the                divine providence's bread undeservedly, let her be idle. This                punishment  is  most  sensible  and  suitable  to  produce                repentance and amendment (S:D.D.Z.).                      To be the most neglected and mortified the novices will                compete  in  obedience,  charity,  and  humility,  seeking  for                themselves  the  poorest,  humblest,  painful  things  or                assignments. The humblest tasks will be given as reward or                taken away as punishment. The novices will love and respect                each other in a holy manner, each one seeking to relieve the                others by  asking  for  herself  the  heavier  burdens  and  works                (R.N.).                      The  sisters  will  strive  to  be  diligent,  industrious,  and                intelligent, trusting in the Lord and imploring his help.                      Diligence  means  paying  attention  to  performing  every-                thing  well  without  forgetting  anything.  Being  industrious                means  working  willingly  and  avoiding  idleness,  because  by   319                working quickly and actively we do many works, minding the                community's  interests.  Intelligence  means  that  the  sisters                themselves  have  to  find  out  the  best  way  to  make  things                proceed well according to the rules and holy obedience.                     Each  sister  will  fulfill  her  assignment  with  the  utmost                diligence,  activity,  and  intelligence,  imploring  God's  help                (S:I:G.).                     A  novice  may  be  appointed  to  the  kitchen  by  holy                obedience; in such a case she will somehow provide that the                daily purchases be at her disposal in time. While cooking she                will pay careful attention so that no thing be wasted and the                Pious  Institute's  members  be  not  disheartened  for  ill                treatment  in  the  food.  Cleanness  of  the  kitchen,  of  the                household tools, and of the food will be at her heart. On the                whole, she will shun from preparing","delicious, affected dishes in order to avoid gluttony, but will                provide well cooked, tasty food (R.L.P.).                     The sister cook will do her best while cooking. Her task                is to maintain the life and strength of the sisters who work for                Jesus and souls: thus, she may share in the good operated                by  them  as  if  she  herself  were  working  together  with  them.                She will beware of the least gluttony, to which the enemy of                the  souls  could  tempt  her.  Being  always  in  the  divine                presence, at the sight of the fire she will remember hell and                the fire of purgatory in order to avoid any defect, to pray for                the  conversion  of  sinners,  and  to  intercede  for  the  souls  in                purgatory.  Utmost  cleanness  in  everything  is  greatly                recommended (D.S.S.).                      Each will be diligent in fulfilling her assignment avoiding                to neglect or to waste anything. To keep the children and the                people's respect alive, the sisters will not wear a soiled garb,                nor  a  worn,  bruised  veil  or  covers,  but  will  be  very  neatly                dressed even in the house (SlC:E.).                      All  will  be  fond  of  cleanness,  which  is  not  against   320                poverty. The people, clothes, rooms, and the whole house will                be clean (C:R.).                      True devotion is fond of cleanness (R:L.P.).                      I  declare  that  I am ready  to receive  from  my  superiors                any  assignment  they  decide  to  give  me,  even  the  humble                ones,  and  to  fulfill  them  with  joy  and  readiness;  if  health                reasons  or  any  other  valid  reason  are  against  this                assignment, I will humbly submit my reason to the superior,                and will follow his advice. I also declare that I am not attached                to a particular assignment or work, therefore I will pretend no                assignment of my liking because I am fond of and ready to                perform what the superiors tell me to do (P.D:P.).","Assignments  range  from  superior's  office  to  door-                keeper's but all of them are for our Lord Jesus Christ, and the                last assignment is like the first one, and the first like the last.                No one is allowed to refuse or leave the assignment, on the                contrary he will receive it from our Lord's hands, painful as it                may be. No one will long for a nobler or less difficult job: if                someone  wants  to  be  ambitious,  he  will  long  for  the  most                abject, hurOble, and difficult job. Each will be full of good will                to  exactly  fulfill  his  job,  following  the  rules  and  the  orders.                When  someone  happens  to  be  absent,  he  will  inform  the                superior for providing with a substitute, because no one can                change  nor  meddle  with  the  job  of  others,  even  for  help,                without permission. From necessity, however, it may be done                until it is related to the supervisor (C:R.). (1).                      I  promise  to  joyously  accept  from  obedience  any  job,                even the humble or material or difficult or painful one, never                refusing it; if health reasons or anything else are against, I will                submit  them  to  the  superior  with  simplicity,  following  his                advice.  I  also  promise  to  fulfill  the  assignments  with  care,                attention, and exactitude admitting as of now that negligence   321                or repeated faults in the fulfillment of my job be imputed to me                and be punished, if necessary. I will prefer the most abject,                humble  jabs  as  the  ones  that  fit me  better, and  will  ask  for                them (D.P.).                      While assigning the tasks the superior will pay attention                to  each  person's  health,  skill,  and  disposition,  correcting                those persons who long for a particular assignment or those                who  do  not  want  to  leave  the  one  they  have.  When  the                subject  may  be  satisfied  prudently,  the  superior  can  please                him; the superior, however, will warn the subject to be ready                to leave his job at any time he is asked to do so. Likewise, if                the  subject  has  a  job,  he  will  continue  to  have  it  until  the                superior decides otherwise","for  the  subject's  good;  and  the  subject  will  be  docile  and                strong enough to detach himself from it (R.C.).                            2. OFFICES AND INTERNAL LIFE                      The  novices  will  engage  themselves  in  the  practice  of                active life with such a moderation and tranquillity of spirit that                the  practice  of  contemplative  life  be  not  jeopardized.  Their                service will consist in fulfilling the assigned tasks exactly. In                the  morning,  the  novices  will  say  a  brief,  particular  prayer                asking  God  for  enlightenment  and  grace  to  fulfill  the  daily                tasks... They  will  strive  to  do their  duty  with  diligence,  love,                humility, and loyalty.                      The  Little  Retreat  novice  will  strive  to  be  always  re-                collected in God, whatsoever her job may be. She will pray to                God  not  only  at  the  beginning  of  the  day  to  win  the  grace                necessary to fulfill her tasks, but she will also have a mind to                do  everything  for  God's  greater  glory,  for  the  souls'                sanctification, and for the sanctification of her neighbor.                                                                          322                     On this purpose, the novices will consider the fulfilling of                the  tasks  assigned  to  them  as  deserving  the  maintenance                and improvement of the pious .institute, which is committed to                the  glory  of  the  most  holy  name  of  Jesus  and  to  the                sanctification of souls. They will consider their tasks not only                in themselves and in holy obedience, but also in relation to                the  profit  of  so  many  souls,  the  good  results  in  so  many                children,  and  the  aims  that  God  may  have  on  this  little                charitable  institute;  as  well  as  in  relation  to  the  hopes,  the                wishes,  and  the  prayers  concerning  the  fortunes  this  pious                institute will have in the most holy                Heart of Jesus.                      After taking into consideration these topics, the","novices will hold any work, painful and humble as it may be,                as  sweet  as  it  is  glorious.  Sweeping  a  room,  cleaning  a                casserole,  mending  clothes  will  be  great  when  they  are                related to God's glory and to the souls' sanctification. Besides                the  general  intentions,  the  novice  will  have  particular                intentions about her tasks, considering fitting topics to lift up                her mind to God.                      For instance, if the sister is on duty to clear or wash the                clothes, she may consider the cleanness the soul must have                to be a dwelling worthy of our beloved Jesus Christ. If she is                employed  on  sewing,  following  St. Magdalen  Dei  Pazzi  she                may ask God for the conversion of as many sinners as the                stitches she does, praising and blessing God as many times                as  well.  If  she  is  employed  in  cooking,  she  may  consider                divine providence's generosity in feeding his creatures or the                celestial, eternal banquet where God feeds the elect with His                glory. If she is a nurse, she will see our Lord Jesus Christ in                any  sick  child,  remembering  our  Lord's  saying  on  the                judgement day: cc I was sick and you visited me. » If she is                watching  over  the  little  children,  she  will  meditate  on  how   323                precious are the souls and how dearly Jesus paid for them. If                she is a sacristan, she many lift up her mind to God and to                the Holy Sacrament continuously.                      Thus,  the  novice  will  strive  to  combine  the  practice  of                active life with contemplation (R.L.P.). (2)                          3. RULES TO RUN THE OFFICE WELL                      1. We have to receive any task from God and the most                holy Virgin's hands with faith and love, resolutely minding to                fulfill it with attention, intelligence and care.","2. Because we can do nohing without divine help as our                Lord Jesus Christ said: (< For you can do nothing without me                ))  (Jn.  15, 5), each  sister  should  invoke our  Lord, the most                holy Virgin, who is our divine mother superior, the guardian                angel, and the patron saints asking for enlightenment, help,                and grace to fulfill well her own task. To achieve this purpose                the sisters will say a vocal prayer in common, and each one                will say it with fervor and entreating heart: Besides, each will                pray  during  the  meditation,  the  Communion,  and  the  holy                mass  as  well  as  in  the  unfolding  of  her  task;  through                ejaculatory  prayer  and  invocations=she  will  ask  for                enlightenment,  help,  and  grace  so  that  she  may  overcome                the  difficulty,  see  clearly,  succeed  in  everything,  following                obedience and divine will perfectly for her personal good and                that  of  the  community.  When  this  prayer  is  made  while                performing one's own task, it is always of great efficacy and                draws special grace and enlightenment. The first invocation,                however, will be to the most holy name of Jesus, who will rule                all our actions well when we invoke him with faith.                      We  have  already  said  that  each  person  has  to  ac-  324                complish  her  task  not  only  diligently,  but  also  intelligently,                understanding  and  performing  everything  well.  Dull,  idiot                minds will never fulfill even the simplest task well, whereas an                intelligent  mind  may  always  open  to  the  light  of  grace.  For                that  reason,  please  do  not  accept  dull  persons  in  the                community.  However,  those  who  for  lack  of  intelligence  do                not know how to cope in singular cases, must learn to help                themselves through remote and present prayer, which will be                of  great  help  if  they  have  received  the  task  with  joy  and  a                resolute mind to succeed. Each one has to help herself with                prayer. When one finds herself in doubt or perplexity, besides                calling upon Jesus' name she should resort to the Mother of                Good Counsel,","by saying for instance: < Mother of Good Counsel, for Jesus'                sake,  your  beloved  son,  please  enlighten  me  on  how  to                behave,  how  to  resolve)),  or  the  like.  The  invocation  to  the                Mother of Good Counsel has been always effective beyond                belief because it opens even the dullest minds.                      Some  people  do  not  fulfill  their  tasks  exactly  because                they have not received the assignment from obedience  with                joy, a resolute mind, and faith, but also because they neglect                remote and present prayer. For that reason, they cannot lay                the  blame  on  incapacity,  but  on  their  negligence.  Besides                being  prayerful,  each  will  be  mindful  to  give  thanks  to  the                divine mercy for the good fulfillment of the task, and before                going to sleep everyone will thank God for the enlightenment                and the graces he granted them during the day to help them                fulfill their tasks, begging pardon for their faults.                      3. No one will refuse the task assigned nor will she be                reluctant  to  accept  it,  but  she  will  receive  it  pleasantly  and                quickly, regardless of whether she likes it or not. Neither will                she  find  excuses  in  sickness,  which  often  is  mistaken  for   325                selfishness. However, if someone faces difficulties in fulfilling                her  task,  she  may  submit  everything  with  simplicity  and                detachment to the mother superior, who will judge according                to the Lord's enlightenment and the knowledge she has about                the subject's disposition and state. At the end, the subject will                follow  the  mother  superior's  decision;  if  the  assignment  is                confirmed, she will receive it with faith from the hands of the                Lord  and  the  most  holy  Virgin,  regardless  of  the  health                reasons  or  anything  else,  being  sure  that  the  spirit  of                obedience  will  win  enough  grace  from  the  Lord  for  her                success.  If  she  surrenders  with  a  good  will  and  a  sincere                mind and","helps  herself  with  prayer,  she  will  be  able  to  fulfill  her  task                perfectly.                      4. If in fulfilling her duties by obedience and with joy or at                least with resignation the sister is absent from religious acts,                spiritual readings, etc. she loses no merit of the religious acts                from which she is absent, she rather deserves double merit                for  her  sacrifice.  Please  understand  that  the  community's                members  share  mutually  and  equally  in  the  merits  of  the                assignments, good works, and prayers; the one who performs                her  task  well  in  the  eyes  of  the  Lord  is  performing  all  the                assignments  of  the  others.  Because  the  community's  well                being consists in the perfect execution of the duties of all, the                person  at  fault  with  her  task  is  like  one  attempting  to  it,                whereas  the  one  performing  her  task  well  is  like  one                maintaining the whole house and, therefore, she deserves a                reward  from  God.  For  instance,  the  sister  cook  who  does                everything  on  time,  helps  the  community's  order;  if  she  did                otherwise, the people would be unable to do their duties on                time,  and  everything  would  go  upside  down.  Likewise,  the                sister employed an the clothes works for the community's life   326                and health; as a matter of fact, by being punctual she helps                the  congregants  in  the  performance  of  their  religious  acts,                discipline, etc.                      It's  all  the  same  for  anyone  performing  her task  in  the                community. Hence, each one must know with how much love,                diligence, attention, intelligence, fervor, and faith she has to                perform her task, how she has to receive it, and how she has                to help herself through remote and actual prayer.                      We have said above that the sister who is obliged by her                duties to be absent from religious acts, must not get vexed;                here we point out that the mother superior is","obliged by canon law to provide such a sister with appropriate                time for meditation.                      5.  Each  sister  will  beware  of  dispersing,  losing,  or                wasting the tools of her job; if it happens, she will confess her                fault to the mother superior or the treasurer.                      6.  To  have  the  necessary  provision  for  her  job,  each                sister  will  appeal  to  the  mother  superior  or  the  supervisor                without worrying, rushing, or pretending too much; when it is                possible, the officer will do her best making shift, instead of                claiming new objects, because everything must be done with                sobriety and economy.                      7. Everyone will avoid interfering with the task of others,                except for emergency cases when no time or no opportunity                is available to ask the permission.                      8.  Not  even  momentarily  can  anyone  entrust  another                with  the  task  they  have  received  from  the  mother  superior,                except for emergency cases, as we have said above.        327                      9. No one should long for high appointments by natural                disposition nor will they use means and subterfuge to reach                them. Is it true that a Religious may covet to be a superior or                to be appointed to an office of command, and she succeeds                reaching it? God forbid! It would be a pitiful ruin for the house                and  the  institute!  May each  stand  aloof  from  such  a  hellish                suggestion worthy of Lucifer, the father of pride, who wanted                to stand out over all the angels!                      10. When the mother superior is worried about the work                to  be  done,  the  sisters  can  volunteer  to  do  some  hard  or                humble work; in such a case competing and being available                according  to  obedience  is  worthy  of  praise,  and  everyone                must know that the hardest, humblest","tasks are the most desirable for a humble, fervent Religious.                      11.  The  lazy,  cowardly  youth  will  never  fulfill  her  task                well, and this fact is a sign of a feeble vocation or none at all;                therefore, she cannot be admitted to the taking of the sacred                garb, but must be dismissed, unless she amends. Due to lack                of  fervor  in  the  spiritual  life,  a  lazy,  coward  youth  is  even                unable to sweep a room, light a candle, etc.                      12. Those who are at fault in the fulfillment of their task                must be exhorted and taught about how to perform it well. If                they  are  stubborn,  they must  be  corrected by  penance and                mortification.  In  such  a  case,  the  touchiest  penance  is                depriving  the  lazy  person  of  her  office,  letting  her  eat  the                divine providence's bread in idleness.                      13. The mother superior, the teacher, and the treasurer                will see to it that in the changing of the officers, the former                one  will  hand  over  the  office,  explain  the  proceeding,  and                leave everything in order to the new officer.                                                                          328                     14. The new  officer  will  never  censure  the  former  one;                and  if  someone  did  so,  she  will  excuse  her!  Likewise,  the                former  officer  will  never  censure  the  new  one;  furthermore,                when  someone  is  against  her,  the  former  officer  will  speak                well and excuse her by saying that she is doing better than                herself.  This  way  we  keep  peace  and  the  Lord  blesses  us.                May God forbid the great fault of censuring! By censuring, the                transgressor would show she has not the religious spirit, but                the world's and the devil's spirit!                      15.  Everyone  will  keep  her  office  without  thinking  of                resigning. If one feels herself unable to keep it any longer, but                wishes humbler offices, she may pray, take","counsel  from  the  spiritual  director,  submit  her  idea  to  the                mother  superior,  and  then  will  follow  obedience.  Also  the                mother  superior  must  behave  this  way,  always  with  pure                intention (S:D.D.Z.).                                             NOTES                     (1) Each asphrant will be appointed to an office, and he wilt be most                diligent in fulfilling his duty. No one will claim a particular office, but will                humbly  accept  the one  that  obedience gives  him. Wishing and  asking                the lowest office as the most honorable before the Lord -is allowed, but                even  in  such  a  case  everyone  will  follow  obedience.  Negligence  in                fulfilling  the  office  is  considered  a  fault  more  or  less  serious,  and  is                punished even  with suspension  from  office. Each aspirant will comply                with his duty and will be in the divine presence in the spirit of humility                and obedience, as a practice of virtue. Oh, how many merits the aspirant                gains when he fulfills his duty this way (R.A.).                     (2) Each sister will be appointed to an office. The harmony of the                house depends on the perfect fulfillment of the offices. Each Religious                will commend herself to the most holy Virgin and to the guardian angel   329                every day in order to comply with her office perfectly. Knowing that she                is working for Jesus our Lord, the sister will apply all her attention and                zeal. She will waste neither object nor time; on the contrary, she will be                industrious and diligent. No one will get bored by her office nor will she                refuse it, will be rather perseverant in it, changing her office only when                obedience demands it.                    Each  one  will  strive  to  be  in  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  all.day                long, offering herself to him; even though she applies herself to various                things, she  will  not lose the  divine presence  in her own spirit, but  will                refer  everything  to  Jesus  crucified  and in  the  Holy Sacrament,  whose                divine presence is always within us (D.S.S.).","330","CHAPTER XIV                             DETACHMENT FROM RELATIVES                     I  declare  that  I  mean  to  live  in  this  pious  Institute                totally  detached  from  the  love  of  my  relatives  such  as                parents,  brothers,  sisters  as  well  as  from  love  for  my                native  country.  I  will  never  long  to  go  back  home,  not                even for a short time. If for a good reason I am obliged to                go,  I  will  submit  It  to  the  superiors  whose  advice  I  will                follow exactly and submissively.                    I will be also moderate either in writing or in claiming                letters or news from them; when I write to them, I will be                edifying  as  a  priest  and  Religious,  avoiding  too  much                familiarity and allowing my letters and messages to pass                through the hands of the superiors, as I have declared at                chapter VII: B. Obedience.                     When my relatives come to visit me, I will inform the                superiors so that they may take part In our conversation,                which  will  be  moderate  and  edifying,  because  of  my   331                suggestions to do good and to attend the sacraments. I                will  recommend  all  of  them  to  the  Lord,  especially  my                parents and my nearest relations, avoiding, however, to                have too much association with them, following our Lord                Jesus Christ's saying:                “Whoever comes to me cannot be my disciple unless he                hates his father and his mother, his wife and his children,                his brothers and his sisters, and himself as well” (Lk. 14,                26);  and  to  Holy  Spirit's  saying:  “Listen,  daughter,  pay                careful  attention:  forget  your  nation  and  your  ancestral                home” (Ps. 45, 11).                     Because  I  am  now  associated  with  the  brethren  by                religious bonds stronger than blood, I will hold them as                my  relatives,  saying  together  with  Jesus  my  Lord:                “Whoever does what God wants him to do is my brother,                my sister, my mother“ (Mc. 3, 5).","The  aspirants  will  always  love  their  relatives  with  pure                love  of  charity  and  piety  recommending  them  to  God;  still,                they  will  begin  detaching  themselves  from  the  natural                affections of blood. Those who are willing to belong totally to                Jesus  by  consecrating  themselves  to  his  service  in  the                priesthood or in the religious profession need to detach their                heart  from  natural  love  for  relatives  and  creatures.  God  is                jealous  of  the  souls  consecrated  to  Him:  He  wants  to reign                alone  in  their  hearts.  Jesus  our  Lord  is  our  father,  mother,                brother,  sister,  and  everything.  He  taught  us  this  holy                detachment in various ways.                      To accustom themselves to holy detachment, when the                aspirants mention their family house they will never say my                house,  but  will  say  my  relatives'  house,  because  for  my                house they must mean the institute.                      Since  the  relatives  in  their  letters  sometimes  use                unbecoming  language  or  relate  griefs  and  stories  which  do                not matter to the aspirants, a faithful summary of the letters                relating everything of the aspirants' concern will be made and   332                given  to  them,  and  the  aspirants  will  be  satisfied  with  that                (R.A.).                      The  novices  will  love  their  relatives  with  charity  and                piety,  recommending  them  to  God  and  caring  for  their                spiritual good, as much as they can (R.L.P.).                      Charity  toward  our  neighbor  urges  us  to  love  our                nearest, our relatives; but pure love of God and holy freedom                of  spirit  urges  us  to  live  detached  from  all  creatures,                especially from those who are connected by nature and blood                and could prevent us from union with God. The novices will                nurture  true  love  of  charity  and  piety  toward  their  relatives,                especially  the  nearest  ones,  but  will  endeavor  to  have their                heart detached from them to belong totally to Jesus, who is","father,  mother,  brother,  sister,  and  everything  for  the  souls                (R:L.P.). (1)                      A  person  who  leaves  the  world  to  devote  herself  to                Jesus Christ, must moderate the affections that bind or attract                her  to  her  relatives  and  must  purify  her  natural,  legitimate                love according to the virtue of charity and piety. She has to                love  her  relatives  in  God,  without  natural  tenderness  and                sensibility, but with strong and pure love recommending them                to the Lord and asking him to bless, sanctify, and save them.                The Daughters of Divine Zeal will not wish to see and write to                their  relatives  often,  but  they  will  also  avoid  negligence  by                writing now and then and by answering their letters. Either the                sisters see their relatives in the parlor or write to them, they                will behave and write as the Religious do. Through their talk                and  writing  they  will  exhort  their  relatives  to  attend  the                sacraments,  making  them  esteem  the  religion.  The  sisters,                however,  are  not  allowed  to  have  connections  with  their                distant relatives (C.D:D.Z.). (2)                      The sisters will be detached from all the people and from   333                everything,  seeking  Jesus  alone.  Not  worried  about  seeing                their  relatives,  they  will  recommend  them  to  the  Lord                peacefully. The sisters, however, must fulfill some filial duties                of convenience and piety toward their parents (D.S.S.).                      The  probationers  must  know  exactly  the  kind  of                relationship  they  may  have  with  their  relatives.  They  must                know that the beginning and the foundation of a true vocation                is holy detachment from relations of blood; therefore, they will                love  their  relatives  with  orderly  and  peaceful  affection  of                charity, which consists in recommending them to God for their                eternal salvation. They will also accustom themselves to hold                all  human  beings  as  relatives,  because  we  all  are  brothers                and sisters in","Jesus Christ. Beginning from now on they must understand                that  since  they  are  desiring  to  become  members  of  a                community which holds the orphans as beloved sons, and the                poor as beloved brothers, they must bear in mind our Savior's                saying: ((Whoever does what my Father in heaven wants him                to do is my brother, my sister, my mother)) (Mt. 12, 50); as                well as the saying of Jesus to the one who wished to go back                in order to bury his father: « Follow me and let the dead bury                their own dead » (Mt. 8, 22). (PAR.).

I will have correspondence with them on their saint's name,                on New Year's day, Easter, Christmas, and every time I have to answer                their letters.                                            334                     My  behavior  with  my  nearest  relations  or  benefactors  will  be  the                same; I will exhort them to the good, using a language appropriate to                -my vocation.                     I  promise  to  never hurry my  visit to  my parents' house nor  to  be                anxious to see them; when they come to visit me and obedience allows                it,  as  a  Religious  I  will  receive  them,  out  of  respect  and  pure  love,                behaving affably, affectionately, and kindly (D.P.).                     (2) The parents' mall will be summarized and handled by the sister                in  charge  of  it.  Each  sister  or  novice  or  probationer  will  be  glad  to                observe  this  rule;  besides,  no  Important  thing  will  be  left  out  in  the                summary.  This  rule  locks  the  door  to  the  world  and  to  the  devil,                preserving  the  fortunate  souls  who  are  consecrated  to  the  celestial                spouse * (C.D.D.Z./.                     (3) The probationers will never long nor claim to go to the parents'                house.  It  is  strictly  forbidden,  serious  cases  excepted.  To  meet  his                parents at the parlor, the probationer will go along with","the cleric assistant; such visits are allowed once a month to the close                relations, such as parents, uncles, and aunts; any other visit is strictly                forbidden.  In  these  circumstances,  the  probationers  will  behave                according to their vocation, avoiding to prolong the visit and cutting short                useless talk, in agreement with the cleric assistant. The probationer who                is interested in his parents' good, exhorts them wisely and respectfully                (P.R.P.).                                                                                             335","336","CHAPTER XV                      LOVE AND OBEDIENCE TO THE HOLY FATHER                     Through this 15th article and the following four I am                going  to  declare  and  promise  things  of  the  greatest                importance; even though they belong to the chapter VII:                B,  which  is  concerned  with  blind  obedience,  still                specifying them through five articles is more useful.                    To begin with: as a Christian by Lord's mercy, as a                priest  unworthy  of  the  Catholic  Church,  and  as  a                congregant of an institute aiming primarily at increasing                the priests, I declare that I will have the greatest respect,                an  unlimited  subjection,  and  subordination  to  the  Holy                Father. I will hold, love, and obey him as our Lord Jesus                Christ up to my last breath. The Holy Father's interests                will be my heart's living interests; his words, either said                outside  cathedra  or  privately,  will  be  oracles  of  eternal                salvation for me. His opinions and ways of thinking will                be the rule of my opinions and the ways of my thinking,                to which I will always conform myself. His sorrows and    337                pains will be mine.                    When  I  preach,  confess,  and  talk  I  will  instill  in  the                people  these  feelings  of  unlimited  subjection  and  filial                love toward Jesus Christ's vicar. The first intention I will                put In the mass, thanksgiving, divine office, meditation,                and  rosary  will  be  for  the  Holy  Father  along  with  his                intentions.  When  he  issues  encyclicals  or  delivers                speeches and I am fortunate to read them, I will conform                myself  to  his  feelings  obeying  exactly  what  he                commands or suggests. I will consider the Holy Father as                sacred  and  venerable,  and  if  I  am  fortunate  enough  to                see him, I will repute the opportunity of kissing his feet                and  even  the  dust  on  which  his  feet  trample  as  my                fortune.                    I have declared all this for the following reasons:                     1. Because I know that our Lord Jesus Christ wants                us to honor, love, and obey his vicar as his own person.","2.  Because the predominant spirit and the rule of                this humble  institute command it.                    3.    Because   I  feel   profondly  and   intimately  that                such things  must  be.                    4.   Because  the  perfect  subjection  to  the  Holy                Father brings about the Lord's blessing on each institute                and  each  soul, whereas  a lack of  this  subjection under                the pretext of these distinction  ex cathedra  and  not  ex                cathedra,  person and sacred character is the beginning                of serious faults for the individuals and the beginning of                ruin for the communities.                         1.    PROMOTING OBEDIENCE AND LOVE TOWARD                                 THE   HOLY   FATHER                     The  probationers  will  nurture  in  their  heart  the  most                profound  respect  and  the  most  perfect  subjection  to  their                immediate  superiors  and  to  the  ecclesiastical  hierarchy.  As   338                we  have  God's  holy  fear,  so  we  must  have  the  superiors'                reverential  fear.  Such  a  subjection  and  filial  fear  determine                the humility and mold the spirit of the people who long to be                members of a religious order. They will never speak ill of their                superiors  nor  censure  their  behavior,  and  when  they  notice                an evident defect, they will excuse them and avoid discussing                them.  This  way  they  show  their  gratitude  for  the  good  they                are receiving. The probationers will also keep in mind that the                divine  precept:  «  Honor  your  father  and  your  mother  »  (Ex.                20,  12)  implies  the  duties  toward  their  superiors  and  the                prayer for them. Therefore, they should pray every day for the                Holy Father, for whom they will nurture a particular transport                of love, faith, and subjection; for their bishop, holding him as                the one sent by God to the","diocese they belong to; for the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and                for their immediate superiors (P:R.P.).                     The  Rogationists  of  Jesus'  Heart  will  be  very  loving,                obedient  children  and  most  humble  subjects  of  the  holy                Church, which is represented by the Holy Father, the Roman                Sacred  Congregations,  the  prelates,  and  the  bishops  who                have juridical power over their religious houses.                     They  will  nurture  such  a  reverence,  subjection,  and                greatest tender love as to reach even veneration toward the                Holy  Father,  holding  him  as  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  whose                vicar he is, and his word, either written or spoken, as Jesus                Christ's word. They will make almost no distinction between                ex  cathedra  and  not  ex  cathedra,  holding  even  the  Holy                Father's  private  opinions  and  sentences  as  venerable.                Heartily  concerned  with  his  vicissitudes,  pains,  and  works,                they will recommend him to the most holy Heart of Jesus in                their  prayer  in  common.  On  his  patron  saint's  day,  his                birthday,  and  the  like,  they  will  present  their  homages  and                wishes,  also  publishing  articles  through  the  institute's                periodicals. While preaching or teaching Christian doctrine or                educating the youths, they will inspire .love, reverence, and   339                obedience to the Holy Father, giving lectures on the doctrine                about the Roman pontiff and his infallibility, as well as calling                to mind the ecclesiastical history's glorious events, which are                related to the supreme pontiffs (C.R.).                      Each superior will give example of unlimited veneration                and  of  warmest,  sacred  affection  toward  the  Holy  Father,                seeing to it that the whole community be devoutly happy for                the  supreme  pontiff's  consolations,  but  sympathetic  for  his                pains. He will encourage the people to read the Holy Father's                encyclicals,  speeches,  and  above  all  the  dispositions  which                bind them under the obligation of conscience (R:S.).","2. THE PAPAL INFALLIBILITY                      The  holy  Church  is  formed  by  those  who  believe  in                Jesus  Christ,  and  who  acknowledge  the  supreme  pontiff,                beginning with St. Peter, as the chief of the Catholic Church.                      The holy Church is classified into two categories; those                who teach and those who learn. They are united by faith and                form  the  mystical  body  of  Jesus  Christ,  the  invisible  head,                while the supreme pontiff is the visible one.                      Those who teach consist of the Holy Father along with                the bishops who are united with him. Those who learn are the                believers who are baptized. Like children they are fed by the                holy mother, the Catholic Church, with the doctrine and with                the grace which comes from Jesus Christ's sacraments. So                that  the  teaching  Church  could  exercise  her  .power  with                divine  authority,  Jesus  Christ  endowed  it  with  his  eternal                priesthood,  not  a  simple  power,  but  the  power  of  the                sacrament  of  Holy  Orders.  Holy  Orders  bestow  an  eternal                character  in  the  priest's  soul,  as  in  Jesus  Christ.  This   340                character is conveyed by bishop to bishop and by bishops to                priests through the ritual of the sacrament.                      When a person is ordained a priest, he is endowed with                the power to forgive the sins of the people who humbly repent                and  sincerely  confess  in  the  sacrament of  reconciliation, as                well as to consecrate the body and blood of Jesus Christ in                the mass, distributing them to the faithful in the sacrament of                the Eucharist.                     All  this  is  clear,  sanctioned  in  the  holy  gospel,  and                entrusted to the holy Church.                     Were bishops and priests to depart from Jesus Christ's                teaching or to teach errors, faith would be lost","and  hell  would  prevail  over  it.  To  prevent  such  an  evil,  our                Lord promised the Holy Spirit's assistance to the head of the                holy Church, who is the legitimate guardian of the Evangelical                doctrine and is supported by God in order to ensure that the                faithful stand in the truth.                     This  is  the  dogma  on  papal  infallibility,  whose  name                makes an impression on many people, far they think of it as                of  a  personal  impeccability  or  of  an  impossibility  of  being                mistaken intellectually, in any case or circumstance. But the                meaning  of  this  dogma  is  not  that.  As  a  human  being,  the                supreme pontiff may sin as we do, and history gives us such                examples.  Nor  does  the  dogma  means  that  the  pope  is                unable to be mistaken or to blunder even when he publishes                books  on theology,  because  in  such  a  case  he  would be  a                private doctor, subject to error as anyone else.                         Then, what is papal infallibility all about?                     It  consists  in  this:  when  the  supreme  pontiff  defines                some  truths  of  faith  or  dictates  some  rules  of  morals  ex                cathedra, that is to say, as the universal shepherd of the holy   341                Church,  then  God  gives  him  a  particular  assistance                preventing  him  from  errors.  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  is                God  equal  to  the  Father  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  promised  this                assistance to the first pontiff St. Peter and to his successors                so that they might teach uprightly both the rules of faith and of                morals to those who depend on their ministry, either bishops                or priests or faithful.                     Nothing  seems  to  be  impossible  in  this  doctrine.                Otherwise  it  would  be  like  saying  that  God cannot give  this                particular  assistance  to  His  vicar  he  left  on  earth  as  His                representative, as the chief of His Church, as the surest guide                in  faith  and  morals  for  the  holy  Church's  members.  It  goes                without saying that God is able to","endow  the  head  of  the  holy  Church  with  this  particular                assistance, not for his personal good, (1) but for the universal                good of believers.                      The  truth  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  promised  this                particular  assistance  to  the  supreme  pontiff  for  maintaining                mankind in faith and to strengthen it in good Christian morals                is  clear,  definite,  and  evident  in  the  gospel.  To  deny  it  is                temerity  and  stubborness,  not  the  process  of  a  rational                person.                      1n Mt. 16, 19 we read that Jesus said to Peter: « I will                give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; what you prohibit                on  earth  will  be  prohibited  in  heaven;  what  you  permit  on                earth  will  be  permitted  in  heaven.  r  This  is  the  divine                assistance in the rules of morals we are talking about.                     In  Lk.  22,  32,  before  Peter  denied  Jesus  three  times                (here is the personal peccability), Jesus said to him: « When                you  turn  back  to  me,  you must  strengthen your  brothers.  »                Before going to death, he said to his apostles: « Satan has                received permission to test all of you, as a farmer separates   342                the wheat from the chaff. But I have prayed for you, Simon,                that your faith will not fall)) (Lk. 22, 31-32).                      Raised from the dead, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared                to  the  apostles,  and  to  make  Peter  repair  his  three  denials                asked him three times: « Simon, son of John, do you love me                more than these? » « Yes, Lord,)) he answered, « you know                that  I  love  you.))  Jesus  said  to  him:  «  Take  care  of  my                lambs.)) A second time Jesus said to him, « Simon, son of                John, do you love me?)) « Yes, Lord,)) he answered, « you                know that I love you.)) Jesus said to him, « Take care of my                sheep.))  A  third  time  Jesus  said,  «  Simon, son  of  John,  do                you love","me?)) Peter became sad because Jesus asked him the third                time « ~Do you love me?)) and said to him, < Lord, you know                everything; you know that I love you!)) Jesus said to him, «                Take  care  of  my  sheep))  (Jn.  21,  15-17).  The  sheep                represent  the ecclesiastics,  who  generate  the  faithful  to  the                life of grace; the lambs represent the faithful.                      Our  Lord  appointed  the  supreme  pontiff  to  feed  souls                and  pledged  to  assist  him  as  his  vicar  on  earth  so  that  he                may provide the faithful with a goad, holy pasture. God was                able  to  give  this  particular  assistance,  it  was  convenient  to                give  it,  and  he  has  being  giving  it  for  over  20  centuries;  in                fact,  no  supreme  pontiff,  even  though  guilty  of  unbecoming                behavior, was mistaken in his teaching of faith and morals.                      Had it been otherwise, what would have happened to the                Church of Jesus Christ? Unity of faith and rules of morals for                the good and eternal life would have long since been lost! In                order  to  maintain  the  teaching  in  faith  and morals,  the  holy                Church,  through  the  Holy  Father,  allowed  entire  nations  to                depart from faith through their fault rather than to compromise   343                the  principles.  It  happened,  for  instance,  when  Henry  VItI                asked to annul his marriage with Catherine of Aragon and to                approve his union with Anne Boleyn.                      Owing  to  its  divine  institution,  the  holy  Church  and  its                pontificate has prevailed over the persecutions, especially in                the first three centuries, always standing firm in union with his                legitimate chief, according to the promise of -Jesus Christ to                St. Peter: ((And so I tell you: you are a rock, Peter, and on                this  rock  foundation  I  will  build  my  Church,  which  not  even                death will ever be able to overcome)) (From the letter to the                friends).","3. DEFINITION OF THE DOGMA                              OF PAPAL INFALLIBILITY (2)                      A  word  of  life  has  been  pronounced  in  the  Vatican                Council; a word, which three hundred million Catholics longed                for, has started going all over the world.                      It is an enactment of truth, a watch word centralizing the                Catholic  children  around  unity  of  faith,  the  seal  of  a  belief                1900 years old, the beginning of a new moral regeneration of                mankind.  Oh,  no  one  is  able  to  hear  it  without  feeling  his                heart  beating  with  celesial  exultation.  It  is  expanding                throughout the world. No sooner does it come from the mouth                of God's one thousand priests, the faithful echo repeats the                gentle expression in the four corners of the world.                          Infallible! Rome's gentle breezes echo.                         Infallible! Cities, people, and nations answer.                         Infallible! Sea, sky, and stars repeat.                         Infallible! Paradise's angels sing.                                                                          344                     Oh, God's mysteries! Today, Christ's bride has set up a                scepter before which the people must bow their head, the just                in  gladness,  the  injust  in  anger:  the  scepter  is  the  papal                infallibilty's sacred dogma, indisputable defense of his divine                rights.                      Today, impiety received the most terrible defeat from the                moral  power  it  tried  in  vain  to  shake  on  its  firm  rock.  Oh,                God's  mysteries!  We  have  witnessed  how  the  depraved                society  got  up  as  a  man  alone  in  his  frenzy  against  this                invincible  power,  throwing  against  it  the  hellish  fiercest                arrows.  Today  was  the  time  when  frenzy  seemed  like                touching the highest point of its madness: so many sects in                error, so many different unbelief joined each other to knock                down the base of all authorities. Human impotence!","Today,  a  different  result  appears  before  the  eyes  of  all                Catholics. Christ's bride holds its head high on the failure of                the  dust.  Almost regardless  of  the  waves  of  apposition,  the                Church always achieves its aims, it is always a winner. The                world  seemed  so  agitated  as  if  to  impede  that  word  from                coming  out  of  the  Vatican;  there  was  a  moment  when  the                earthly powers seemed to be opposing its great design; but                God  came  down  to  help.  By  now,  the  earthly  powers  are                under  the  incubus  of  a  mysterious  hand,  they  are  about  to                lacerate each other, intercrossing one another with a vortex                of  wars  .and  blood;  (3)  Jesus  Christ's  Church  alone,  the                gentlest mother of mankind, looks at the failings of the human                beings  from  its  highness,  running  to  save  them  from  the                abyss. Yes! It already begins its great work; the world sees it                advancing majestic and writing on the .papacy's diadem this                word that orders afresh the moral life of the peoples: infallible!                     Hail, o divine word! Expected for many centuries, today                you  elate  us  with  superhubman  jay.  Touched  and  reverent,                we kneel down before you. We join the Catholics' universal                vow,  and  looking  at  Peter's  infallible  cathedra  we  say:  we                greet  you,  immortal  Pius  IX,  the  universal  Church's  doctor,'   345                Christ's  vicar,  the mystical  bride's  sublime guardian,  Peter's                boat's celesial pilot; at last, we greet you, glorious pontiff, that                in 24 splendid years sublimated your name, which is a new                pearl in the coming history and a sacred glory of posterity; we                greet you, loving father, and with the five regions of the earth                we salute you five times great! Five times infallible!                               4. THE PAPACY IN LEO XIII                      ...When  the  social  vertigo  was  at  its  summit,  when  the                storm of human fortunes threatened to overthrow Peter's","boat  along  with  the  .people's  hopes  of  well-being,  a  great,                splendid, shining star appeared in the clear sky of Rome. The                prophetic saying ((Light in the sky)) sent forth its rays and for                25  years  rarified  darkness,  illuminated  minds  and  hearts,                cooled down brutal passions, induced esteem and respect to                the  Church  of  Christ,  spreading  the  truth  and  religion.  It                helped  afflicted  humankind,  lifted  up  prostrated  hopes  to                heaven, reminded human beings of their duties toward God,                toward  themselves,  and  toward  their  neighbor.  It  provided                thousands  of  people  with  spiritual  well-being,  calling  the                attention  of  the  powerful  to  the  importance  of  the  respect                which  is  due  to  the  papal  authority,  as  the  base  and  the                guarantee of any civil authority.                      'If  the  Papecy's  age-long  institution  were  nothing  else                than  a  human  institution,  the  difficulties  that  opposed  the                pontiff 'Leo XI14's glories would have been insurmountable.                But Church and papacy are not human, but divine institutions:                they  have  a  vigor  of  their  own,  always  new,  active,  young,                renovating itself when it seems to be dying out. Church and                papacy are the miracle of God's hand, the great unshakable   346                building cemented by the blood of God-man, who swore once                forever to Peter, the first supreme pontiff: cc And so I tell you:                you are a rock, Peter, and on this rock foundation I will build                my  church,  which  not  even  death  will  ever  be  able  to                overcome)) (Mt. 16, 18).                      The great pontiff, whose loss we mourn, showed again                the  infallibility  of  this  divine  promise  that  never  failed  in  19                centuries.  Born  pontiff  under  severe  test  and  tribulation,  he                inherited the holy cross that his glorious predecessor, Cross                from  Cross,  left  to  him.  He  embraced  the  cross  willingly,                swearing to die over it rather than to come to terms on the                Church's rights.","The papacy's moral power, through Leo XI-11, prevailed                over earthly powers: it was not only a rapprochement of the                peoples, but also of kings and emperors as representatives of                their nations; God's marvelous ways always reach the same                aim through different paths!                      God once showed that the Church's spiritual power may                turn itself intro so strong an earthly power as to get the upper                hand. The severe Hildebrand, moved by the omnipotent spirit                of  God,  throws  down  the  emperor  Henry's  forces. Firm  and                unshakable, he leaves the king crying outside the door of his                castle  in  sackloth  and  ashes,  and  then  admits  the  humble,                trembling,  and  tearful  king  into  his  presence.  At  last,  he                forgives and rehabilitates him.                      Many people will say: those were different times. Today                civil and military powers are stronger, and the papacy must                be  subordinate.  No,  gentlemen!  Today,  the  papacy  is  as                strong as it was in the Middle-Ages. His two hundred million                children,  at  a  sign  of  the  Haly  Father,  would  become  two                hundred million crusaders, and would not shrink from giving   347                their life for the pope in the battlefields.                     However,  this  is  not  the  Church's  army.  Peter  knows                how to handle the sword, but from the time Jesus Christ told                him: « Put your sword back in its place... Don't you know that                I could call on my Father for help and at once he would send                me  more  than  twelve  armies  of  angels?))  (Mt.  26,  52-53).                Since  then  the  papacy  has  understood  its mission  on  earth                and the weapons it must use to win the people.                      Leo  XII,I  understood  very  well  this  divine  mission.  He                grew warlike with the strongest spiritual weapons. He put on                the  breastplate  of fortitude  and  constancy,  the  shield of  the                evangelical  doctrine  along  with  holiness  of  its  rights,  the                helmet of the Catholic faith's greatest ideas,","and brandishing the double-edged sword of the divine ward,                he entrusted himself to the spirit of wisdom and to Christian                meekness, entered the struggle, and won.                      -  We  won't  go  to  Canossa  -  the  most  illustrious                state-man of the German empire said; but he went twice: first,                when  he  was  compelled  to  meet  the  just  requests  of  the                empire's Catholics; second, when he put the controversy with                Spain about the Caroline Islands in the wise arbitration of Leo                XIfI.  In  such  a  circumstance,  the  MiddleAges  saw  the                Church's power standing out among the nations, and seemed                to be rising again.                      Gentlemen,  what  made  this  poor,  unarmed  man  so                powerful  before  the  rules,  who  by  principles  and  systems                were the most alien' to the Catholic religion? What was inside                this old man who in 25 years attracted not only the greatest                enthusiasm  of  his  faithful  subjects,  but  also  the  admiration,                the respect, and perhaps the affection of non-Catholic nations                as  well  as  of  celebrities?  How  this  frail,  candid  man                fascinated in such a way that the rakish world thrilled twice   348                with reverence, pity, and almost filial care on the occasion of                his sickness?                      To answer this question, we put another one. How can                we  explain  that  nineteen  centuries  ago,  a  .poor  fisher  from                Galilee,  known  as  a  shy,  weak  man,  bare-footed  and                bare-headed enters the Rome of the Caesars, resides there,                and plants the seeds of a doctrine before which the idols of                the Pantheon would be reduced to dust? The Church is God's                power,  this  is  the  mystery;  the  supreme  pontiff  is  a                human-divine being, the vicar of the Godman.                      When  the  Italian  parliament  began  discussing  the                iniquitous bill on divorce, Leo's heart was pierced by a sharp                sword. He wrote a most learned, imposing encyclical","pointing to the deadly consequences of a iaw contrary to the                principles of morals and social order.                     Once,  while  talking  to  the  cardinals  about  the  impious                bill, his voice fainted suddenly, a painful Kiccuip came out of                his chest, and tears came down from his eyes. Jesus' vicar                exclaimed  in  tears:  «  Not  even  my  last  gray  hairs  are                respected; they do not spare me such a deadly blow! )) A few                months later, the unvanquished Leo subsided into the bed of                his last sickness.                     Gentlemen, was Leo XII~I a martyr? Did the people who                cooperated  in  driving  him  to  the  tomb  feel  a  beneficial                remorse? I do not know; a mysterious comparison, however,                hits me.                      When  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  betrayed  by  Judas,                condemned  by  the  impious  Jews,  and  nailed  to  the  cross                breathed  his  last  crying  aloud,  a  beneficial  change  of  heart                resulted in a few. One of the two thieves crucified at Jesus'                side,  touched  by  the  patience  of  that  just  one  who  died                forgiving  his  enemies, repented,  acknowledged  him  as  God                and  asked  that  he  be  allowed  to  share  in  his  kingdom.   349                Contemplating at the foot of the cross the celestial features of                the divine victim, the centurion exclaimed: < ~He really was                the Son of God! » Some of the Hebrews who were standing                there came down from the hill beating their breasts!                      Recently,  Jesus  Christ's  vicar  died  after  a  wretched,                crucified life inside the walls of his uninterrupted dwelling, and                his last day appeared to be a rehearsal of the judgment on                the reprobate and the elect.                      Many adversaries of the papacy, who opposed the pope                 through  the  press,  and  others  who  disagreed  because  of                 different  religious  ideas  awakened  exclaiming  before  the                 venerable remains of the sacred, illustrious dead: c He really                 was Jesus Christ's vicar! » But, others remained                 impassive!  There  are  Hebrew  crucifiers  that  persist  in  their                devilish hate against the pope, whatever may be his name,","Pius  or  Leo  or  Gregory;  others  are  hopeless;  others  run  to                hang themselves as Judas did!                     These  are  children  of  perdition,  destined  to  the                Gehenna's  fire;  but  those  of  gentle  heart  who  love  Jesus                Christ's  vicar,  have  their  name  written  in  the  book  of  life                (From the funeral oration on Leo XII~I)!                                              NOTES                     (1) It is a personal privilege, because the Holy Father cannot give it                to others; it is not a personal privilege, because it was granted for the                universal, not for his own good.

Everything  a  Roman  congregation                says or decrees or decides upon or manifests will be like                an  infallible  oracle  for  me.  Suffering  no  theological                distinctions  between  major  or  minor  Importance  of  the                topics,  I  will  accept  everything  as  simply  as  a  child                accepts  the  explanations  and  the  orders  from  his                teacher.                      Holding  that  the  Holy  Spirit  assists,  governs,  and                speaks through the sacred congregations, I will quickly                conform my opinions and doctrine to any Roman sacred      351                congregation's  opinions  and  sentences with firm  belief.

Among other things he said: «When we                face  certain  contradictions  or  admonitions  from  highest  ecclesiastical                authorities, such as the Roman congregations, we must highly stand in                awe,  be  profoundly  humble,  and  devoutly  prudent  because  they                represent  the  Holy  Father.  In  these  events  we  must  not  consider  the                circumstances that brought about that admonition or contradiction from                the  Church's  prelates.  God  makes  use  of  so  many  tools,  but  the                decisions of the Church's high prelates are the work of the Holy Spirit                governing the Church. By renouncing our judgment we have to reprove                with a will what the Church reproves.» Since the Abbot Combe had a                mind to write a biography of Melania, our padre pointed out the outline of                the  work,  but  concluded:  «The  holy  Church's  judgment  excepted,  in                which  I  believe  more  than  in  my  eyes  and  hands»  (Letter,  Aug.  15.                1907).                                                                                352","CHAPTER XVII                             LOVE AND OBEDIENCE TO THE                             ECCLESIASTICAL HIERARCHY                         I  declare  that  I  will  hold  the  ecclesiastical                hierarchy  as  holy  and  celestial,  being  highly  respectful                and subject to the holy Church's prelates, especially the                cardinals  and  the  bishops;  to  the  former,  as  to  the                Church's  princes,  and  to  the  latter,  as  to  the  apostles'                successors, the highest priests of Jesus Christ's Church,                the vigilant guardians of the mystical Israel.                         I  will  always  speak  well  of  the  holy  Church's                prelates. If someone had evident defects, I will excuse or                conceal them. As unworthy as I am, I will pray to God for                the  holy  Church's  illustrious  prelates,  especially  for  the                cardinals and the bishops who are governing.                         Since  this  humble  order  is  endowed  with  the                particular grace and privilege of having the Ecclesiastical   353                Sacred  Alliance  of  the  holy  Church's  most  illustrious                prelates as well as of the clergy, I declare that I will have                at  heart  this  Sacred  Alliance  In  order  to  foster  our                Institute as much as I can.                        Finally, as a professed member of the Evangelical                Rogation  of  Jesus'  Heart,  I  declare  that  through  the                order's prayers I will ask the most holy Heart of Jesus to                always  send  out  learned,  holy  cardinals  and  prelates                along  with  bishops  full  of  excellent  virtues  to  the  holy                Church and to the dioceses.                       The  ecclesiastical  hierarchy  is  the  high  pyramid  God                planted  on  earth.  It  challenges  the  centuries,  rarefies                darkness  of  human  errors  with  its  splendor,  watches  the                generations which file off kneeling humbly before itself along                with  the  multitudes,  the  princes,  kings,  and  emperors.  The                steps of these mysterious stairs are steps","of  divine,  not  human  glory,  implying  a  mission  of  great                sacrifice and self-denial.                     The man God transfers on the ecclesiastical hierarchy's                highness,  experiences  a  supernatural  transformation  and  a                celestial  power  in  his  innermost  self.  He  feels  himself                connected  with  divinity;  the  sevenfold  Spirit  fulfills,                spiritualizes, elates, moves, and thunders as he once did with                the  prophet  Jeremiah:  «  Look,  today  I  am  setting  you  over                nations and over kingdoms, to tear up and to knock down, to                destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant » (Jer. 1, 10).                The anointed of the Lord may say as the prophet: « God put                fire  in  my  bones  and  taught  me  the  mission  »  (From  the                funeral oration on Card. Guarino).                                                                                 354","CHAPTER XVIII                           OBEDIENCE TO ONE'S OWN BISHOP                      In a special way and more than the other bishops I                promise to honor, love, respect, and obey with humblest                submission  the  bishop  of  the  diocese  where  I  reside,                because  the  community  depends  on  him  canonically.                Whether our order Is by law diocesan or not, (1) I mean to                respect and hold the rights that papal bulls or canon law                give  to  the  bishops  on  the  order  and  its  members,                because  these  rights  bind  me  to  perfect  subjection,                esteem, respect, love, and trust. I will hold the bishop as                superior  general  or  mayor  within  the  bounds  and  the                exercise of these rights and relative duties, obeying and                respecting him by preference.                      The  congregants  will  hold  the  holy  Church's  most                eminent  cardinals  and  prelates  as  the  holy  Church's                princes and lords.                                                                          355                      They  will  highly  esteem  the  bishops,  holding  them  as                the successors to the apostles as well as the ones that the                Holy  Spirit  appointed  to  govern  Jesus  Christ's  Church.                Above all, they will esteem, revere, and love the bishops of                the  dioceses  where  we  have  houses,  obeying  and                respecting  their  orders  in  everything  concerning  their                competence (C.R.).                     The  superior  of  the  house  will  show  great  respect  and                subjection  to  the  ordinary,  paying  to  him  the  community's                wishes  on  his  saint's  day,  New  Year,  Christmas,  etc.  and                respecting his orders humbly, simply, and prudently (R.S.).                                            NOTES                     (1)  Keep  in  mind  that  our  padre  was  writing  in  1910,  when  the                canonical approval of the orders was only a wish; in practical terms, they                were pious associations depending on the Messina ordinary.","356","CHAPTER XIX                      OBEDIENCE TO THE INSTITUTE'S SUPERIORS                     To conclude the declarations I made in the chapters                XV-XVIII about the practice of holy obedience along with                subjection,  subordination,  esteem,  and  affection toward                the  ecclesiastical  hierarchy,  I  pledge  my  obedience,                respect,  esteem,  love,  and  trust  in  this  institute's                superiors  as  an  immediate  norm  of  my  actions.  The                institute's  superiors  are  the  superior  general  and  his                representatives who have power over me.                     Not  only  will  I  be  a  dependent  subject,  but  also  a                loving  son  in  Jesus  Christ,  holding  dependence  and                subordination  in  the  highest  esteem  and  considering                them as the  base of the Institute's existence and of my                religious life.                     To  honor  the  high  order  of  dependency  God                established  when  He  created  humankind  and  society,   357                under  which  the  human  beings  find  safety  and  truth  in                depending on each other; I will glory in my dependence. I                will also glory in it to honor our Lord Jesus Christ, who                made  himself  subject  to  his  creatures,  teaching  and                establishing  dependence  on  ecclesiastical  and  civil                authorities in order to abate human pride, as the psalmist                said: « Let the nations know they are only men » (Ps. 10,                21); as well as the apostle: « Every high priest is chosen                from his fellow-men and appointed to serve God on their                behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins » (Heb. 5. 1).                     I will hold my subordination and affection toward the                holy Father, the sacred congregations, the holy Church's                prelates,  and  the  ordinary  as  a  false  subordination,                unless I am a perfect subordinate and have sincere filial                affection toward my immediate superiors. In reference to                the people who have no love for neighbor, St. John says                If you do not love your neighbor whom you see, how can                you claim that you love God, who Is Invisible? Likewise I                will say to myself:","how can I be respectful, obedient, and loving toward the Holy                Father  and  the  Church's  prelates  who  are  far-off,  if  I  do  not                esteem,  obey,  listen  to,  love,  nor  want  to  be  subject  to  my                Immediate superiors, who are always with me? I will repute any                feeling  of  reaction  to  my  superiors  and  their  orders  as  the                beginning of a revolt prompted by Lucifer, who rose against the                divine power and now upsets the communities by rousing the                spirit of pride in the subjects.                    If a lay-brother (1) is appointed to the superior's office, as                some  institutes  do  for  practice  of  humility  and  obedience,  I                declare that I will listen to, obey, and be subject to him with the                same spirit of subordination, respect, and humility which is due                to any other superior.                    I  will  greatly  trust  in  the  superiors,  sometimes  confiding                my pains and temptations to them with simplicity as a son does                with his father, believing that by doing so God will bend, giving                me his consolations. Great as may be the gifts I was given by                God,  I  will  be  like  a  child  in  my  relation  with  the  superiors,                putting  myself  in  their  hands  In  order  to  follow  the  celestial                teaching: « Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like                a child will never enter it » (Mc. 10, 15).                    By  behaving  so  I  mean  to  avoid  seeking  consideration                from my superiors in order that they may command and direct   358                me  freely.  On  the  other  hand,  I  will  glory  in  obeying  and                listening to them, remembering the words that Jesus spoke to                his  disciples  and  to  those  who  are  legitimately  placed  at  the                head  of  the  Church:  «  Whoever  listens  to  you,  listens  to  me;                whoever rejects you, rejects me » (Lk 10, 16).                    I  will  receive  advice  and  Instructions,  admonitions  and                reproaches  or  penances  from  my  superiors  as  though  Jesus                Christ himself were acting or speaking through their mouth.                    When  priests  or  brothers  or  young  students  are  around                me,  I  will  fear  setting  bad  examples  of  insubordination,  and                strive to consolidate both the authority and the government of                my superiors whenever it is possible, even with my abasement                and  humiliation.  When  I  see,  greet,  call,  treat,  answer  my                superiors  or  I  receive  their  orders  and  the  like,  I  will  use  the                signs of respect that are customary in our institute.                    To conclude this important article, I resolve to never long                for any power. On the contrary I will try to refuse it with humility                and prudence when my superiors want to confer","it  on  me;  however,  If  holy  obedience  obliges  me,  I  will                accept it- Should the Lord permit my election, and holy                obedience compel me to accept any power or jurisdiction                on others, since now I declare that I will repute myself as                the servant and the last one of all, feeling myself obliged                to  be  the  first  in  the  observance,  In  the  practice  of                religious  virtues,  in  self-denial,  and  to  settling  good                example. Should It happen, I will hold my office with fear                and  trembling,  praying  continuously  to  the  Lord  for                enlightenment  and  help.  I  will  keep  in  mind  the  holy                writers' rules  about prudence, discretion, and charity In                governing  as  well  as  about  the  zeal  and  strength                necessary to avert or atone offences to God, to eliminate                abuse, oppose slackening even In small things, and put                down the obstinate.                                  1. THE DIVINE SUPERIORS                                                                          359                    The  present  and  future  Rogationists  will  hold  the                Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jests  and  the  most  holy  Immaculate                Mary  as  immediate,  absolute,  effective  superiors  always                present in the midst of them, even though invisible, according                to the proclamations on July 1 and 2, 1913. The Rogationists                will see them in each order, command, and direction of the                superiors who have power over them. Reading the rules and                the  constitutions,  they  will  learn  each  article  as  though                Immaculate Mary were reading and instilling them on  behalf                of the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus. Before any common action,                they  will  say  the  Latin  prayer  Sacratissimum,  holding  as  a                secret of the institute the ineffable grace of the double, divine,                absolute,  effective,  immediate,  celestial  superiority,  invisible                to  the  senses,  but  visible  in  the  external  direction  of  the                legitimate superiors. Everyone will keep it in his heart saying:                my secret is for me, as well as: it is","right  to  conceal  the  secret  of  the  king  and  of  the  queen  of                heaven (Rules according to the two proclamations).                      The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  never  forget  that  on                Dec.  8,  1904  (50th anniversary  of  Immaculate  Conception's                dogma)  the  institute  of  Divine  Zeal  elected  and  solemnly                proclaimed  Immaculate  Mary  as  the  everlasting  owner,                mother, teacher, as well as the absolute, effective, immediate                superior of the Daughters of Divine Zeal's community... From                then on, the Daughters of Divine Zeal have been holding and                will  always  hold  the  most  holy  Virgin  as  the  effective,                absolute,  immediate,  but  invisible  superior  oaf  this  least                order.  They  have  sworn  to  hold  the  visible  superior  as                Immaculate Mary's vicar, binding themselves to honor, love,                and obey her as the most holy Virgin.                      The  noble,  holy  office  of  Immaculate  Mary's  vicar  first                resides in the mother superior general; second, in the house                mother superiors, who are subject to the mother general. To                enjoy  the  good,  singular  fortune  of  having  the  most  holy                Virgin as the effective superior, the Daughters of Divine Zeal   360                must  honor,  love,  and  obey  the  house  mother  superior  and                the mother general as the most holy Virgin Mary (C.D.D.Z.).                               2. RESPECT AND OBEDIENCE                      I  promise  perfect  obedience,  subordination,  holy  af-                fection,  and  profound  respect  toward  the  institute's  present                and  future  mother  superior,  holding  her  as  the  most  holy                Virgin's vicar. I promise the same obedience, subordination,                respect, and holy affection toward anyone, either sister or lay-                person, who is appointed to direct or supervise me, holding                that  the  legitimate  direction  or  surveillance  is  coming  from                God anal the most holy Virgin (D. P.).","The novices will consider their superior as their mother,                nurturing filial love and respect for her. First, they will show                love and esteem by obeying exactly and by anticipating her                thoughts and wishes; second, by recommending her to God                particularly;  third,  by  helping  her.  They  will  avoid  to  disgust                her even in the least things, knowing that whoever disgusts                the superiors, disgusts God. If the mother superior happened                to  fall  into  defects,  the  novices  will  not  wonder  nor  talk  to                each other about it, because no one is perfect; they instead                will excuse and fervently recommend her to God (R.L.P.).                      I  promise  to  put  myself  under  the  obedience  of  the                institute's director and his legitimate representatives, whether                they  are  lay-persons  or  younger  than  myself  or  imperfect,                holding them as Jesus Christ and behaving like a child with                docility  and  simplicity  of  heart  when  they  guide,  direct,                command,  admonish,  and  correct  me.  I  also  mean  to                renounce  and  silence  my  will,  judgment,  and  opinion  when                they are in bad terms with my superior's will, judgment, and                opinion.                                                                          361                     Never  will  I  be  desirous  to  command,  reaching  to  be                superior over anyone, to be  praised, and esteemed. On the                contrary,  I  have  a  resolute  mind  to  sanctify  myself,  seek                Jesus, and totally belong to him by loving the last place, by                being disappointed, ignored, and humiliated (P.D.P.).                                 3. SEEKING THE LAST PLACE                         No  one  will  long  for  honor  and  directorship,  but  will                avoid honor, approbation, and superiority because ambition is                the soul's death; only when obedience appoints a Rogationist                to an office, he will accept it (C.R.).                         You shall not desire the superior's office. Desiring","the  superior's  office  and  intriguing  to  have  it  (God  forbid!)                would be a serious fault worthy of God's indignation! It would                be eternal damnation for you and ruin for the house! Instead,                everyone  will  dislike  having  the  superior's  office  or  any                superiority over other people. No one will forget that we have                to  seek  the  last  place,  as  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  taught  us.                Even though he was God, he put himself in the place of the                evildoers, dying between two murderers! Only whoever loves                the  last  place,  will  be  told:  «  Come  on  up,  my  friend,  to  a                better place » (Lk. 14, 10). Were a Religious to long for the                superior's office or for any superiority, God would give him no                help and he would be mistaken over and over again.                      When  God's  will  is  manifested  by  ballot,  or  obedience                compels the Religious to accept the superior's office or any                position  of  superiority,  the  Religious  must  feel  himself                unworthy  of  it  and  receive  it  from  the  Lord's  hands  as  a                burden and a punishment of his sins; he must consider the                appointment  as  an  office  of  service  toward  others,  not  a                superiority.  From  the  very  beginning  he  must  conform  to                God's adorable will and trust in the infinite goodness of the   362                most holy Heart of Jesus for the best execution of his duty,                saying specific prayers to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, to                the  angels  and  the  saints  to  win  the  grace  and  the                enlightenment he needs (R.S.).                      The mother-superior will meditate on these words of our                Lord Jesus Christ: whosoever is first among you, shall be as                the  last  one.  On  one  hand,  she  will  keep  the  superior's                authority  in  order  to  train  the  Religious  in  the  virtues  of                humility,  obedience,  and  subjection;  on  the other hand,  she                will  intimately  repute  herself  as  the  servant  of  the  others,                doing everything for them in humility and mortification, giving                the  best  things  to  the  sisters,  but  keeping  the  worst  for                herself. The mother superior","will be careful to always set good example, knowing that this                is  her  chief  duty,  while  her  setting  of  bad  example  -  Jesus                forbid! - makes the souls turn aside from the right way of their                vocation  and  herself  guilty  before  God.  Specifically,  the                mother  superior  will  edify  the  subjects  through  her  exact                observance of the rules, through meekness in transacting the                institute's  business,  patience  in  suffering  opposition,  perfect                obedience to the major superiors, silence, prayer, practice of                virtues, and mortification. In short, the mother superior must                be more virtuous than the sisters. She will love her subjects                as  tenderly  and  strongly  as  her  own  daughters,  regarding                them with indulgence in their faults, and providing them with                everything  they  need.  Besides,  she  will  comfort  and  teach                them  with  love.  When  they  happen  to  be  at  fault,  she  will                correct them by penances that are apt to their amendment. At                last, she will recommend them to God, the most holy Virgin                Mary,  and  the  glorious  Patriarch  St.  Joseph  for  their                perseverance and sanctification (R.L.P.).                                                                            363                          4. BEING GOD'S REPRESENTATIVES                      Each  Rogationist  superior  will  consider  in  the  light  of                faith  that  he represents  the divine  superiors.  Fully  aware  of                this  truth,  he  will  humbly  consider  it  in  his  daily  prayer  and                colloquies with our Lord.                      By  considering  the  obligation  and  the  duties  that  the                office requires of him, the superior will humble himself before                God;  every  day  and  in  each  circumstance,  he  will  implore                divine help in the name of Jesus and enlightenment from our                Lady of Good Counsel.                      He will consider himself the servant of all, directing to the                Lord his actions, corrections, exhortations, and everything he                does to improve his beloved children in","Jesus  Christ  spiritually  or  temporally.  In  fact,  whatever  he                does in the name of the Lord and the most holy Virgin is a                service  to  the  people  who  depend  on  him  in  the  house  of                God. He will be comforted by the example of our Lord Jesus                Christ, who said: « Anyone who wants to be great among you                must  be  your  servant,  and  anyone  who  wants  to  be  first                among you must be your slave, just as the Son of Man came                not to be served but to serve » (Mt. 20, 27-28).                      The  superior  must  combine  the  notion  of  service  with                superiority  so  prudently  as  to  make  the  subjects  pay                subjection, obedience, respect, trust, and holy love.                      He  will  demand  everything  through  love,  trust,  and                reverential fear. But he will be unable to inspire such things,                unless he is a model of religious virtues, perfect observance,                spirit  of  sacrifice,  love,  and  paternal  charity.  May  each                superior  meditate  on  this  article,  because  the  success  or                failure proceeding from his direction depends on it (R.S.).                      Be humble, meek, prudent, fervent, recollected in Jesus,   364                observant  and  diligent  in  correcting  mildly  and  strongly.  Be                the last, but demand obedience and observance (D.S.S.).                      Prudence must be one of the superior's chief virtues; it                regulates the others and consists in understanding well and in                being  aware  of  everything,  either  spiritual  or  temporal.  It                prevents the members of the community from rushing, from                going  to  extremes,  leading  them  to  take  the  happy  mean.                Prudence dissimulates, is forbearing, patient cautious, wise,                vigilant, experienced, and always watchful.                      However,  the  superior  must  distinguish  between  holy                and  profane  prudence.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  we  find  a                prudence coming from the Lord's spirit and a false prudence                coming from the world's. The former acts for God's","glory  and  for  the  good  of  the  souls,  controls  itself,  dis-                simulates,  and  counsels.  Human prudence  instead,  acts  for                human aims and earthly interests. It puts aside God and the                good  of  the  souls  for  human  respect  and  personal                attachment.  The  superior  will  detest  human  prudence  as  a                pestilence  and  shall  not  seek,  think  of,  or  dissimulate  far                human respect, personal regard and liking. It does not mean,                however, that we have to pay no special courtesy toward the                people of high rank, because prudence is not a rough virtue                and  doing  otherwise  would  be  imprudence.  The  prudent                superior  will  never  come  to  terms  with  his  conscience  for                anyone  and  for  whatever  reason,  and  in  dubious  cases  will                resort to prayer and advice. To spare the community serious                damages coming from imprudence, the superior will pray for                prudence  every  day  to  the  adorable  Lard  Jesus  Christ,  the                Holy  Spirit,  and  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  who  is  called                Virgin most prudent. He will often read the wisdom books to                know  how  the  Holy  Spirit  praises  the  virtue  of  prudence                (R.S.).                      Meek, benign zeal and charity's gifts, which are neces-  365                sary to the people in power, do not prevent him from being                unshakable  when  conscience,  rules,  and  prudence  require                so.  In  such  a  case,  after  praying,  considering  things  before                God,  and  taking  advice,  the  superior  will  be  impregnable,                unless circumstances change substantially and  sin does not                take  place.  Meanwhile,  he  will  pray  that  his  consistency  be                well accepted by those who are concerned with it (R.S.).                                            NOTES                     (1)  Our padre said this in 1910. The 1918 Canon Law established                that only the priests may be superiors in the priestly orders.","366","CHAPTER XX                          LITURGY OF THE HOURS, HOLY MASS,                                   AND COMMUNION                     Until  now,  as  a  priest  I  felt  myself  obliged  to  pay                particular  attention  and  devotion,  as  well  as  to  be                recollected in the recitation of the holy office and in the                celebration  of  the  divine  mysteries.  From  now  on,  as  a                congregant  of  an  institute  that  specifically  aims  at                increasing the Catholic priesthood, I promise with God's                help  to  double  my  attention,  devotion,  fervor,  and                recollection  in  the  recitation  of  the  canonical  hours,  in                the celebration of the holy mass, and the sacred rites.                     I will pace the recitation of the prayers with contrite                heart,  taking  delight  in  the  loftiness  of  the  divine                expressions,  in  the  prayers,  and  the  readings.  I  will  do                my best not to delay any canonical hour to a later time.                While reciting the prayers, my intention will be to honor                the  saint  of  the  day,  to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy   367                Church,  to  obtain  divine  mercies  on  our  communities                and the souls In purgatory as well as to convert sinners                and  to  foster  the  interests  of  the  most  holy  Heart  of                Jesus. When the breviary is becoming worn I will ask the                superior for a new one. (1)                     As to the mass, which this institute holds in special                esteem, I will consider it as the most sublime mystery, it                really is. Because I am unworthy and want to be always                aware  of  my  unworthiness  of  ascending  to  the  altar,  I                mean  to  spend  all  my  life  in  a  continuous  preparation                and  thanksgiving  for  the  celebration of the  tremendous                sacrifice  and  for  the  holy  Eucharistic  Communion.  To                prepare myself, before the mass I will kneel and pray for                some  minutes  according  to  our  constitutions,  avoiding                any talk or distraction. While celebrating, I will pace the                pronunciation  of  the  words,  will  be  recollected  In  the                divine  presence  as  best  I  can,  and  will  exactly  observe                the rubrics without looking at the people.","To avoid making mistakes or leaving out some part or changing                things  with  each  other,  I  will  prepare  everything  before  the                celebration, following the ordo. Were I at even Involuntary fault.                I will charge myself with that, asking the superior for a penance.                Mindful of the well proceeding of the mass, I will admonish the                altar boy, even severely if it is necessary, when he rushes the                words or is distracted.                    After the celebration I will make a thanksgiving of at least                20  minutes  in  the  church  or  in  the  sacristy.  Sometimes,                however, I will be available for charity or the works of ministry,                never  accepting  coffee  or  anything  else  before  ending  the                thanksgiving.  When  people  offer  something,  I  will  refuse  by                sincerely saying for public edification: « We take nothing before                the mass thanksgiving. » I will make part of the thanksgiving by                reflection, the remainder either by reflection or by prayer or by                recitation of the canonical hours.                    While  giving  thanks  for  the  mass,  I  will  be  Intimately                recollected in God's divine presence making acts of adoration,                offering, contrition, and love In order to win graces for myself,                the  Institutes,  the  Church,  and  all  as  well  as  to  win  from  the                most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  many  saints  to  the  Church,  to  the                social classes, and to the clergy. Helped by God, I will celebrate   368                the mass every day, doing my best to do so even when I travel.                If health or travel reason prevents me from celebrating, I will be                calm and humble before the Lord, conforming to the divine will                in  peace  and  receiving  Holy  Communion  if  I  am  able  without                great prejudice.                    I  leave  the  special  intention  of  the  holy  mass  to  my                superiors,  who  may  dispose  of  it  as  they  want,  unless  I  am                under  obligation  of  conscience  to  fulfill  engagements                contracted  previous  to  my  entrance  in  the  institute.  (2)  When                the special intention is at the superior's disposal, I will put my                own intentions in the general fruit of the mass also under the                special  intention,  but  under  condition  because  the  probable,                common opinion is that the mass' special fruit is infinite, and                therefore  It  may  meet  all  the intentions.  My  intentions  are  the                ones mentioned above on the recitation of the canonical hours.                    Since  this  institute's  priests  apply  the  priceless  special                fruit  of  the  masses  for  the  institute's  spiritual  and  temporal                needs or for the souls in purgatory, I will not seek offerings","for masses, on the contrary I will renounce them. When                convenience obliges  me  to  receive  such offerings I  will                hand them over to the superior, specifying the names of                the donors, their Intentions, and everything else. (3)                      I will be greatly concerned with the celebration of the                liturgies, only performing the office that holy obedience                assigns to me, but avoiding a better office to satisfy my                pride  because  it  would  be  like  profaning  holy  things.  I                will  also  study  the  rubrics  of  any  religious  service,  as                much as I can.                                        1. HOLY MASS                      Each  community  of  sisters  will  attend  the  daily  cel-                ebration of mass. If daily mass is not available in a place, the                sisters will open no house there.                     The Daughters of Divine Zeal must hold the sacrifice of   369                the mass in the greatest esteem. They should consider it as                the  bloodless  repetition  of  Calvary's  sacrifice,  holding  that                one mass is enough to redeem millions of worlds owing to its                infinite value.                     To win spiritual and temporal graces for God's glory, for                the good of the holy Church, the whole world, and their own                sanctification  the  sisters  will  attend  the  mass  with  faith  and                hope.                      Through  their  faith,  the  sisters  will  see  during  the                celebration  of  the  holy  mass  immense  rivers  of  graces  and                blessings coming out of it and expanding all over the Church                and the world. They will see Jesus as victim and priest who                repeats  the  mysteries  of  his  life  from  the  time  of  his                incarnation up to his death, resurrection, and ascension. They                will  see  Jesus  who  fulfills  the  aims  of the  sacrifice  such  as                adoration,  propitiation,  thanksgiving,  and  prayer.  During  the                celebration  of  the  holy  mass  Jesus  pays  to  the  most  holy                Trinity the homage of all creatures,","adores the divine attributes on our behalf, and offers himself                to the most holy Trinity as victim of infinite satisfaction for the                graces the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit grant. Being                the powerful mediator, he implores graces and mercies.                      We must contemplate this view of faith during the holy                mass, joining Jesus Christ in his adoration, satisfaction, and                thanksgiving  for  any  grace  we  receive,  and  asking                innumerable graces for us and for all.                      Since  the  whole  Church  (militant,  purifying,  and                triumphant) draws advantage from the mass, we have to offer                it  in  union  with  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  for  the  Church                triumphant,  for  the  heavenly  beings'  honor,  glory,  and                thanksgiving;  for  the  Church  militant,  so  that  it  may  flourish                with holiness, that sinners may become converts, that infidels                may enter the Church, and that ministers of mystical harvest                along with any good work super abound. We should offer the                holy mass with feelings of mercy and charity for the Church                purifying, for the souls in purgatory so that the prayers may                super  abound,  the  Most  Precious  Blood  of  our  Lord  Jesus   370                Christ may overflow, purify the purgatory's prison, and lift to                heaven the souls who are longing for it.                      Careful  attention  must  be  paid  to  our  offerings  of  the                mass for so many intentions as well as to the five Gregorian                masses we offer during the year for the liberation of all souls                from purgatory. Such masses will be never left out.                      Please be united with the adorable Heart of Jesus during                the  mass  and  have  great  faith,  great  hope,  great  charity  to                win innumerable graces for yourselves, the pious institute, the                holy Church, souls, and the whole world.","Special attention must be paid to the persons who offer                the mass. These people are: our Lord, the celebrant priest,                and  the  faithful attending  the mass  with  faith  and  love.  The                sacred  authors  say  that  those  who  do  not  receive  grace                during the mass owing to negligence, lack of faith or devotion                will never receive any (S.D.D.Z.).                      While  attending  the  great  sacrifice  of  the  mass,  the                novices  will  imagine  themselves  together  with  Our  Lady  in                sorrow on Calvary at the foot of the most holy cross. That is                the time to offer satisfaction to the Most High for their faults,                to adore the divine majesty, to thank him for the, graces they                have  received,  and  to  humbly  petition  the  graces  of                sanctification  and  perseverance  for  themselves  and  for  all                (From Oria Novices' Directory).                      The congregants will hold the sacrifice of the mass in the                greatest  esteem.  (4)  Holy  mass  is  a  main  means  to  win                mercies  and  graces  from  God  as  well  as  to  perform  one's                own duty of adoration and thanksgiving to God. The priests                will strive to celebrate mass every day. Even while traveling,   371                they  will  do  their  best  and  manage  things  in  order  to  say                mass. The Rogationists of Jesus' Heart are bound in duty to                prepare  themselves  for  the  mass  celebration  through  a                remote  and  immediate  preparation  as  well  as  to  do  an                after-mass-thanksgiving  of  at  least  15  minutes.  This  pious                institute's  congregants  will  offer  the  special  fruit  of  the  holy                mass  for  the  order  and  for  its  members,  living  and  dead;                therefore,  they  will  not  seek  offerings  for  the  celebration  of                masses,  but  will  give  others  priests  the  offerings  they  may                have. This way the special fruit of the mass may be applied                every day for the order's spiritual and temporal needs as well                as  for  the  souls  in  purgatory  and  for  the  benefactors.  The                brothers will attend holy mass with recollection and devotion                every day (C.R.).","2. HOLY COMMUNION                      What are the dispositions required of the probationers for                receiving  Holy  Communion?  To  tell  the  truth,  the  young                candidates  to  religious  life  are  the  sons  of  men  with  whom                Jesus in the holy Sacrament delights to be (Prov. 8, 31). The                most holy Eucharist has been called bread of the angels, and                the probationers must be like angels by innocence and purity                of life when they receive the most Holy Communion.                      This  little  community's  probationers  will  make  of  their                whole life both a continuous preparation and thanksgiving for                the  most  Holy  Communion,  because  they  cannot  improve                their  religious  vocation  without  receiving  Communion                frequently. The preparation will be in common and in private                in the spirit of humility and love.                      After  purifying  and  detaching  his  heart  from  the  world                through the observance of the divine law and holy confession,                the  probationer  will  excite  ardent  love  for  Jesus  in  the                Sacrament as well as intimate acknowledgement of his own   372                misery and unworthiness before receiving Holy Communion.                      What  is  love  all  about  but  longing  to  possess  the                beloved?  This  little  community's  probationers  will  prepare                themselves  to  receive  Holy  Communion  by  exciting  in                themselves  such  a  longing  to  possess  the  infinite  treasure.                Jesus in the Eucharist is bread satiating the famishing, but he                leaves  fasting  the  unhappy  souls  that  are  not  hungry  and                thirsty for him.                      After receiving the Eucharist, the probationers will bend                profoundly,  then  will  go  to  their  place  with  eyes  down  cast                and  their  arms  folded.  Kneeling  upright  and  recollected  as                best they can in the presence of God, they will  meditate on                the living Gad dwelling within them,","they will adore him in deep silence, will offer themselves as a                holocaust,  and  pour  forth  their  thanksgiving  along  with                expressions of love.                      The time after Communion is extremely precious. It is an                opportunity  to  win  graces  for  ourselves  and  others.  The                probationers will profit by it. With humility and trust they will                implore from the supreme goodness in the Sacrament many                graces for their sanctification, the holy Church, the salvation                of  souls,  this  institute,  this  community,  and  the  most  holy                Heart of Jesus' interests. Both in the feasts and in summer                time the probationers will prolong their thanksgiving (P.R.P.).                      The  aspirants  are  free  to  receive  Holy  Communion  on                the  days  suggested  by  their  confessor.  They  must  be                convinced that no other means is more efficacious than daily                Communion  to  improve  their  vocation  and  sanctification,                provided  they  receive  it  with  pure  conscience,  due                preparation,  and  thanksgiving.  On  these  conditions,  daily                Communion is an always burning fire that lightens the flame   373                of divine love.                      The aspirant must consider that if he is so fortunate as to                become a priest, he will receive Holy Communion every day                in the celebration of the divine mass. Why then shouldn't he                start now .this union of love with Jesus, supreme goodness?                Of whom is the aspirant depriving himself the day he does not                receive  Holy  Communion?  If  we  considered  the  infinite                treasure,  the  celestial  lover  we  receive  in  the  Communion,                how could we give him up even once? O candidates for the                Evangelical Rogation, please approach the Eucharistic table                every  day.  Feed  yourselves  with  the  bread  of  the  angels,                unite  yourselves  to  Jesus,  and  you  will  be  holy,  good                evangelical workers of his Church!                      It goes without saying that we should be recollected,","modest,  and  thankful  while  receiving  Holy  Communion.  But                here we only point out that thanksgiving will last at least 15                minutes,  and  will  start  after  the  prayer:  «  Here  I  am,  my                beloved goad Jesus », etc. At the noon prayer the aspirant                will make an additional brief thanksgiving, but during the day                he will never forget the priceless gift he has received, being                always united in love with Jesus (R.A.)!                  a) Dispositions                      I call the Daughters of Divine Zeal's full attention to this                most  important  topic,  because  their  sanctification  and                salvation as well as their institute's improvement and firmness                mainly depend on it.                      Through  living  faith  and  spiritual  intelligence  the                Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  consider  and  understand  the                great mystery of our Lord Jesus Christ, who drawn by excess                of  divine  love  becomes  .bread  in  order  to  feed  us  with   374                himself, becomes one with us in order to transform us in him,                giving us his divine life.                      They will understand that the Eucharistic Communion's                effects are strictly connected with the individual dispositions.                They have to consider this tremendous truth. If one is in the                state of mortal sin while receiving Communion, she eats and                drinks  her  condemnation  according  to  the  words  of  the                Apostle  Paul;  she  commits  sacrilege,  and  the  Eucharistic                Communion becomes poison for her.                      To  avoid  at  any  cost  and  sacrifice  an  additional  harm                which  strikes  more  easily  those  who  receive  Holy  Com-                munion  frequently,  we  have  to  consider  such    harm.  It                happens when a religious person approaches the Eucharistic                table  with  certain  imperfections  such  as  arrogance,  pride,                stubborn  attachment  to  her  own  will  and  opinion,  grudge,                dislike for the mother superior and unwillingness","to  respect,  obey,  and  love  her,  and  she  does  not  want  to                acknowledge  nor  to  correct  these  imperfections.  To  these                interior  indispositions  we  also  add  lack  of  simplicity  and                sincerity due to malice, simulation, and falsehood as well as                disobedience,  negligence,  indifference  in  meditation  and                prayer, dissipation, lack of internal and external silence, and                any deliberate, frequent failure.                      How  a  person  may  consecrate  to  the  Lord,  but  full  of                failings,  defects,  and  indispositions,  receive  him  in  the                Eucharist?  What  kind  of  meeting  can  the  sweetest  loving                Jesus, who is fond of the soul, and God, who is full of virtues                and  infinite  holiness,  have  with  the  alienated  person?  How                displeased Jesus will be! In these conditions, what profit will                the  person  derive  from  such  a  meeting?  By  God's  right                sentence  that  person  will  become  more  and  more  blind,                responsible  and  debtor  toward  God,  stubborn,  angry,  and                impatient  as  well.  Thus,  that  person  will  go  losing  spiritual                sensibility,  going  from  indifference  and  dimness  to  more                serious  sins  and  sacrileges,  as  well  as  losing  her  vocation   375                and  being  lost  for  ever,  unless  the  Lord  shakes  her  with  a                stroke  of  his  triumphant  grace  (which  happens  seldom)  or                with a serious tribulation through sickness or the like.                      May each Daughter of Divine Zeal watchfully beware of                approaching the sacred table and receiving Holy Communion                while  having  an  upset  conscience  or  an  arrogant,  obstinate                heart full of even venial sins, because they will lead to mortal                ones!  Each  Daughter  of  Divine  Zeal  will  receive  Holy                Communion without having any sin, after purifying herself in                the sacrament of reconciliation. She will also delete the daily                defects,  which  are  rather  involuntary  owing  to  human                weakness, by pleading guilty, repenting lovingly, and pledging                to  amend.  She  will  approach  the  angels'  table  with  a  pure                heart, deepest","humility, ardent love, and a living faith, seeing Jesus, who is                going to her full of love, through the eyes of the spirit. She will                approach  the  sacred  table  with  loving  trust  and  burning                longing  in  order  to  receive  her  supreme  goodness,  her  life,                her divine lover, her beloved, the breath of her soul. She will                be  hungry  and  thirsty  for  Jesus.  Her  natural  affections,                feelings,  faculties,  and  sensibility  must  be  transformed                through  this  spiritual  intelligence,  this  hunger,  and  thirst  for                Jesus! (5)                  b) Aridity                      Due  to  complete  aridity  and  languidness,  a  person                sometimes  happens  to  be  unable  to  form  even  a  sensible                feeling  or  desire  for  Jesus.  Whatever  it  may  be,  she  must                meet  everything.  As  much  as  possible,  the  intellect  must                know  who  is  going  to  be  received  and  the  dispositions                required for such a reception. The intellect is the will's owner.                In other terms, we are the masters of our will because we can                perform the acts of will through our free will. Despite aridity of   376                feelings and lack of sensible devotion, the person who wants                to receive a profitable Communion is able to produce acts of                love, contrition, humility, living faith, desire, hunger and thirst                for Jesus, and such a disposition is by no means less meri-                torious  for  us  or  less  pleasing  to  God  than  the  acts  of  the                sensible devotion. Repeating every day the acts of pure will in                the preparation for the Communion also deserves from divine                goodness the loving fire of sensible devotion as well as holy,                loving thirst for Jesus. It can be said with the prophet David: «                My soul is thirsting for you, my flesh is longing for you » (Ps.                63, 1-2).                      Till now we have considered the state of aridity in itself;                now,  we  are  going  to  consider  it  in  its  connection  with                ourselves,  specifically  as  an  effect  of  our  sins  as","well as a punishment we deserve. Our lapses and relapses,                insincere  confession  without  humility  and  resolve,  behavior                diverging from religious perfection, disregard and indifference                in prayer, and so many failures and malice are the cause of                our aridity. This is the why Jesus withdraws from us. Aridity                remains even after a person has received Jesus in the Holy                Communion. She needs to examine herself in her innermost,                to  plead  guilty  before  God,  humiliate  herself,  confess,  and                amend her life, striving to observe the rules perfectly and to                achieve the religious virtues.                      Whatever may be the cause of aridity, the Daughter of                Divine  Zeal  will  strive  to  make  acts  of  love,  desire,  humility                and the like when she receives Holy Communion.                      Through  prayer  we  may  win  everything.  O  soul,  if  you                really  want  to  receive  Holy  Communion  with  great  fervor,                feeling, and understanding of the great mystery of Jesus' love                toward you, but you feel arid and unable to anything, pray to                Jesus  who  will  have  mercy,  will  forgive,  and  will  grant  you                love, humility, faith, desire, hunger, and thirst for himself.   377                  c) Remote preparation (6)                      The preparation far the Holy Communion is remote and                immediate.  Remote  preparation  consists  in  a  religious                irreproachable  life.  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  who  receive                Holy Communion frequently, please strive to be acceptable to                the  divine  spouse  Jesus  so  that  he  may  rest  and  find                pleasure  in  your  heart  when  you  receive  him  in  the  holy                Eucharistic  Communion.  You  will  reach  it  by  perfectly                practicing the virtues, aiming at being prepared for the time                you  receive  Jesus  supreme  goodness  in  the  innermost  of                your  soul.  You  will  direct  the  daily  acts  of  virtue,  patience,                work, mortification, prayer, spiritual reading","silence,  and  everything  toward  the  accomplishment  of  this                goal. By doing so you always remember that you will receive                Communion the following day.                      If  during  the  day  you  now  and  then  invite,  desire,  and                sigh for Jesus in the Sacrament through ejaculatory prayers                and spiritual communions, you please Jesus very much and                help  yourself.  What's  next?  Knowing  that  the  following  day                you  will  receive  Jesus,  as  a  faithful  spouse  you  remember                him even in the night, at least spiritually, intending to sigh for                him at each breath, to receive him at each beat of heart while                sleeping. You will put this intention in the night prayer, before                going  to  sleep.  So,  you  will  fall  asleep  thinking  of  the  holy                tabernacle  and  longing  to  receive  Jesus.  By  doing  so,  you                can say: « I am sleeping, but my heart is vigilant. »                      If you happen to awake in the night, before falling asleep                again  think  a  moment,  desire,  crave  for  the  supreme                goodness  in  the  Sacrament,  that  is  looking  and  waiting  to                enter your heart.                                                                          378                     But to crown your remote preparation, you will profit by a                more precious time the following day, when you have Jesus                in your heart. While giving thanks to Jesus after Communion,                you  can  make  the  best  preparation  for  the  following                Communion.  Like  two  people  who  love  each  other  very                tenderly,  after  staying  together  in  loving  conversation  and                expressions of love, before parting they make an appointment                to see each other again as soon as possible. Jesus and you                will do the same in Communion. Jesus will ask you to receive                him  the  following  day,  and  you,  full  of  his  love  In  spite  of                knowing  that  you  are  unworthy  to  accept  such  a  lovely                invitation,  will  ask  him  that  he  himself  admit  you  to  the                Eucharistic  mystical  table  and  prepare  you  to  so  great  a                fortune. You will","also  offer  the  actual  Communion  as  the  best  remote                preparation for tomorrow's Communion.                  d) Immediate preparation                      If  we  are  as  fervent  as  we  are  careful  in  making  our                remote preparation, we will also act likewise in the immediate                one. A person, who has an appointment with the king, thinks                of how to dress, how to behave, which words to say, the court                formality which she must comply with. But, when she is in the                tabby expecting to be introduced to the presence of the king,                then  she  concentrates  her  thoughts.  Having  a  palpitation of                reverential fear, she gathers in her mind everything she has                planned: how to introduce herself, how to revere, how to talk.                      Will  you  be  indifferent  and  thoughtless  when  you  are                about to receive in your heart the divine lover, your adorable                Jesus, your king of love, the sovereign creator of heaven and                earth,  before  whom  the  powers  of  heaven  tremble,  who  is                waiting  and  longing  for  you  with  sweetness,  love,  and   379                gentleness? God forbid! Daughter of Divine Zeal, when you                enter  the  church  to  attend  the  great  sacrifice  of  the  mass,                when you are before the tabernacle you must consider that                Jesus is there waiting for you - he has been waiting for you                for 20 centuries -that his divine Heart is longing to enter your                heart through the Communion you are going to receive. Think                of  him  in  the  tabernacle,  staying  in  that  prison  of  love  as                waiting for you only, yearning that you will free him by taking                him  in  your  heart  enlarged  by  generous  love.  Please  make                your immediate preparation with these loving thoughts.                  e) Thanksgiving (7)                      The Daughters of Divine Zeal are obliged by rule to give                a combination of thanksgiving after the Communion.","Practically, such thanks are going to be prolonged till the next                Communion,  succeeding  each  other  in  the  following  way,                according to our institute's custom and rule:                      1.  We  start  speaking  of  the  immediate  thanksgiving,                which  is  the  most  important,  beneficial,  indispensable,  and                dutiful.                      As soon as the sister has received her divine lover Jesus                supreme  goodness,  she  will  deeply  understand  that  God  of                heaven and earth, the omnipotent Jesus, the lover of souls is                living in her innermost being. Through the eyes of faith she                will see Jesus the way in which her devotion will let her to see                him,  such  as  watching  and  smiling,  seeking  love,  offering                grace, working in her soul to correct and purify her. Through                the ears of the soul she will listen to him who is saying lovely                words, teaching, admonishing sweetly, exhorting to amend as                well as to improve in his love, observance, humility, and elect                virtues.                      What will you do in those fortunate moments, Daughter   380                of Divine Zeal? You will annihilate yourself in the presence of                your beloved, sinking in love. Everything will disappear from                your  mind,  but  Jesus.  Both  church  and  sisters  will  be  as                non-existent, because Jesus will form a temple in your heart,                where the angels and the saints will adore, exalt, and bless                him for the great mercy he granted to you. If devotion allows,                you may see in the shrine of your soul your sweetest Virgin                Mary  as  mother  of  mercy  who  is  hugging,  thanking,  and                praying to beloved Jesus for you.                      What will you do in those fortunate moments? You will                offer, surrender yourself to Jesus, mourn over your sins and                past  life  perhaps  untidy,  weep  loving  tears  for  your  daily                imperfections  and  perhaps  hidden  malice.  You  will  sink  in                thanksgiving and protestations of love, asking","fervently to love him as much as he deserves or as much as                the saints have loved him or as much as the saints and the                angels  love  him  in  heaven.  You  will  pray  to  the  sweetest                mother of mercy to join you to her love for Jesus. Together                with her you will ask Jesus to grant you the virtues necessary                to  please  him  in  full.  Furthermore,  you  will  implore  with  the                greatest  fervor  and  interest  the  zeal  for  his  glory  and  the                salvation of souls as well as an increasing spirit of the prayer                to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church.  You  will  be                recollected  in  yourself  till  the  end  of  the  mass,  unless                obedience, customs, and rules oblige you to say local prayers                together with the sisters.                      What  we  have  said  now  concerns  the  first,  mast                important  thanksgiving  for  the  Communion.  The  sister  who                practices it carefully will be happy, but miserable will be the                one who neglects it! If you have approached the sacred table                with  relaxed,  upset,  unrecollected  conscience,  holding  a                grudge  against  someone,  being  indocile,  proud,  full  of                attachment  and  impatience,  dirty  with  faults,  riotous  at  the   381                admonishments,  unworthy,  and  having  nearly  mortal  sins,                what  expressions  of  love  can  you  have  with  your  beloved                Jesus? He will come displeased to you, and you will become                more  and  more  blind.  Oh,  daughter,  beware  of  such  a                dangerous  state!  Please  be  converted  to  Jesus.  Humiliate                yourself,  pray,  beg  forgiveness  for  your  bad  examples.                Confess with all contrition, then go to your mother superior,                hear  her  admonitions  and  exhortations,  and  at  last  receive                Communion!  How  pleased  Jesus  will  be!  How  he  will                embrace you! And you will be faithful to him!                      2. Let us talk of the second thanksgiving. It will be made                soon after the mass and the prayer in common to the most                holy crucifix to win the plenary indulgence","for purgatory's souls. This prayer will be never neglected.                      You will always make the first thanksgiving mentally, but                the second one may be done mentally or by reading a booklet                or by both in perfect silence, lasting about 15 minutes. In the                solemnities  it  lasts  longer.  You  will  repeat  the  acts  of  love,                humility,  repentance,  offering,  and  prayer  according  to  the                transport of your devotion.                      3.  The  sisters  will  make  the  third  thanksgiving  in                common. A reader will read it, and the others will follow it by                mind, recollected and contrite. Usually they will use the one                which  begins  with:  «  Exalt  my  heart  », etc.,  but  the  mother                superior  may  sometimes  replace  it  with  others  that  are                expressive and moving.                      4.  The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  make  the  fourth                thanksgiving,  which  must  be  habitual  during  the  day,  by                offering  their  actions,  the  religious  practices,  the  work,                suffering and mortification to the adorable Heart of Jesus as a                continuous  thanksgiving  for  the  immense  grace  of  having   382                received Jesus along with graces and mercies in their heart.                Through  this  intention,  each  sister  will  make  the  fourth                thanksgiving virtually and fruitfully, even  though she may be                unaware of it during the day.                      Who knows haw much Jesus is pleased and how many                graces he gives to the sister who during the day renews over                and  over  again  the  intention  of  a  continuous  thanksgiving!                Jesus  will  be  always  present,  acting  in  her  heart  with  his                grace  and  love.  But  if  the  sister  cannot  reach  so  much                because  of  human  weakness,  Jesus  will  be  somehow                pleased by her good intention and effort.                      5.  A  fifth  thanksgiving  will  be  announced  after  the                evening  prayers.  Recollected,  each  one  will  thank  the                beloved Jesus fervently for the Communion of that day,","will  repent  for  having  thanked  Jesus  unworthily,  and  will                remind herself of the following day's Communion.                 f) Most important consideration                      In the most holy name of Jesus I urge the present and                future  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  to  consider  that  the                improvement in the Lord of their humble institute along with                its  aims  depends  on  receiving  frequently  the  Eucharistic                Communion  with  the  dispositions,  preparations,  and                thanksgivings we have expounded above.                      The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  must  be  convinced  that                union  of  love  with  Jesus  in  the  Communion  gives  life,                existence,  growth,  fecundity,  and  firmness  to  a  religious                institute.  Mutual  union  with  Jesus  founds  the  institute  on  a                firm rock, which hellish powers are unable to throw down nor                to  impair  its  beneficial  results  in  the  holy  Church.  A                community which joins itself to the celestial spouse through                the  Eucharistic  bonds  of  holy  love  delights  the  divine  Heart                that  will  pledge  his  power  and  benevolence  to  protect  and   383                improve  this  community  through  divine,  spiritual,  and                temporal providence.                      On the contrary, when a community slackens the remote                and  the  immediate  preparation  for  the  frequent  Holy                Communion as well as the adequate thanksgiving, quite the                reverse will happen. Jesus is displeased by the indifference                of the consecrated people who receive him every day while                their hearts are attached to their own ego, while they are full                of  selfishness,  perhaps  dirty  with  serious  faults,  envy,  and                grudges. In such a case what are the consequences we have                to face? God withdraws his mercies and reduces his graces,                and yet he arouses remorses, impulses, and opportunities for                conversion.  The  soul  that  mixes  sins  with  Communions                becomes  insensible  quickly;  hence  lukewarmness  grows,                transgressions","multiply,  disease  expands  making  the  whole  community,  or                most of it, swerve from the divine spouse. On the other hand,                the  divine  spouse  too,  withdraws  from  the  community.  The                observance of the vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity                are  relaxed;  both  spiritual  and  material  buildings  collapse;                prosperity and providence diminish owing to the lack of divine                blessings.  It  is  not  a  surprise  if  even  daily  bread  fails,                because the bread of eternal life is being trampled on.                      I heartily recommend that the mother superiors be most                watchful,  that  the  sisters  receive  Holy  Communion  with  the                dispositions,  devotion,  and  recollection  we  have  described                above, and make the thanksgivings as well.                 g) Signs of slackening                      The  mother  superiors  have  to  pay  attention  to  the                external signs which reveal the soul's slackening in the good                disposition  for  receiving  the  Eucharistic  Communion.  They                are: becoming lax in the remote preparation, such as lack of                obedience,  of  silence,  and  of  mutual  charity  as  well  as   384                attachment to one's own will and opinion, etc. A close sign is                the  manifest  indifference  in  approaching  the  sacred  table,                even  though  the  people  may  happen  to  observe  external                behavior for human respect, concealing this way the internal                indisposition.  Slackening  is  both  cause  and  effect  of  the                Communions  received  without  good  disposition.  Especially                the  person  who  receives  Communion  after  doing  wrong  by                consent  and  deliberation  will  easily  lapse  into  anger  or                impatience with her sisters. She has lost meekness.                      The mother superior will ward off so great a disaster by                calling  the  sister  to  order  quickly  and  gently,  charitably  and                firmly, by making her consider the risk of losing her vocation                and becoming lost as well! In such a case, a","good  retreat  is  a  good  remedy.  The  mother  superior  must                keep in mind that a sister who does not amend in time, may                be  contagious.  The  souls'  enemy  may  cause  the  same                situation  to  other  Religious,  and  disaster  will  be  complete                (S.D.D.Z.).                                            NOTES                      (1)  « Each priest will say the canonical hours with great devotion,                not by routine. Recollected and contrite in the divine presence, he will                meditate  on  the  Holy  Spirit's  and  the  Church's divine  words, praying                for the Christian people* (C.R.).                     (2)  Remember  that  our  padre  was  writing   to   Religious   who                entered the order when they were already priests.                     (3)  Obviously,   this   limitation   was   valid   for   that   time.   The                priests were only three and our padre  had  at  heart their  offering the                holy mass for the institute's particular intentions.                     (4)  For the new priests:   «What does  it  mean  celebrating  the                mass  the  first  time?   It  signifies  that  a   most  holy  aim   has  been                reached  as well  as  that  a   most  sublime,  divine   action   has   been                accomplished  on earth!  Each  person,  however,   has a  different  un-  385                derstanding.  The candidate  who  aspires    to    the    priesthood with    no                pure  intention and  recollection,  but who was somehow forced and had                an   imperfect   preparation,   lacks   this   alive   feeling.   On   the                contrary, the one called kike Aaron to the most high ministry, having a                heart  full  of  ardent  love,  innocence,  and  virtue,  as  well  as  a  mind                enlightened  with  the  science  of  prayer  and  with    knowledge  of  the                ecclesiastical  disciplines,  this  candidate  desires  to  feel  the  innermost                relationship with God <in the celebration of his first mass, and longs to                continue the redemptive action in the world as though he were to be a                new Christ on earth » (For Mons. D'Arrigo's golden priestly jubilee, Sept.                21, 1922)!                     (5)    Through  the  decree  «Sacred  Synod  of  Trent*  Pius  X                established the conditions to receive frequent or daily Communion. The                state  of  grace  and  pure  intention  are  the  conditions.  Pure  intention  «                consists in aiming at pleasing God by receiving Communion, joining Him                more","fervently  In  charity  and  profiting  by  that  divine  medicine  against                one's own defects and imperfections.» In a preparation prayer on June                28,  1922,  our  padre  gives  prominence  to  the  pure  intention,  which  is                indispensable  for  daily  Holy  Communion.  He  writes:  «I  declare  that  I                receive  this Holy  Communion  to  please you,  because I know you  like                coming into my heart, not because other people do it nor by routine. I am                going to receive this Holy Communion to correct my defects along with                my bad inclinations, because you, in the Holy Sacrament, are remedy                and health for faulty souls. Since I am frail, I mean to receive you as the                divine  strength  of  my  soul.  Being  united  with  you,  may  I  get                enlightenment,  strength,  and  help  in  order  to  reach  holy  virtues.  I  am                going  to  receive  this  Holy  Communion  to  become  humble,  obedient,                meek, sincere, and fervent. Since I do not know how to love you, I mean                to  receive  this  Holy  Communion  in  order  that  your  Eucharistic  Heart,                which in the most Holy Sacrament is like the fire of love burning the soul,                share your fire of love with me. My beloved Jesus, please come in my                heart. I expect, sigh, long for you, please do not be late. Even though I                am so fortunate as to receive Holy Communion every day, still I receive                today's  Communion  with  as  much  fervor  and  love  as  it  were  my  first                Communion or the last one or the viaticum, and then I should present                myself before your tribunal for judgment.»                    (6)  We call the attention on our padre's  teaching. He desires that                the  assiduous  care  for  our  individual  sanctification  be  the  remote                preparation  for  the  most  Holy  Communion  according  to  the  Church's   386                teaching.  This  page  seems  an  advanced  comment  on  the  following                declarations  and  exhortations  of   Pius  XII.   The  pope   teaches  that                <  an  abundant    rain  of  grace  will  come  from  mass  and    Holy  Com-                munion,  if  we  love  the  everlasting    goods  instead    of  the    perishable                ones  as  well  as  if  we  bridle  our  mortal  body  with  voluntary  mor-                titifications    by   imposing   what   is   unpleasant   and    hard   to   it»                (Mystical Body); furthermore, the pope states that the person willing to                share the mysteries of Jesus has to  root out from  the senses wordiy                allurements      and    vices...   thus,      the    ascetic    effort    aiming      at                purifying  the  spirit   urges  and   disposes  the   faithful's  energies  to                share   in  the  altar's  sacrifice  with   better  dispositions  and   better                results...   Hence,   they   come   out   more   enlivened   and   disposed                to prayer  and   Christian   mortification»   (God's   Mediator).                    (7)  Be not surprised by our padres's insistence on the thanksgiving                for the  most  Holy Communion. Among  the  dispositons  required   in                order   to   receive   more   abundant   fruits   from   the   most Holy                Communion, St. Pius X pointed out «a diligent thanksgiving. > Confining                ourselves  to  some  quotations  from   God's   Mediator,  we report that                Pius  XII  wants  us  after  communion  to  <  linger  in  intimacy","with  the  divine  Savior...  keeping  ourselves  so  close  to  Christ  as  to                plunge  in  his  most  holy  soul...  in  a  sweetest,  beneficial  talk...  Liturgy                requires  people  receiving  Holy  Communion  to  thank  God  properly...                because  thanksgiving  is  absolutely  necessary  to enjoy  the Eucharist's                supernatural treasures, more abundantly.»                    Both the saints and the masters of spirit insist so strongly on this                point  that  St.  Vincent  of  Paul  sums  up  their  mind  in  this  saying:                «Whoever  makes  the  thanksgiving  well,  does  everything  well.»  In  his                Inner  Life  Fr.  Dagnino  points  out  the  great  importance  of  a  most                accurate, prolonged thanksgiving, which he wants to be at least of a half                an hour; Fr. Colosio, editor of the magazine Asceticism and Mystics, in                his  preface  to  this  work  shares  completely  the  author's  idea  even  as                reaction to  «some strange  pseudo-liturgical  well known theories  which                minimize  the  value  of  this  natural  completion,  of  this  obvious,  morally                indispensable  cooperation  aiming  at  psychologically  rooting  the                Eucharistic graces in the souls.»                                                                                   387","388","CHAPTER XXI                                  THE DIVINE COMMAND                     I  declare  that  I  deeply  understand  our  Lord  Jesus                Christ's divine words which form this humble Institute's                distinctive  character.  The  words  that  our  Lord  Jesus                Christ said more than once when he saw the crowds in                Judea abandoned like flock without a shepherd: « There                is a large harvest, but few workers to gather it in. Pray to                the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to                gather  in  his  harvest.  »  I  will  consider  these  words  as                addressed  to  this  plows  institute's  congregants  In  a                particular  way  and  as  though  the  congregants  had                received them from Jesus Christ's adorable lips. In this                spirit,  I  consider  myself  fortunate,  because  I  have  been                called  to  cultivate  this  divine  word,  to  which  I  mean  to                commit my life. I will often consider the appropriateness                of this mission and the vow of obedience to this divine                command,  to  which  the  institute's  members  are                committed.                                                389                     The Church is the great harvest of the people all over                the  world  of  any  class  and  condition.  I  will  always                consider that most of the harvest In the infidels' lands, in                the countries separated from the Catholic Church, in so                many Catholic cities and countryside perishes for lack of                workers  I  will  feel  my  heart  broken  by  so  great  a  ruin                which  knocks  down  the  tender  harvest  of  the  new                generations,  and  will  share  in  the  most  holy  Heart  of                Jesus'  intimate  pains  for  such  a  great,  continuous,                secular  ruin.  Remembering  the  divine  words:  «  Pray,                therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the harvest  that  he  will  send                out workers to gather in his harvest », I will hold that no                remedy is more efficacious than this one commanded by                our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  to  save  the  people,  the  nations,                society,  the  Church,  especially  children  and  youth  as                well as to evangelize the poor and to get all spiritual and                temporal goods for humankind. Such a command urges                us to entreat the","most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  his  most  holy  mother,  the                angels  and  the  saints  so  that  the  Holy  Spirit  raise                powerful  vocations,  most  elect  souls,  zealous  and                charitable  priests  for  the  salvation  of  souls,  and  God,                himself,  create  the  most  elect  apostles  and  very  holy                souls in all human classes. I will hold that the efforts of                the holy Church's prelates and of the people responsible                for forming holy priests is of no avail, unless God himself                forms  the  priests.  This  does  not  happen,  unless  we                resort  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  sovereign  remedy,                obeying  faithfully,  zealously,  and  enthusiastically  the                divine  command:  «  Pray,  therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the                harvest  that  he  will  send  out  workers  to  gather  in  his                harvest ».                     I will dedicate my life and my intentions to the prayer                of the « Evangelical Rogation of the most holy Heart of                Jesus, »  paying careful attention and zeal to it. Following                our constitutions I will care that our Lord Jesus Christ's                command, so far underestimated, be known and obeyed                everywhere.  Specifically,  I  will  strive  so  that  the  two                clergies, the holy Church's prelates, the pious souls, the   390                virgins consecrated to Jesus, the seminarians, the poor,                and  the  children  pray  to  God  that  he  will  send  out                Innumerable perfect workers in the priesthood and laity                for the sanctification and salvation of all the peoples. To                make this «rogation» universal, with the Lord's help I will                be ready to meet any sacrifice, even to give up my life.                                1. CARVING IT IN THE HEART                      The  Little  Poor  of  Jesus'  Heart  must  keep  the  divine                Savior's  word  in  her  heart,  carve  it  there,  and  feel  his                supreme  interest  deeply. Like  the  loving  mystical  dove,  she                will wail in the presence of God to win from divine mercy holy                vocations to the priesthood and will pray for the sanctification                of  the  priests. To  keep  this prayer  alive  and  to  qualify their                mission, the Little Poor of Jesus' Heart will put on their chest                a badge in the shape of Jesus' Heart with the words: Pray,                therefore, etc. This motto","forms their humble institute's emblem and specifies the zeal                to which they are committed for God's glory and the salvation                of souls (C.P.).                      Beginning  with  the  double  proclamation  of  the  divine                superiors,  the  Rogationist  of  Jesus'  Heart  wilt  love  and                respect more his institute's sacred emblem: Pray, therefore,                etc. He will imagine the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, the divine                superior  in  the  tabernacle,  who  afflicted  for  lack  of  priests                shows St. Luke and St. Matthew's verses (Lk. X, 2 - Mt. IX,                37)  as  well  as  the  souls  abandoned  like  a  flock  without  a                shepherd. He invites him to look at the harvest of souls, the                people, and the works that are getting lost for lack of workers,                and says: « Here is the rule that I and my most holy mother,                your  sweet,  benign,  lowing  superiors  give  you.  Do  not  get                tired of praying in my name to the owner of the harvest (me,                the  Father,  and  my  most  holy  mother)  to  quickly  send  out                numerous, holy workers to the mystical harvest. You yourself                strive to become a good worker for my glory and the salvation                of souls in whatever mission I will appoint you (From the Little   391                Rules of the Two Proclamations).                      While praying for holy vocations, the Little Poor of Jesus'                Heart will ask God to help many poor youths who are longing                to  become  priests  and  to  grant  perseverance  to  those  who                are answering God's call.                      Clerics. The seminaries are the fields of our Lord Jesus                Christ's Church, where the mystical plantations are cultivated.                The tender buds  which will feed all the people on earth are                the clerics. Oh, the beautiful hope of the coming harvest! The                luxuriant generation of the mystical harvest's future workers!                The clerics are the most beautiful, the dearest share of Jesus'                Heart!  Beautiful  is  the  plantation  in  bloom,  when  the  fruits                begin springing up. Then it is more beautiful and gentle than","after its harvest. Likewise, the generation of the future priests                smiles  beautifully  at  the  mystical  farmer's  eyes.  With  how                much love, care, and jealousy the divine lover looks at them!                They are the first fruits of his love, the future saviors of, the                souls he redeemed by his Most Precious Blood! The fate of                millions  and  millions  of  souls  is  bound  to  their  success!                Therefore,  this  elect  generation,  this  hope  of  the  most  holy                Heart  of  Jesus  will  be  the  most  cherished,  holy,  and  pure                thought of Jesus Heart's Little Poor (C.P.).                      It  is  necessary  to  bring  into  evidence  the  gratuitous,                undeserved  predestination  of  God  to  form  the  pious                foundation  of  the  two  institutes  that  are  dedicated  to  the                adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  and  are  committed  to  his  divine                command of the Evangelical Rogation. His command keeps                the  secret  of  the  world's  and  of  society's  salvation,  were  it                made an  institution. The  institution  comes  into  existence  by                the vow of obedience to this command, by the rule binding its                members to pray, by the emblem decorating the congregants'                chest  and  by  the  expressive  names  of  the  two  orders:                Rogationists  of  Jesus'  Heart  (from  the  Latin  word  Rogate)   392                and Daughters of Divine Zeal; either order must follow Jesus'                Heart's  divine  zeal,  from  which  the  divine  command  came                forth!                      Both  institutes  are  born  of,  in,  and  from  Rogate.  They                have  almost  received  these  ardent  words  from  the  divine                teacher's adorable lips, feel themselves intimately penetrated                by  the  Rogate,  have  absorbed  it  as  the  hope  of  their                existence  in  Jesus  and  in  his  longing  for  the  Father's  glory                along with the salvation of the souls. These institutes are not                satisfied  by  fulfilling  the  command  among  themselves,  nor                following  only  the  prayer's  command  that  the  Lord  of  the                harvest send out workers, but they also apply two additional                meanings. The point of fact","is that God's word may be applied limitlessly, and the more it                is contemplated, the more it is esteemed.                      What is the first binding meaning? It flows from the word                «  workers.  »  Committed  to  each  word  of  this  mystical                decalogue  (  it  is  made  of  ten  words:  «  Rogate  -  ergo  -                dominum  -  messis  -  ut  -  mittat  -  operarios  -  in  -  messem                -suam »  ), we should feel ashamed to ask God and the most                holy  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary  for  good  workers  to  the                mystical harvest of the souls, if we ourselves were not striving                with all our soul, heart, mind, and body to be good workers                with God's help, our good will, and pure intention. The divine                words asking for workers to the immense harvest of the souls                keep ourselves ready, miserable as we may be, to favor with                God's help any charitable, beneficent work, either spiritual or                temporal, whenever we may apply our efforts to it.                      The  second  meaning  flows  from  the  word  ergo.  If  we                meditate on the small word  « ergo », which means therefore,                the  prayer's  validity  and  efficacy  gain  value.  The  adverb  «                therefore »  summarizes  the  precedent  reasons,  proofs, and   393                reasonableness  as  well  as  the  application  that  the  people                make to the subject.                      To  understand  the  therefore's  importance  when  it  is                related  to  the  prayer's  efficacy  to  win  numerous  and  elect                priests  to  the  holy  Church,  we  report  the  reasons  why  the                divine teacher, thirsty for souls, commanded many times his                prayer  of  his  divine  zealous  Heart  to  the  apostles,  to  the                disciples, and to all the followers.                      This  therefore  binds,  urges,  almost  compels  us  to                answer  directly  the  command  to  win  holy  vocations  of  new                priests, new ministers, a new creation of divine omnipotence                and mercy, new angels of the divine priestly ministry through                insistent,  humble,  and  trustful  prayers.  Desirous  of  nothing                else but divine glory and salvation","of souls, may these ministers share in the divine thirst of our                Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  longed  and  longs  for  the  eternal                salvation of all. May they grow in the most elect virtues and in                the  beneficial  ecclesiastical  science,  which  inclines  them  to                the  perfect  practice  of  the  holy  ministry.  As  new  apostles,                may they hurl themselves in the midst of the souls that Jesus                Christ redeemed with his Most Precious Blood in order to win                them  to  the  virtue,  grace,  and  eternal  life  through                ecclesiastical law, fervor, faith, and charity!                      Oh,  how  happy  are  those  who  understand  the  divine                command:  Pray,  therefore...  (From  various  records  of  our                padre).                                 2. THE GREAT REVELATION                      The evangelists St. Luke and St. Matthew registered our                Lord Jesus Christ's great word.                                                                          394                     St. Matthew says: As he saw the crowds, his heart was                filled  with  pity  for  them,  because  they  were  worried  and                helpless,  like  sheep  without  a  shepherd.  So  he  said  to  his                disciples,  «  There  is  a  large  harvest,  but  few  workers  to                gather it in. Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send                out workers to gather in his harvest » (Mt. 9, 36-38).                      St.  Luke  (10,  2):  he  said  to  them,  «  There  is  a  large                harvest, but few workers to gather it In. Pray to the owner of                the  harvest  that  he  will  send  out  workers  to  gather  in  his                harvest. »                      The meaning of these words in obvious. Harvest means                the people; workers means the priests as well as those who                are in charge with saving the people entrusted to them: the                people  are  many,  but  God's  ministers  few,  therefore  Jesus                said: Pray to the owner of the harvest,","that  is  to  say,  pray  to  God  that  he  will  send  out  numerous                priests to his Church for the salvation of all.                      Rogate  -  it  means  pray  -  implies  both  exhortation  and                command, and each Christian is obliged to obey it; hence all                of us have to pray to reach this goal, because Jesus Christ                wants it.                      These  passages  from  the  holy  Gospel  make  a  great                revelation:                      1. First, they manifest the desire of the most holy Heart                of Jesus, who was to create the true, eternal priesthood on                earth in order to perform the divine cult, to offer forever the                victim  of  infinite  value,  and  to  continue  on  earth  his  divine                ministry of eternal salvation for souls. Thirsty for souls as he                was, Jesus could not help letting burst forth this great word,                this divine command. To quote a biblical phrase we say that                his  zeal  was  devouring  his  divine  Heart  far  his  greatest                interest.                                                                          395                     2.  Second,  through  those  symbolical  words  Jesus                represented  the  holy  Church,  the  whole  world,  and  each                social organization as a harvest which should be cultivated by                good workers to fill the mystical barns with copious craps. If                the harvest is neglected, it perishes miserably.                      3.  Third,  through  these  words  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ                pointed out that his priests are the means of salvation for the                mystical  harvest  of  souls;  no  doubt  that  obedience  to  this                divine command is the secret key that saves the Church and                society. Such a prayer is the holy Church's greatest means to                expand  the  kingdom  of  God and  to  reach  all  goods  in time                and eternity. (1)                      4. Fourth, our Lord wants us to understand that to obtain                this priceless good we have to pray to the owner","of the harvest, who is God, who is himself. He taught us that                his priests do not come by chance, nor are self-formed, nor                are  formed  by  human  effort.  They  come  from  divine  mercy                that creates, begets, and gives them to the world. He teaches                us that we do not get them, unless we pray! Isn't it obvious? It                is God that sends forth the saints on earth. Isn't it a greatest                mercy of his? How can we pretend to have it without asking                for  it?  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  command  is  very  clear:  «                There is a large harvest, but few workers to gather it in. Pray,                therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that he  will  send  out                workers to gather in his harvest. » (2)                      In reference to the holy Catholic Church and society, this                divine  word  refers  to  all  goods  and  salvation  in  time  and                eternity.  And  yet,  for  about  20  centuries  this  great  word,                which is our Lord Jesus Christ's definite, repeated command,                has remained almost buried or quite unknown in the gospel,                in spite of keeping a great secret of salvation for the Church                and  society.  Oh,  God's  inexplicable  mysteries!  Although  it                was  so  clear,  God  kept  it  secret  perhaps to  reveal  it  in  our                times when religion is depopulated, and when the cities and   396                the  peoples  are  lacking  the  greatest  means  of  salvation                (Preface, Precious Adhesions, 1921).                                   3. BUT FEW WORKERS...                      Jesus makes us hear his painful wail: « There is a large                harvest,  but  few  workers  to  gather  it  in.  »  When  our  Lord                Jesus Christ said these words, he was looking through all the                centuries at the cities, the peoples, the regions of the world till                the  end  of  time,  and  lamented  over  the  lack  of  evangelical                workers, which at times is worse than other times.","If we look at our pitiable times, we cannot help sharing in                the adorable Jesus' Heart's pains for the great lack of people                dedicated  to  the  mystical  harvest.  The  Church  is                impoverished, the souls perish, and the desolation foreseen                by  Daniel  is  expanding  under  the  eyes  of  the  shepherds  of                the Church. All of them experience the lack of priests in the                dioceses, cities, and countrysides.                      A  bishop  wrote  to  me  that  42  country  parishes  of  his                diocese have no priest. Other bishops complain too, some of                them  more,  some  less.  What  about  the  people?  My  God,                what  an  abyss  of  misery!  And  yet,  the  regions  lacking                ministers  perhaps  have  innocent  children  who  would  feel                drawn  to  ecclesiastical  vocation,  if  they  were  cultivated  in                piety and the love of God.                      The  lack  of  financial  means  sometimes  prevents  the                parents  from  encouraging  their  children  to  enter  the  ec-                clesiastical status; in this case, the seed of piety instilled by                the Lord fails to grow, because the children are not cultivated,                or are hired for a quick profit, or the families are indifferent. In   397                short, many are the reasons why so many youths remain in                the world to the prejudice of their soul and the souls of others,                while they might have become holy priests.                      Meanwhile,  who  saves  the  new  generations?  Who                breaks the bread of God's word to the children who ask for it,                but do not find any? Who teaches the poor youths so much                betrayed everywhere? « Let the children come to me » (Mc.                10,  14),  said  Jesus  Christ.  But,  who  lets  the  children  go  to                Jesus?  Perhaps  the  philanthropic  societies?  Or  the  civil                colleges? Or the protestants, who as richly hired emissaries                plunged  in  everywhere  after  the  European  war  to  open                kindergartens  -  my  God!  -  and  schools  and  colleges  and                orphanages free of charge","in  order  to  get  hold  of  children  and  dechristianize  them,                teaching  that  Jesus  Christ  founded  no  Church,  or  that  the                Church  is  invisible,  or  that  praying  to  the  most  holy  Mary                offends Jesus Christ, or that using sacred images is against                the commandments, or that the Eucharistic Sacrament is not                Jesus Christ, or that confession has been fabricated by the                priests, etc. etc.? My God, what a ruin for the souls!                      Oh!  How  many  youths  go  astray  in  their  prime  of  life                because no good evangelical worker receives them, showing                the  way  of  piety  through  pious  unions,  associations,  good                readings,  holy  industries,  and  true  zeal.  The  endangered                honesty of common and civil young women perishes, for no                minister  guides  them  to  the  sacraments  through  untiring                preaching, hearing confessions, and teaching. No one helps                or  shelters  the  poorest  among  them  through  resources  of                charity. How many beggars are immersed in crass ignorance                because no  priest  teaches  and relieves  them!  Who blesses                and  legitimates  marriages?  Who  safeguard  the  virgins  who                long  for  the  mystical  wedding,  joining  them  with  the  divine                spouse?  Who  assists  the  dying  when  they  are  on  the   398                threshold  of  eternity?  Oh,  how  many  sick  people  languish,                dying  without  confession,  viaticum,  and  extreme  unction                because no priest is available!                      Impiety,  unbelief,  anarchy  of  any  holy  principle  in  faith                and civilization make their way more and more into the world.                Debauchery, bad press, sects, plots, revolutions, misery, and                desperation are increasing.                      If  we  look  at  the  infidels'  regions,  which  are  the  most                extensive,  our  heart  bleeds  for  the  abandoned  souls  which                are of as much value as ours, are redeemed by the adorable                blood of our Lori Jesus Christ, and","are  willing  to  meet  the  truth.  How  many  thousands  of                not-,baptized  children  are  eaten  by  animals  or  are  thrown                down by wild parents in a river or at the foot of a tree,  still                gasping!  How  many  thousands  of  wild  people  grow                brutalized,  dying  without  knowing  God  and  the  why  of  their                existence.                      All  this  happens  for  lack  of  workers  in  the  mystical                harvest, for the missionaries are not enough for the needs of                the infidel's regions.                      In  short,  today  we  can  repeat  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's                words: There is a large harvest, but few workers!                                    4. PRAY, THEREFORE                      What is the remedy?                      Our Lord pointed to a great, universal remedy by saying:   399                « Pray, THEREFORE, to the owner of the harvest that he will                send  out  workers  to  gather  in  his  harvest.  »  This  supreme,                infallible  remedy  is  tied  to  prayer.  We  called  this  remedy                infallible because our Lord cannot be mistaken. If he pointed                to  prayer  as  to  a  remedy,  it  means  that  the  prayer  will  be                heard, otherwise he would have not recommended it. It is as                though he had said: if you ask me for workers for the souls'                harvest, I will give them. But, it also means: if you do not ask                me for them, you will not have as many good workers as you                need. (3)                      Several  things  Jesus  commanded  in  the  gospel;  ex-                perience  from  centuries  teaches  that  everytime  the  people                followed those divine commands, they reached what God has                promised.  So,  the  Lord  will  bless  the  dioceses  and  the                seminaries that pray for vocations, solving all their problems,                and enabling the world to prepare","itself  for  the  execution  of  the promise  of one  flock  and  one                shepherd. (4)                      Let  us  ask  the  God  of  mercy  and  of  holiness  for                phalanxes of apostles. If we pray, he cannot help giving them,                since he pledged his word. A radical remedy is at stake: let us                apply ourselves to this holy radicalism.                      When  God  punishes  a  people  with  the  greatest  pun-                ishment,  he  deprives  it  of  good  priests.  This  is  the  worst                misfortune  for  a  city.  The  greatest  divine  mercy  is  God's                sending out good workers for the salvation of souls as he did                when he sent on earth his only Son, whose representatives                are the priests.                      If both the prayer to win priests according to God and the                works  to  propagate  this  prayer  were  coming  from  a  simple                inspiration and from the natural consideration of its utility, all                the people should preferably answer such an advertisement                for  its  high  aim.  We  know  instead  that  Jesus  Christ himself                commanded this universal prayer of the highest importance,   400                and we find it remarkable that St. Luke reports Jesus Christ's                divine  exhortation  by  using  the  verb  in  the  imperfect  tense,                which  means  -  used  to  say,  -  pointing  out  how  insistently                Jesus inculcated it.                      We  also  remark  that  since  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ                commanded  us  to  pray  for  good  priests,  the  labor  of  the                bishops along with the seminaries' directors only reaches an                artificial  culture  of  priests,  if  such  a  command  is  neglected.                The Church will have half-priestly vocations for lack of grace,                since  only  the  most  extensive  obedience  to  that  command                through the most extensive, interested prayer to win priests                according  to  God  may  gain  such  a  grace.  Oh!  Only  the                Powerful who is able to rouse descendants to Abraham from                the rocks, can raise such priests (Lk. 3, 8).","5. THE POPES' CONCERN                      Let  us  remember  the  work  of  the  last  popes  who                concerned  themselves  with  this  spirit  of  prayer,  starting                something  as  the  prelude  to  the  worldly  increase  of  obedi-                ence to this divine command.                      Under the pontificate of Pius X, the writer of these pages                who has started three institutions with this divine prayer, gave                an account of them to the head of the holy Church, who once                said: « I want to champion this prayer. »                      Later, through His Eminence Merry del Vail he replied to                the  director  of  these  institutes,  and  expressed  his  pleasure                because so many personalities of the ecclesiastical hierarchy                had  taken  to  heart  this  command  of  Christ,  and  joined  his                prayer to the prayer of so many members, with pleasure. (5)                      When  I  submitted  a  humble  petition  to  His  Holiness                Benedict  XV,  he  joined  the  universal  pious  union  of  the                Evangelical Rogation of Jesus' Heart, and concerned himself   401                with  this  command  by  saying  that  Jesus  gave  it                authoritatively. He praised the institute's aim and on May 10,                1921,  spontaneously  granted  a  plenary  indulgence  to  those                who  would  pray  before  the  Holy  Sacrament  for  an  hour  in                order  to  win  holy  vocations.  Furthermore,  considering  the                great lack of missionaries for the infidels' conversion, all the                popes desire, he published a beautiful prayer to win holy mis-                sionaries  for  the  blooming  harvest  of  the  regions  of  the                infidels,  giving  prominence  to  the  divine  command:  Rogate                Ergo.                      Almost  contemporaneously  and  under  the  auspices  of                His Eminence Card. Vicar, a Pious Union committed to pray                for  the  winning  of  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church  was                formed in Rome.","We cannot help enjoying the appearance of the first ray                of the rising sun of this spirit of prayer or  universal rogation                through the working of two popes. This rising from the high                began  advancing  splendidly  and  shiningly  since  the  early                days of Pius XI's pontificate when the Pious Union of prayer                was presented to him, and he praised this prayer as the work                of the works; which expression is worthy of consideration.                      Inspired word: God spoke through his vicar!                      Praying  for  holy  vocations  is  the  work  par  excellence                because Jesus Christ commands it and because the Catholic                priesthood will bloom in the holy Church by winning holy and                powerful vocations from God. Since the Catholic priesthood is                Jesus  Christ's  priesthood,  his  word  comes  true:  «  As  the                Father sent me, so I send you »... and all good follows, being                the priests the salt and the light of the world. The Church, the                dioceses, and the history of the regions of the infidels show                how  much  good  came  from  the  Catholic  priesthood.  Aren't                the  priests  the  perpetuators  of  the  divine  redemption?  How                many holy priests did we have in all times and how many holy   402                institutions did they found!                      When  the  prayer  commanded  by  Jesus  Christ  to  win                priests to the Church is constituted and organized through an                institution,  it  must  be  called  the  work  of  the  works.  Well                understood,  this  expression  means:  «  a  work  dedicated  to                this  aim  is  the  mother  of  many  good  works,  generator  of                great, holy activities for the greatest glory of God, the greater                salvation of souls, and the amplest fulfillment of the Church's                divine  mission  in  the  world.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  is  the                work that wins the elect of God, bringing about the saints in                the Church. »                      Pius XI arranged a yearly day of prayer in Rome (as well                as in the dioceses all over the world), aiming at","bending the divine clemency to eliminate the lack of priests -                what a great punishment! - by enriching the holy Church with                plenty of holy vocations.                                   6. NECESSARY PRAYER                      The holy Church and the peoples all over the world need                this  prayer  because  God  fixed  beforehand  that  the  priests                guide human beings to the truth and salvation. (6) God also                established  that  even  redemption  is  useless  without  the                priests,  since  they  are  entrusted  with  continuing  it  and                applying its fruits. For that reason Jesus said tee the priests:                « You are the light of the world, you are the salt of the earth                »;  but  there  is  no  light  without  the  lantern  shining  on  the                lamp-stand; there is no way to preserve food from corruption                without the salt keeping it.                      Both! Church and society are in trouble. Jesus Christ's                mystical  bride  cries  for  lack  of  evangelical  workers,  while   403                society's ruin increases!                      Wherever  good  appears,  faith  blooms,  the  souls  find                salvation,  the  youth  grow  faithful,  the  poor  are  relieved,  the                good  works  rise.  Wherever  religion  is  supported,  defended,                and  protected,  error  is  defeated.  Wherever  the  laity  is                Catholic and active, there you find the priest's work. It is the                work of the bishops, of the holy Church's prelates, and of the                clergies that operates all the good you find on earth; but all                people  receive  light  and  splendor  from  the supreme  pontiff,                who is the Church's sun receiving light from God directly. This                great  ecclesiastical  hierarchy  is  made  of  elect  workers  who                are  appointed  by  God  to  the  divine  ministry.  The  world                receives life from its splendor.                      Please imagine for a moment the priesthood dying","out  as  the  sun  dies  at  sunset.  Wouldn't  the  world  stay  in                darkness? Where would you find God's cult, the sacraments,                the  Eucharist,  God's  word,  faith,  and  charity?  All  of  them                would end!                      Now,  please  imagine  the  opposite.  Suppose  that  the                earth  is,  full  of  God's  elect  ministers,  of  numerous,  holy                priests: one for every hundred persons and all of them are as                holy as. the ancient apostles. Wouldn't you think it would be                he  sudden  salvation  and  happiness  of  all  souls,  no  one                excepted?                      Oh,  unfathomable  judgments  of  God!  The  Most  High                conditioned plenty of good workers in the mystical harvest to                the prayer to win them (News and Registration of the Sacred                Allies Supporters).                      Praying  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  is  also  necessary                because the sending out of the workers to the harvest as well                as the abundant gathering are of utility to all people, whose                salvation  we  must  solicit  and  promote  mutually  through   404                prayer.                      Let us acknowledge, therefore, that innumerable goods                for  the  holy  Church  and  the  peoples  may  come  from  the                faithful obedience to this divine command as well as from the                universal spreading of this universal Rogation.                      Like efficacious grace, vocations come from high. If we                neglect  the  command  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  to  pray,                vocations will not come nor will we achieve the effects of so                many  works  and  culture.  In  fact,  we  are  unable  to  infuse                efficacious, fervent vocations; only the Church's unanimous,                fervent prayer is able to do it. If based on prayer, the bishops'                work  in  the  seminaries  may  become  immensely  useful  and                efficacious;  the  same may  occur  in  the  religious  orders.  To                conclude, we insist on saying that the remedy is prayer; by                making no use","of It, we slight it, and we will suffer the consequences from                lack of good vocations.                      How  is  it  that  priests  sometimes  abound,  while  their                priestly  work  is  lacking?  And  yet,  the  work  of  priestly                formation  in  the  Church  is  very  active.  Both  dioceses  and                religious  orders  have  plenty  of  seminaries  for  youths  along                with blooming novitiates. For that reason we make a point of                Providence wanting action and prayer combined to produce                their  effect.  Praying  to  the  Lord  that  he  will  send  out  good                workers to the holy Church without working according to our                duty and possibility to reach such a goal is a vain prayer, it is                like a « noisy gong or a clanging bell » (I Cor. 13, 1). Vice                versa, working for the priestly formation without praying is a                useless work, « wasting its punches » (1 Cor. 9, 26). Aiming                at  forming  priests  without  asking  them  from  the  Lord  is                cultivating  priests  artificially.  True  vocation  comes  from  on                high through prayer (Rules for the Sacred Allies Supporters).                                                                            405                        7. PRIESTHOOD IS FOUNTAIN OF MERITS                      The  spreading  of  this  divine  prayer  brings  about  many                particular graces to souls. Oh! How do they open their mind                to understand the priesthood's importance!                      A  great  benefit  is  the  understanding  of  the  merits  they                may acquire. (7) St. Vincent de Paul thinks that no good work                deserves so much as the formation of one priest for the holy                Church. Whoever forms a priest for the Church shares in the                spiritual maternity oaf the Church and in the good the priest                will  operate  such  as  the  administration  of  the  sacraments,                preaching, and the salvation of souls, profiting spiritually and","temporally because God blesses him in everything. When the                priest celebrates the daily sacrifice of the mass, the person                who formed him (either alive or dead) will share the best of it.                      To cheer ourselves in this spirit of prayer, we should look                at  the  example  of  our  Lord,  the  most  holy  Virgin,  and  the                saints.                      Jesus  Christ  «  did  and  taught  »  (Act.  1,  1).  Before                ordering  his  apostles  and  his  disciples  to  win  evangelical                workers  through  prayer,  he  himself  prayed  for  it.  In  fact,                before  calling  the  holy  apostles  he  prayed  all  night  on  a                mountain (Lk. 6, 12). (8) Where did the Catholic apostolate of                all  times  come  from?  Who  brought  about  the  apostles,  the                confessors, the saints, and the untiring workers of all times?                      « His mother treasured all these things in her heart » (Lk.                2,51). Did Mary keep her divine son's words idle in her heart,                as  the  lazy  servant  did  with  the  money?  Not  at  all.  She                untiringly  did  what  her  son  commanded,  never  eating  the                Eucharistic  bread  idly,  but  winning  the  altar's  ministers  with   406                her prayer from then on.                      We think that the apostles did the same. When the Holy                Spirit reminded them what Jesus had said and commanded,                how they obeyed zealously!                      Also  Alapide  thinks  so  when  he  explains  the  above                passages  from  St.  Matthew  and  St.  Luke.  In  fact,  before                joining  the  new  apostle  Matthias  to  the  Sacred  College  by                drawing lots, the apostles prayed (Act. 1, 24).                      The  holy  Church  makes  us  repeat  in  the  apostles'                preface the following beautiful, remarkable words: « It is truly                worthy,  right,  convenient,  and  beneficial  that  we  pray                insistently,  o  Lord  eternal  shepherd,  not  to  abandon  your                flock. »","8. PRIESTHOOD IS FOUNTAIN OF GOOD                      Only the Catholic priesthood can spread the light of the                truth  all  over  the  world.  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  said  to  the                priests: « You are like salt for all mankind. But, if salt loses its                taste,  there  is  no  way  to  make  it  salty  again...  You are  like                light for the whole world » (Mt. 5, 13-14). It is as though he                had said: how can the souls find salvation without ministers?                      All complain about the pitiable situation of so many cities                and nations. Well then, God made the  nations curable, and                no  means  is  more  beneficial  than  plenty  of  evangelical                workers.                      What  institution  of  faith  and  charity  can  be  conceived                without  the  Catholic  priesthood?  Aren't  the  priests  the  new                Christ  sent  to  the  world  as  Jesus  himself  was  sent  by  the                Father?...  Only  the  priesthood  is  able  both  to  destroy  the                kingdom of sin and to change the face of the earth. Its power                is unlike the worldly power; it is a divine force, a miraculous   407                secret  attracting  hearts  and  making  the  contrary  powers,                terrestrial  and  hellish,  impotent.  Nineteen  centuries  of                Christianity show and strengthen this truth evidently. Without                the priesthood's divine efficacy it is impossible to explain both                the  supreme  prodigy  of  the  apostles,  who  regenerated                humankind through the cross' foolishness, and the wonders                that  the  apostolical  men  worked to  support the  Church and                save  souls.  Also  the  Catholic  laity  is  a  fountain  of                innumerable workers. But, how could the Catholic laity exist                without the priesthood which creates it directly or indirectly?                And  the  sacred  virgins,  who  commit  themselves  to  the                spiritual and temporal beneficence of the neighbor, are also                daughters of the Catholic priesthood.                     The divine word is always a sublime synthesis which","holds  innumerable  mysteries,  spreading  manifold  teachings                to us.                      The divine Rogate ergo must be considered not only in                relation  to  the  priests  who  are  raised  by  the  supreme                vocations obtained by the obedience to the divine command,                but  also  in  relation  to  the  persons  that  God  raises  for  the                good of his Church and for the souls.                      As some persons sow and others harvest, some people                water  the  blooming  seed  with  their  tears  and  others  come                home happy with the reaped sheaves, some separate wheat                from  straw  and  others  keep  it  in  the  barns  and  others                distribute it, so several agents work for the eternal salvation                oaf the souls in the social classes. (9)                      The first agents are the princes of the nations, the kings,                the  statesmen,  and  the  government  or  administration  high                officers, who are abler to cooperate with the Church and the                Catholic  priesthood  for  the  salvation  of  the  souls.  Oh,  how                much  the  culture  of  the  souls'  mystical  harvest  depends  on   408                those who are in power! The Catholic, pious rulers who are                children of the holy Church, fearing, loving God, and humbly                submitting  themselves  to  Jesus  Christ's  vicar,  are  the                religion's right hand because they are able to do a very great                good in the mystical field of the souls' harvest.                      For that reason the holy Church wants the faithful to pray                for  peace  and  agreement  among  the  Christian  princes,                placing  suitable  prayers  in  the  liturgy;  therefore,  when  they                want to carry out that great command of Jesus' Heart's divine                zeal by praying to win good workers to the holy Church, they                have  to  put  the  special  intention  to  win  rulers  according  to                God's will.                      Good workers of the mystical harvest are also the","educators, because education implies the most holy Heart of                Jesus' interests. Plenty of bad educators are the scourge, the                hurricane, the storm, the tornado, which overthrows, upsets,                and  engulfs  the  earth!  Bad  educators  are  the  atheistical  or                miscreant  or  dishonest  teachers;  poor  the  pupils  who  have                such teachers!                      Obedience to the divine Rogate also implies the duty to                ask the divine goodness for sending out teachers, educators,                and  directors  of  the  institutes  who  are  believers,                church-goers, and God-fearing. They can teach the mind and                educate the heart of their pupils.                      This prayer also helps the parents as those who handle                the great harvest of the new generations; through this prayer                they  receive  enlightenment  and  grace  from God,  edify  their                children, keep them away from dangers, educate them in a                holy  manner,  and  present  them  to  God  in  compliance  with                their mission.                      But, how few are the parents such as these, how often   409                house and family are a dreadful enemy of the human being!                Education  was  properly  defined:  «The  most  delicate  art                placed in the most inexpert hands. »                     Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest...                           9. PRAYER STRENGTHENING ACTION                      What  is  the  value  of  action  without  prayer?  Do  not                people work in vain, if they want to build the house without                God's  help?  «  Every  good  gift  and  every  perfect  present                comes from heaven; it comes down from God, the Creator of                heavenly lights » (James 1, 17).                      If  we  want  good  ministers  and  holy  vocations  of  elect                workers  in  the  mystical  harvest,  we must  pray  because  the                vocation  prayer  as  obedience  to  the  divine  command  is                indispensable.  In  the  first  centuries  of  the  Church,                commenting on this passage of St. Matthew,","S. Hilary says: «God gives us this gift through prayer. » In his                fervent prayer to the Most Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus                Christ,  St.  Albert  the  Great  exclaims:  «  O  Most  Precious                Blood,  we  adore  you  in  the  holy  Eucharist  where  you  stay                substantially... Please pour out on the Church, fecundate her                with the saints, enrich her with angelical souls like flowers in                the Father's celestial garden to spread their gentle fragrance                all over the world. » Faber commented on this passage of the                gospel in his work « Conciones, » quoting St. Jerome (Book 2                on the letter to the Galathians): « Let us pray to the owner of                the harvest that he will send out workers to harvest, to reap                the  Christian  people's  ears  of  grain  which  are  prepared  for                the Church's future bread, and to gather them in the granary,                never decaying. »                      Also  Sacy  in  his  comment  on  the  gospel  says:  «  The                evangelical  workers'  mission  must  be  the  effect  of  the                Church's  prayer.»  Blessed  Vincent  Pallotti  published  a  brief                prayer which begins with:  « For the sacred mysteries oaf the                human redemption, send, o  Lord, workers in your harvest. »   410                And St. Louis M. Grignion de Monfort wrote a long, sublime                prayer  to  bend  divine  goodness  to  grant  such  a  matchless                mercy. (10)                      Always  moved  by  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  Church  disposes                the  Ember  days  in  the  quarterly  three  day  period  of  prayer                and fasting, which are destined to the sacred ordinations, to                ask  good  workers  for  the  spiritual  more  than  the  material                harvest. The gospel says that our Lord Jesus Christ prayed                all night long before calling the apostles. Thus, he taught us                that  such  a  great mercy,  which  is  mother  of  many  mercies,                must  be  obtained  through  great  prayers!  It  cannot  be                otherwise. God wanted the people to wish and to pray for the                coming of Jesus Christ in the world. Because the priests are","the new Christ, we have to wish and to ask for them through                prayer  (Speech  at  the  Eucharistic  Congress  of  Catania,                1905).                      This prayer also urges to action, because the new clergy                must originate both from prayer and action. When the Rogate                prayer  becomes  popular,  it  will  make  pious  and  eminent                persons understand the great moment of such a prayer and                the  great moment  of having elect  priests  according  to  God,                moving  them  to  grant  the  means  (11)  necessary  to  their                education and success.                      The  Catholic  institutions  which  aim  at  helping  the  holy                missions,  strive  to  collect  alms  for  them,  which  is                praiseworthy. However, it shouldn't be less praiseworthy and                beneficial adding an extensive advertisement for the vocation                prayer, in obedience to the divine command; thus, they would                increase  secular  and  regular  clergies  through  pecuniary,                moral, and spiritual means.                      In short, we must pray and work to win good workers to   411                the holy Church. When we ask God for a favor, we have to                cooperate in order to reach it more easily. For instance, if we                pray  for  the  conversion  of  sinners,  our  prayer  is  more                efficacious and the conversion is easier if we add our means                and work to convert the sinners.                      Likewise, we must not be satisfied by only wishing and                praying to win good workers to the holy Church, but we must                add means and work to achieve them. Oh, how all things are                fast bound to each other!                                10. REMEDY OUT OF FASHION                      I think that this great remedy has been remembered and                used very seldom in the last twenty centuries; our Lord Jesus                Christ's great word has been almost buried,","unobserved  in  the  Gospel's  pages.  Perhaps  it  has  been  a                great punishment that humankind deserved.                      Ah! We pray for rain, for year's crop, for liberation from                divine punishments, and for so many topics, but we neglect to                pray  for  winning  good  evangelical  workers  to  the  mystical                harvest.                      A  servant  of  God  once  asked:  «  Lord,  why  don't  you                send  numerous  priests  according  to  your  Heart  to  the  holy                Church?  »  Jesus  is  said  to  have  answered:  «  Because  the                people do not ask enough for them. » This is the reason why                today good workers are so rare, why millions and millions of                sours are lacking spiritual help and are deprived of the light of                truth, which the Catholic priesthood only can give. How few                the clerics in the seminaries have become!                      Well  then,  why  don't  we  resort  to  the  infallible  remedy                our Lord Jesus Christ pointed to with these words: « Pray to                the  owner  of  the  harvest  that  he  will  send  out  workers  to                gather in his harvest? » Why don't the souls who love Jesus   412                Christ  and  his  divine  heart's  interests  lift  up  most  fervent                prayers  to  win  good  workers  to  the  mystical  harvest?  Why                don't the prayer books used by the pious souls overflow with                this  divine  prayer?  Why,  don't  the  Eucharistic  congresses                pick  up  this  prayer  as  their  primary  subject?  Why  don't  the                preachers  of  the  divine  word  urge  the  faithful  to  obey  the                divine command that Jesus gave many times? »                      Several Pious Unions for the Sanctification of the Clergy                are greatly esteemed by the people. Various religious orders                of  nuns  are  commanded  by  rule  to  pray  for  that.  That's  all                right. We, however, remark that praying directly and explicitly                for  new,  strong,  holy,  and  powerful  vocations  is  more                beneficial  and  more  related  to  the  divine  exhortation  or                command, because we ask","the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  to  form  his  saints.  (12)  While                explaining this saying of our Lord Jesus Christ, Alapide notes                that when God hears this prayer, all the workers he sends to                the holy Church are saints.                      His Eminence Card. Prefect of Propaganda Fide wisely                implored  and  obtained  from  the  Holy  Father  Pius  XI  the                introduction  of  a  new  verse  in  the  Litany  of  the  Saints  to                reduce  the  unfaithful  and  the  dissident  in  the  Mother                Church's  bosom.  But,  can  it  happen  without  increasing  the                missionaries'  number?  Can  the  missionaries'  number                increase  without  fervently  complying  with  our  Lord's                command?  Who  says  this  prayer?  Whoever  does  not  ask,                does not receive; whoever prays little, receives little.                                  11. PEOPLE MUST PRAY                      Which  people  are  obliged  to  pray  for  this  grace  of  the                graces, this mercy of the mercies?                        413                      They are:                      1. The holy Church's bishops and the ecclesiastics.                The  divine  exhortation  was  specifically  addressed  to  the                ecclesiastical  order,  or  better  yet,  to  the  Church,  which  is                represented  by  the  apostles;  in  fact,  Jesus  our  Lord                addressed those words to them: « He said to his disciples. »                The Church must pray formally for this purpose, because the                prayer's mission to win good workers concerns not only each                faithful  Christian  having  at  heart  the  good  of  souls  but                concerns  specifically  the  bishops,  the  shepherds  of  the                mystical flock, to whom the souls are entrusted; in short, the                living apostles of Jesus Christ.","2.  The  superiors  of  the  religious  orders.  They  long  for                holy vocations to their institutes as much as the bishops do                for their dioceses.                      3. The priests. 11 dare to address a warm appeal to the                priests,  who  are  my  lords.  We  must  get  hold  of  the  new                generations,  generating  them  to  the  grace  through  the  holy                baptism and defending them from the rapacious wolves. We,                however, are very few everywhere. Very few workers! People                did not ask them, we ourselves did not. We have not used the                remedy  commanded  by  Jesus  Christ  and,  therefore,  are                suffering  the  consequences:  hundreds  of  parishes  have  no                priest. We ought to stir ourselves, work, and .pray!                      4.  The  clerics.  Several  bishops  asked me  for  vocation-                prayer-books  for  their  dioceses,  especially  for  the  religious                communities;  but,  it  is  of  importance  that  they  have                introduced the recitation of this prayer in their seminaries; that                helps  very  much  the  culture  and  the  promotion  of  holy                vocations.  When  this  prayer  is  organized  and  enters  the                seminaries,  the  clerics  will  have  a  specific  to  follow,   414                understanding which is the success of their vocation and how                to  reach  it.  Furthermore,  the  prayers  will  make  them                experience God's work in themselves for the increase of their                vocation, knowing that only God may let them become elect                priests  and  holy  workers  in  the  great  field  of  the  mystical                harvest.  We  cannot  have  the  «  chosen  race,  the  king's                priests,  the  holy  nation  »  (1  Peter  2,  9)  through  a  feeble,                uncertain,  imperfect,  artificial,  man-made  vocation.  Such                vocations  may  prompt  priests  endowed  with  sacred                character, but they will never succeed as experience teaches.                      5. Nuns and sisters. As loving souls of Jesus","Christ  as  well  as  zealous  for  his  glory,  nuns  and  sisters                should pray for holy vocations.                      O  pious  souls,  souls  lovers  of  Jesus  Christ,  O  souls                zealous for the interests of the most holy Heart of Jesus and                his  Most  Precious  Blood;  O  virgins  consecrated  to  Jesus,                your  divine  spouse,  bound  to  promote  his  glory  and  the                salvation  of  the  souls;  you  who  are  willing  to  sanctify                yourselves acquiring merits for the eternal life, please pick up,                adopt that divine command in your heart: pray continuously,                do not stop praying to win elect priests, holy and numerous                workers from divine mercy, because the sound of this prayer                is pleasant to God's ears. The Song of the Song's words:  «                Let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet» (Song 2, 14)                suit each of you.                      6.  The  faithful.  The  faithful  must  understand  that  the                greatest mercy God may have on the people or a city is his                sending out elect priests, as he did with his only Son Jesus                said to his disciples: « As the Father sent me, so I send you »                (Jn.  20,  21).  Vice  versa,  the  greatest punishment  God  may   415                give is depriving the people of his ministers, or better yet, of                the priests according to his heart.                      The  faithful  must  understand  this  duty,  accustoming                themselves  to  pray  that  the  Lord  send  out  the  priests  to                catechize,  to  administer  the  sacraments,  and  to  guide  the                people to eternal life.                              12. EUCHARIST AND PRIESTHOOD                      When our Lord Jesus Christ instituted the sacrament of                the Eucharist giving it to the apostles at the","last supper, he was keeping in mind the whole Church along                with  its  members,  whom  he  had  to  feed  with  the  bread  of                eternal life.                      In that event he instituted and conferred his priesthood                on  the  apostles.,  empowering  them  to  consecrate  his  body                and  his  Most  Precious  Blood,  as  well  as  to  absolve  the                people from their sins until the end of time. He did and meant                it  by  saying:  «  Do  this  in  memory  of  me  ».  Thus,  Christ's                priesthood is transmitted from bishops to priests, making the                sacramental presence of Jesus remain until the end of time.                      So,  Eucharist  and  priesthood  are  born  of  the  adorable                Heart  of  Jesus  by  a  twin  birth.  (13)  Both  sacraments  are                complementary to each other. The priesthood was called into                existence  for  the  consecration  and  administration  of  the                Eucharist to the people as well as for the absolution of sins.                The  Eucharist  is  called  into  existence  by  the  consecration                made by the priests, as established by our Lord at the end of                his life, which « ended with marvelous order, » as St. Thomas                Aquinas says in the Pange lingua.                         416                      The Eucharistic Congresses should not omit mentioning                the  great  command of  Jesus'  Heart  zeal:  « Pray,  therefore,                etc. » We cannot understand how the Congresses' organizers                may  exclude  from  the  plans  to  honor  the  most  Holy                Sacrament the plans concerning the formation of numerous,                holy priests as well as the plan to make the faithful lovers of                Jesus  Christ  obey  this  divine  command:  «  Pray,  therefore,                etc. » (Note to the Hymns on July first, 1926).","NOTES                     (1)   «We  have  called  this   beneficial,   most  fecund   prayer with                the name secret, because it contains a great secret: in fact, it can save                the holy Church through the spreading of faith, it can save the people,                the     cities,      the     nations,     and     human     society      through      the                numerous, elect priests, who like new Christs full of the  spirit of God,                who   uses  \"the  winds  as   messengers   and   fiery   flames   as                servants\"   (Ps.   104,   4),   would   make   humankind   one   flock                under  one shepherd.  May it be,   may   it   be! Amen.»     (Note    to  the                hymns of July  first,   1926;  this  was the  last   note written  by  our                padre, who through this « may it be» sealed his Eucharistic apostolate                on our feast of July first!)                    (2)    This  chapter  is  from    the  Pious  Union    Handbook,  save  the                passages whose sources are quoted.                    (3)   « With the command '\"Pray, therefore,...\" Jesus Christ pledged                to  send  out  persons  different  from  the  others;  they  should  be  clothed                with  a  divine  character and  raised  by  God   through  a  wonder  as                though they were  raised. from  the  rocks.  God  is  powerful  to  do that,                but he will  not do so,  unless we pray; as a  matter  of fact, he pledged                to do so  when we  pray for it»   (News and  Rules  for the Sacred Allies                Supporters).                    (4)  «To   tell   the   truth,   the   good   works   of   the   elects,   the                worship  of   God,   the   Church  and   the   faithful's   universal   prayers   417                earned  the  kingdom  of  God  and   its   justice  through  Jesus  Christ                and  the  most  holy  Virgin's  merits  and  prayers;  hence,  the  mystical                harvest   has   seen   evangelical   workers, that   were   like   angels   of                heaven,  almost  divine  beings,  wonder  of  heroism  and  holiness.  Who                could  deny  that?  How  many  are  the  ministers  of  God  shining   in                the  clergy?  How  many  are  the  luminaries  of  science  and  holiness?  It                would  be  a    big    mistake  saying    that  our  Lord  Jesus    Christ  said                needlessly:   \"Pray,  therefore,  etc.\"  and  that  obeying   perfectly   this                divine  command    does  not  attain    more    and    holier  workers  to    the                mystical harvest» (News and rules for the Sacred Allies supporters).                    (5)  It is a reference to the Sacred Alliance, chapter 6.                    (6)   «That he will send out workers to gather in his harvest. If the                harvest belongs to  God,  how  is  it  that we  must pray  God  to send                out workers to his harvest? The reason is that God has disposed to   do                everything      for      our     salvation      through      our     prayer;      for      an                unfathomable mystery, God's all-powerful will, to be fulfilled, needs the                human being's frail will. God cannot gather the harvest of the souls in                order to save  them, if  they  do   not pray, if  they  do not want  to pray»                (News and  rules for the Sacred Allies Supporters).                    (7)   < Let us consider how many merits the people acquire when                they say such a prayer.","They obtain from God what they ask for. For instance, the Lord will                send  out  a  powerful  vocation  to  an  elect  on  earth  because  of  the                assiduous,  humble  prayer  of  someone.  A  person  will  hear  in  his                innermost: \"Follow me!\" Still remaining free, the people cannot oppose                God's voice; therefore, the chosen one enters the sanctuary, is endowed                with understanding and spirit, is lighted with zeal for the sacred ministry,                and becomes an apostle or a missionary, or a pastor or a doctor or a                preacher or a savior of souls. He immolates the divine victim every day.                Through the divine office he wails between the vestibule and the altar,                spreads  Christ's  presence,  edifies  the  Church;  he  is  diferrent  from  a                common human being. Who knows the good he produces to the world                by his ministry? Such good will increase indefinitely until the end of the                time. God will reward this elect worker with ineffable prizes, but also the                person who obtained that vocation by praying: '\"Owner of the harvest,                owner  of  the  harvest,  send  workers  to  your  harvest\"  will  share  those                prizes. St. Vincent de Paul said: \"No work can be equal to the formation                of  one  priest\";  therefore,  anyone  who  is  able  to  help  the  formation  of                priests has to do it with a will; but to win priests according to God, let us                pray, let us pray, let us make other people pray the Lord to send them                out! \"Rogate!\" Pray, says the Lord to everyone. Let us pray» (News and                rules for the Sacred Allies supporters).                    (8)  Our divine Savior's example evidently shows the importance of                this prayer he suggested almost by commanding.  When he was about                to  call  the  first  ministers  of  the  new  law  of  grace,  those  who  were   418                destined to be the first fecund seed of the Catholic priesthood, what did                he do? Which means did he choose to form the 12 apostles' vocation?                Before   seeking   and   calling   them,   he   retired   on   the mountain                and   prayed!  He  prayed  \"on  the  mountain\"  to  make  his ardent                prayer ascend to the  Father directly; prayed  \"in the night\" so  that  no                human    approach    distract      him    from    the    enterprise      he  was                communicating   with   the   Father;   prayed   \"all   night   long\"   in order                to   implore   the   Father  by   sacrifice;   prayed   \"all   night   long,                shedding  tears  and  crying  'to  be  heard  by  the  Father'  because  of  his                reverence!\"  Still  soaked  with  tears  and    perspiration,  as  soon  as  he                came down from the mountain  he called the apostles to  make the first-                fruits  of  his eternal  priesthood. What a  great  teaching    he  gave  us  to                make  us  understand  how  much  we  must  pray  to  obtain  so  great  a                graces (News and rules for the Sacred Allies supporters).                    (9)  «The   priestly   apostolic   work   produces   many   coad|utors                such as lay persons or sisters or the people working with  zeal in the                Church  for the  eternal  salvation  of  the  souls.   Enlightened   by the                Lord, Catholic  kings  and  governors,  who  are  children  of  the Church,                may and must be the saviors of the mystical harvest which","is entrusted to them by fulfilling their great civil mission  (Note to the                hymn of July first, 1926).                    (10)  In  the biography  of the  Blessed  Fr.  Gennaro   M. Sarneliy                written  by  Fr.  Dumartier  (translated  by  Fr.  Bozzatra,  Festa  publisher,                page 104), we read a letter he addressed to a Religious, from which we                quote:   « In the  gospel  the Lord  says  to    his  disciples, my  dear,  look                around, see the nations of the world, see how many souls are ready  for                the   harvest:   the  harvest   is   abundant,   but  the   workers are few;                pray to the Lord of the harvest that he will send out the workers to his                harvest. All of you say often this ejaculatory prayer: Lord of the harvest,                Lord  of  the  harvest,  Lord  of  the  harvest,  send  out  workers  to  your                harvest.  Please  join  this prayer to the  merits of Jesus Christ's Most                Precious Blood and to his zeal for the glory of  the   Father and   the                salvation   of  souls.  Almighty   God,   creator of the souls, send out                numerous workers  to  gather  in your harvest.  We commend  the souls,                who  are  so  dear  to  you  »  (News  and  rules  for  the  Sacred  Allies                supporters).                    (11)    Writing   to   Blessed   Guido   M.   Conforti,   archbishop   of                Parma and founder of the Xavier's Missionnaries, our padre pointed out                the necessity to join prayer with action  (In this case  begging for  the                missions),   giving  preeminence  to  prayer;  after  praying  we can and                must  seek  contributions.  «  The  matter  is  to  be  managed  so  evidently                and   clearly    that    the  faithful     must     know    that their   alms  will  be                blessed  and  two  cents  will  be  worth  2000    liras  when  their  cents  are   419                joined  to  the  prayer  commanded  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ...  \"Pray,                therefore!\"  Please  consider  the  therefore!  Our  Lord  did  not  say:                therefore, work to form the priests; therefore,  gather  money, etc., but                he said: \"THEREFORE, PRAY!\" Both action and contribution for such an                aim  are  holy because  they are  implied  in  the  divine thought.  But,  it                is strange  that what  has  been   clearly  said  hardly receives attention,                whereas what is supposed to be implied receives full attention.»                    (12)  «The prayers the  religious communities say  by  rule,  not by                vow,  for  the  sanctification  of  the  clergy  do  not  concern  directly                numerous,  holy  vocations,   but   the   present   clergy's   sanctification.                Surely,   this  intention  is  holy,  most  holy,  and  those  who  say   this                prayer gain merits, but the results of this prayer are scarce because they                face  the  human  will  which  opposes  the  divine  grace.  This  appears                evident in the consecrated persons who do not improve their holiness.                    On  the  contrary,  the  prayer  or  rogation,  which  is  based  on  the                Rogate commanded by Jesus Christ, regards directly the sending out of                the  workers  to  his  harvest.  The  holy  vocations  of  new  priests  are                contained in the sending out, because it is God's promise to hear such a                prayer. He will raise persons favorably disposed, elected youths who are                dear to his Heart. He can infuse in them the powerful","breath of holy vocation which comes from the Holy Spirit. This call                is  irresistible  because  of  the  Holy  Spirit  operating  a  divine,  impulsive                force in the person who is called to the divine service and sacrifice; still                remaining free, the person is drawn to answer the call and has no quiet,                no peace until he accepts and acts upon the powerful impulse.                    These are the true called, the priests the Holy Spirit formed on the                ground of the divine prayer commanded by our Lord Jesus Christ: \"Pray,                therefore,\" etc.» (From various notes by the Padre).                    In  another  letter  to Blessed  Quido  M. Conforti,  our padre defines                the  nature  of  the  Rogate  prayer,  «which  is  different  from  the  prayers                aiming at the sanctification of the clergy. These prayers are excellent;                but  Your  Excellence  know  very  well  which  grace  is  needed  to  rouse                again an unrestrained minister of the Lord and to push him again in the                way  of  sanctification!...  Answering,  however,  the  divine  command  is                different!  Here,  the  matter  is  vocation  from  the  Holy  Spirit,  who                transformed the shy, insecure apostles into powerful vocations after ten                days  of  prayer.  God  is  having  such  vocations  in  his  hands,  but  he  is                expecting that the prayer commanded by him snatches them out of his                hands to come down in the hearts well prepared. Who knows how many                hundreds of thousands of vocations the Lord keeps in store? But, how                can people claim to have them without praying, while God commands us                to pray for it? »                    (13) Our padre refers to a hymn's stanza in honor of the Madonna:                «Remember: in a twin birth — in the mystical rite, he gave the world —   420                the best of him, that is the finest — the Eucharist, the infinite gift — and                the eternal priesthood.»","CHAPTER XXII                           YOU SHALL NOT SPARE YOURSELF                     While praying to God that he may fill the holy Church                and  the  world  with  good  evangelical  workers,  the                congregants of our least Institute will strive with ardent                zeal  and  sacrifice  to  be  good  evangelical  workers                themselves in the Lord's harvest. I see this duty as the                Immediate,  legitimate  consequence  which  derives  from                the appreciation, from the untiring culture, and from the                meditation  on  the  divine  Rogate  as  well  as  from  the                limitless  obedience  and  from  the  faithful  execution  of                this command.                     As  a  consequence  of  all  this,  I  will  never  spare                myself  in  the  work  for  the  Lord's  glory  and  the  souls'                salvation,  considering  myself  unfaithful,  lazy,  and                indifferent  when  I  am  not  thirsty  for  souls.  Therefore,  I                will excite in myself hunger and thirst for souls through                meditation,  fervent  prayer,  work,  and  self-denial.  But,   421                whether  I  feel  or  whether  I  do  not  feel  this  hunger  and                thirst  for  souls,  with  God's  help  and  my  constant                determination  I  will  never  stop  working  In  the  mystical                harvest of souls.                     To  fruitfully  work  for  the  sanctification  and  the                salvation  of  others,  first  I  will  endeavor  to  sanctify                myself.  Keeping  In  mind  the  saints'  teaching  that  our                Lord  Jesus  Christ  loves  one  soul  as  much  as  all souls                together,  and  that  he  would  have  endured  his  Passion                even  for  one  soul,  I  will  esteem  souls  so  much  as  to                spend  my  life  in  suffering,  in  working,  and  sacrificing                myself  even  for  one  soul.  Because  when  I  entered  the                order and when I was ordained priest the Lord endowed                me with gifts for my religious and priestly ministry, I will                use them for the divine glory and the salvation of souls,                knowing that I have to give a strict account of such gifts                to God In the judgment day.","1. ENERGETIC ZEAL                      Charity produces in itself the fervor and the flame which                rise  up  to  God,  and  draw  from  God's  love  and  glory  the                reasons to work more intensely on earth. Charity brings about                zeal for God's glory and the souls' salvation. It substitutes the                world's selfishness with altruism by involving the people in the                work for the good of others. They work continuously for God,                for the truth, for the good of their neighbor, and because they                are unable to embrace the whole world with their action, they                suffer for the evil which overflows in society (On the death of                L. Costa Sajia).                      The  spirit  of  sacrifice  is  the  outcome  of  zeal,  which                should characterize the spirit of each Rogationist. Therefore,                he will spare no sacrifice for God's glory and the souls' good,                but  will  face  work,  suffering,  inconvenience,  contradictions,                humiliation,  and  everything,  giving  up  Ms  time,  rest,  quiet,                health, and himself to sake even one soul (C.R.).                      While  praying  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that  he  will   422                send  out  numerous,  holy  workers  to  the  holy  Church,  the                Rogationists of Jesus' Heart strive with all their strength and                God's  help  to  become  themselves  workers  of  the  harvest.                They  will  perform  the  ecclesiastical  ministry,  such  as:                worship, confessions, preaching, missions, teaching Christian                doctrine  to  children...,  and  will  commit  themselves  to  the                spiritual  and  temporal  beneficence  through  the  orphanages,                the evangelization of the poor, etc. For the glory of God and                the good of the souls the pious order will give preference to                the  education  of  the  youths  who  aspire  to  become  priests,                being  ready  to  help  the  diocesan  seminaries  when  the                bishops  ask  for  it,  and  the  order  has members  qualified  for                such important, holy office (C.R.).","With God's help, the Rogationists of Jesus' Heart commit                themselves to the work of priestly ministry and to the spiritual                and the temporal beneficence.                      As to the priestly ministry: 1) The Rogationists will direct                the churches and the oratories entrusted to them by attracting                the  people  through  assiduous,  untiring,  holy  ministry  and                through the industries that charity and zeal will suggest. 2) To                facilitate the concourse of the people, especially the poor, the                seats  of  the  church  will  be  free  of  charge.  3)  They  will                promote feasts, pious unions for children and adults, general                communions,  retreats,  and  the  like.  4)  They  will  foster  love                toward our Lord Jesus Christ in all his mysteries, such as: the                child Jesus, the suffering Jesus, and the Holy Sacrament. 5)                The  center  of  all  devotions  and  activities  will  be  the  Holy                Sacrament.  Our  order  will  love,  honor,  and  court  the  Holy                Sacrament  with  such  a  bliss  as  to  be  called  a  Eucharistic                Order. Besides the yearly feasts of the most Holy Sacrament,                the  spreading  of  its  worship  and  the  daily  Communion,  the                order  will  celebrate  the  real  presence  of  the  most  Holy                Sacrament through the Eucharistic Day on July First, as we   423                have been doing from the beginning of the order. 6) Love of                the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary  will  be  fostered  with  the  same                affection and fervor. 7) For a complete and fecund teaching of                the Christian doctrine to children, the best programs will be                carried out with love and zeal, while catechism contests and                rewards will attract and win the love of children. The teaching                of catechism to the girls will be entrusted to the sisters, who                will  organize  the  first  Communions  on  special  holidays.  8)                The  Rogationists  will  hold  the  missions  in  the  abandoned                towns and to the unprivileged classes as the worthiest work,                using the mission's most reliable systems.                      Everytime the Rogationists are called for the dying, they                will assist them charitably, giving them the sacraments","and preparing them for the great passage to eternity through                holy  exhortations.  The  Rogationists  will  also  concern                themselves with legitimatising marriages (C.R).                      To answer faithfully their holy vocation, the Little Retreat                sisters  will  strive  to achieve their  own  sanctification  through                religious  virtues  as  well  as  to  become  good  workers  in  the                holy Church. Specifically: they will commit themselves to the                education  of  abandoned  orphans,  to  the  help  and  the                evangelization  of  the  poor,  and  to  any  eventual  charitable                work, to which they are called. They will perform everything to                please  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  his  most  holy  mother,  to                earn merits for eternal life, and to foster the salvation of souls                (R.L.P.).                      The  sisters  who  are  committed  to  the  education  and                success  of  the  orphans  must  begin  and  persevere  in  their                work with a spirit of sacrifice. They will not spare themselves                nor  their  habits,  their  spiritual  comfort  and  delight  included,                because they lose nothing of what they renounce, they rather   424                grow richer in God's eyes (S.I.G.).                      To immolate themselves for the glory of God, to please                the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  and  to  work  for  the  holy                Church's needs and for the salvation and the sanctification of                souls,  the  sisters  will  nurture  the  spirit  of  self-denial,                considering  no  work  or  sacrifice  as  too  heavy.  With  such  a                disposition  and  by  renouncing  their  will  and  opinion,  the                sisters  will  offer  themselves  as  victims  of  holy  obedience,                victims of the work they undertake with all their physical and                moral  strength,  as  well  as  victims  of  the  deprivation,                humiliation, and suffering that the Lord will permit. They will                long  for  nothing  else  but  to  please  the  most  holy  Heart  of                Jesus and to save souls (D.S.S.).                      To  fulfill  their  fourth  vow,  they  will  combine action  with                prayer to win good workers to the holy Church. The","action  may  be:  1)  teaching  others  the  vocation  prayer;  2)                educating  and  exhorting  children;  3)  working  and  begging                alms to help the poor clerics the saving will be placed into the                Peter's pence box; (1) 4) educating the orphans, praying for                everything  and  for  all,  assisting  the  sick,  doing  works  of                charity, etc. (Purpose of the fourth vow, July 19, 1888).                       Your name is Daughters of Divine Zeal. You are wearing                the  emblem  of  the  divine  Heart  along  with  the  evangelical                words: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest that he                will send out workers to gather in his harvest. »  Both name                and  evangelical  emblem  urge  you  to  promote  with  all  your                strength and self-denial the adorable Heart of Jesus' interests                and  everything  which  concerns  his  glory  and  the  good  of                souls. From the time you have committed yourselves to the                divine  zeal,  which  made  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  exclaim:  «                Zeal for your house devours me » (Ps. 69, 9), you are called                to the office of Martha and Mary Magdalene.                      Since  the  world  is  full of  souls  that  are  being  lost,  you   425                shall  not  seek  your  salvation  only,  but  you  shall  snatch  as                many souls as you can from eternal ruin. Please gather the                abandoned  orphans.  Teach,  educate,  and  feed  them.  Each                soul you save is a seed of eternal salvation for many others,                who will become your glorious crown in heaven. Please long,                be hungry and thirsty for the remnant souls you are unable to                save.  Be  not  indifferent  in  the  face  of  the  ruin  of  even  one                soul, for Jesus Christ paid out his blood for that soul that is as                precious as all souls are together (Speech, St. Joseph 1908).                  2. FALSE ZEAL                      We must beware of the enemy's deceit, of selfishness,                and, particularly, of the false zeal which kills meekness","True zeal is born of charity and is gifted like charity, as St.                Paul says: « Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or                conceited  or  proud;  love  is  not  ill-mannered  or  selfish  or                irritable; love does not keep a record of wrongs; love is not                happy with evil, but is happy with the truth. Love' never gives                up: its faith, hope, and patience never fail. » True zeal is a                living,  ardent,  calm,  an  always  industrious  flame  which  is                concerned  with  everything  and  everyone,  but  without  dash                and  rashness.  Whoever  can  be  more  zealous  than  Jesus                Christ, who was devoured by zeal? And yet, he said: « Learn                from me, because I am gentle and humble in spirit » (Mt. 11,                29).  Did  he  ever  get  angry?  Once,  when  he  demanded                respect for God's house. For the remnant 33 years and in a                special  way  during  the  ignominy,  the  injustice,  and  the                suffering of his Passion he let the executioners drive him to                Calvary like a lamb, without lamenting. The Psalmist had said                that he would behave like one who scolds no one. St. Francis                of Sales says that the angels are extremely zealous for the                salvation  of  their  proteges,  but  they  are  not  at  all  uneasy.                When  zeal  becomes  agitated,  it  shows  itself  to  be  false,                because it is written: « God was not in the wind, » and our   426                Lord recommended: « Do not be worried and upset » (Jn. 14,                1). False  zeal  comes  from  selfishness, not  from the  love  of                God or of one's neighbor. Instead of correcting and edifying,                false  zeal  scandalizes,  sets  bad  example,  and  causes  bad                results.                      Our  order  has  to  shine  with  pure  charity.  The  Roga-                tionists who want to be really concerned with the interest of                Jesus' Heart must do their utmost with prayer and action to                reach a lively, ardent, calm, and moderate zeal.                      The person consecrated to Jesus must be zealous first                for punishing and restraining himself as well as for","seeking  his  own  sanctification  diligently.  When  the  zeal  is                practiced interiorly, it may be less moderate, but for exterior                acts of humiliation and penance it must follow the rules and                obedience.  The  interior  annihilation  of  selfishness,  opinion,                will, and egotism must be preferred to the exterior penitential                acts.                      The  Rogationist  will  long  for  the  sanctification  and  the                eternal salvation of all souls, no one excepted. To reach this                goal,  he  will  ask  the  Lord  for  numerous,  elect  priests,                numerous  saints  of  heroic  virtue,  at  least  two  saints  for  a                thousand people on earth. Meantime, he will sacrifice himself                for the glory of God and the salvation of souls (R.S.).                                   3. THE. DIVINE FOUNDER                      The loving, fecund, dutiful, and continuous center of this                pious  institute  of  Jesus'  interests  is  Jesus  in  the  Holy                Sacrament.  From  now  on,  the  people  must  know  that  the   427                true, effective, and immediate founder of this pious institute is                Jesus in the Holy Sacrament. Of this foundation we may say:                «  God  did  something  new.  »  In  fact,  usually  he  puts  a                flounder rich with his graces and gifts in his institutions. This                institute instead, which was born to promote his Heart's divine                command that has been neglected for so many centuries, has                our Lord himself in the sacred tabernacle as the real founder.                Graces, help, enlightenment, and providence poured out from                his divine heart in the Sacrament.                      The pious institute began rising in the miserable, abject                slums of the poor. After a few years since the priest set foot                there, a little house was rented and transformed into a little                chapel,  where  the  first  mass  was  celebrated  on  a  little                wooden altar. Thus, Jesus in the","Holy  Sacrament  began  taking  possession  of  those  places,                sowing  the  seed  of  this  new  plant  in  the  poor's  field.  The                sporadic celebration of the mass was the sporadic presence                of  Jesus;  but  his  permanent  presence  in  the  Eucharistic                Sacrament was indispensable for the seed to take root and                fructify.                      Then,  a  singular  loving  expectation  for  the  Lord  in  the                Sacrament was cultivated among those poor, but especially                in  the  hearts  of  their  children,  boys  and  girls  who  were                attending the school of catechism alternatively, while some of                them were already sheltered.                      The little chapel was enlarged by joining another house;                a better altar with a tabernacle replaced the old one, and the                holy  expectation  for  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament  was  cultivated                through more prayers, teachings, and songs. To foster in the                people's  hearts  the  wish  for  the  coming  of  God,  who  is                concealed in the Sacrament, the tabernacle was kept open.                The expectation increased for two years.                                                                          428                     It was the expectation for the divine Messiah, who had to                be born in this new Bethlehem as God-man concealed in the                Eucharist, to dwell among the children of men until the end of                time, to find his delights in the pure hearts.                      When  the  common  expectation  was  fully  developed,                Jesus  came.  He  came  on  July  first,  1886,  during  the  cele-                bration  of  the  holy  mass,  while  the  people  in  the  adorned                chapel were longing, singing, and praying to him devoutly.                      He came to remain permanently. He came as a king to                set  his  kingdom  in  the  midst  of  his  citizens,  as  a  good                shepherd  to  feed  the  sheep  entrusted  to him,  the  flock  that                had  to  live  with  him  without  fear.  He  came  as  the  divine                farmer to cultivate his little plant, which had the seed of his                divine ROGATE in suffering and mortification.                      He came as a very loving father in the midst of his","children to form a small family living on his body and blood,                and  to  make  it  able  to  receive  from  his  divine  lips  the                command of his heart's divine zeal: « PRAY, THEREFORE,                TO THE OWNER OF THE HARVEST THAT HE WILL SEND                OUT WORKERS TO GATHER IN HIS HARVEST. »                      When Jesus came in the Sacrament, the pious institute                was yet a bambino in the number of its members, but, it rose                as a small caravan to start a very intricate pilgrimage. It was                always supported by the true Ark of the Covenant, which was                not containing the symbolical manna, but the real bread from                heaven.                      From  that  time  we  have  been  renewing  Jesus'  most                loving  coming  to  the  pious  institute  through  our  devoted                preparation for the beautiful feast of the Eucharistic Day on                July first.                      This pious institute's trial sometimes was very sorrowful,                and it lasted about 25 years; but its divine founder, Jesus in                the  Sacrament,  supported  and  helped  his  foundation  in   429                everything.  In  those  times,  needs  almost  suffocated  the                institute, but we turned to Jesus in the Sacrament and the sky                cleared up. Jesus was our providence and our health.                                    4. PAY ATTENTION!                      Please pay attention to the report of the priest, promoter,                or better yet, to the priest who set things moving under the                Lord's initiative.                      The trial became extreme and most suffocating after 22                years. The priest's last means was resorting to Jesus in the                Sacrament.  He  wrote  the  most  fervent,  cogent,  convincing                petition  to  touch  the  inmost  feelings  of  Jesus'  Heart  in  the                Sacrament as with an arrow. After opening the tabernacle  -                God forgive, if it happened so - or","perhaps  after  the  Holy  Communion  during  the  mass,  he                placed that petition under the sacred pyx.                      Jesus  accepted  it.  Since  then,  the  sky  began  clearing,                and Jesus in the host began spreading new splendors, which                became beams of light, grace, and providence. The institute                began, increasing.                      All this has been written to perpetuate the memory of it,                and  to  make  each  one  bear  in  mind  that  Jesus  in  the                Sacrament  is  the  author  of  this  pious  institute,  which  is                consecrated  to  his  divine,  real  heart,  always  loving  and                palpitating  in  the  holy  tabernacle;  that  Jesus  is  always                working in the midst of us with the same grace and with the                enlightenments  he  irradiates  continuously  from  the  burning                furnace of his divine Heart in the Sacrament.                      For that reason we have to direct to the adorable Jesus                in  the  Sacrament  all  our  thanks,  praises,  affections,  sighs,                desires, thoughts, love, and our being. He must be the center,                the  life,  the  existence,  the  hope,  the  perseverance,  and  all   430                things  for  us  and  for  the  future  congregants.  For  the                Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  and  for  those  who  live  with  them                may Jesus in the Sacrament be the mystical beehive, around                which they rotate, resting and producing the sweetest honey                of the virtues that please Jesus, supreme goodness.                                   5. FEAST ON JULY FIRST                      This is a first-rate festivity for the pious institute of Jesus'                Heart interests.                      The  order,  the  congregants,  and  the  houses,  no  one                excepted,  offer  this  yearly  tribute  of  love  and  faith  to  the                adorable  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament,  who  is  the  center  of  the                institute's  love,  sacrifices,  atonements,  thanksgivings,                petitions, prayers, practices of piety, and holy hopes. He","is the fountain of the past and present graces, mercies, and                favors as well as of the future graces that he will pour out on                this  pious  institute  and  its  members.  This  feast  is  the                expression  of  our  gratitude  for  Jesus'  loving  sweetest                dwelling  in  the  midst  of  us  despite  our  failings  and                unfaithfulness, our languid faith and incomplete answer to his                love and inspirations.                      This festivity is associated to the first permanent coming                of Jesus in the Sacrament in the midst of the poor beggars                and their children, on July first 1886, when the institute was                among the slums of Avignone Houses in Messina. After two                years of expectation, which was cultivated by instructions and                practices  of  piety  before  the  empty  tabernacle  in  the                temporary  oratory,  the  adorable  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  coming                down  from  the  right  hand  of  the  Father,  from  heaven  of                heavens, arrived during the mass, in the solemn moment of                the consecration, taking his dwelling in that tabernacle.                      Beginning  with  the  first  anniversary  in  1887,  the  loving                expectation  is  renewed  every  year,  and  we  hope  it  will  be   431                always renewed with the Lord's help.                               6. EUCHARISTIC PROCESSIONS                      On  Corpus  Christi  and  on  other  festivities,  the  internal                procession with the most adorable Eucharistic Sacrament will                be  organized  with  the  permission  of  the  ecclesiastical                authority  These  processions  may  be planned  in  the  houses                which  have  ample  rooms,  corridors,  gardens,  and  wide                terraces.                      Beginning  with  Pangs  Lingua,  the  sacred  Latin  hymns                will  be  sung  in  choral  manner  during  the  procession.  The                psalms, Magnificat,  Laudate  Dominum,  and others  canticles                may be used. If the procession lasts long, also","Italian hymns such as the one of July first may be used. The                sacristan  or  another  sister  will  prepare  an  altar  with  lighted                candles  and  corporal  at  a  station.  When  the  procession                arrives, the Holy Sacrament will be placed on the altar. After                spending some time in adoration and prayer, the sisters will                sing  again  the  Tantum  Ergo,  before  the  priests  gives  the                blessing.                      The  procession  may  return  to  the  church  through  the                same  or  another  or  a  shorter  way,  depending  on  time.  Te                Deum is the appropriate hymn during the return, unless it is                sung in the church or in the oratory.                      All must be mindful that our Lord distributes great graces                and mercies while he passes through in procession, and that                the people may obtain the favors they did not obtain before.                      When our Lord passed through the cities of Judea or the                streets of Jerusalem accompanied by his disciples, the pious                women, and the crowd,  how many graces he granted! How                many miracles he worked!                                  432                      The  processions  in  the  holy  Church,  in  the  Catholic                cities, in the towns, in the houses of the religious communities                are the repetition of the processions, travels, and walks that                Jesus did in Judea and Jerusalem. Just as the deaf or mute                or  blind  or  paralytic  or  lepers  or  victims  of  oppression  of                Jesus'  time  were  liberated  or  were  granted  the  favors,  so                during  the  processions,  when  the  same  Jesus  walks                concealed in the Holy Sacrament with the same  charity and                his  divine  Heart  open,  the  persons  who  follow  him  praying                with faith, loving trust, and profound humility can obtain the                spiritual  or  temporal  graces,  on  condition  that  such  graces                improve  the  well-being  of  their  soul.  The  procession  is  the                time to pray for ourselves and for the interests of his divine","Heart.  The  prayers  may  be,  said  mentally  or  intentionally,                even when the people sing psalms or praise.                      When our Lord in the Sacrament is placed on the attar,                the  community  may  present  the  petition  it  prepared                beforehand in order to win special graces.                      After re-entering the church or the oratory, it is advisable                that the priest make an exhortation to the community before                the blessing (S.D.D.Z.). (2)                                7. EUCHARISTIC CONGRESSES                 At your congresses what sublime sights!                You see people and people waving,                Crowds, multitudes, levites,                Even the insecure and the old bending.                      We are referring to the sublime Eucharistic congresses   433                that  .are  triumphing  all  over  the  Catholic  world.  They  are                planned by a commission of high ecclesiastical personalities                together  with  lay  Catholics  of  rank,  who  gather  around  the                organizing authority to define the best way of honoring Jesus                in  the  Sacrament.  This  planning  is  the  first  phase.  The                second phase puts the plan in action.                      The  momentous  gathering  of  the  people  is  planned                beforehand  by  prelates  of  the  holy  Church,  bishops,  arch-                bishops,  and  cardinals,  according  to  the  congress'  im-                portance.  Usually,  the  Holy  Father  entrusts  a  cardinal  with                representing him; by so doing the pope leads the people . to                understand the meaning of the real presence of Jesus Christ,                God-man in the consecrated host.                      The Eucharistic congress lasts for a few days; the clergy                of the various churches strive to prepare the population to the                great solemnity through preaching, confessions","and  Holy  Communion  as  well  as  by  exposing  the  Blessed                Sacrament for adoration. The main church or the cathedral of                the city where the congress takes place exposes the Blessed                Sacrament for a few days, even by night. In the last morning,                general  Communion  of  the  people  and  first  Communion  of                children   are   organized   with   impressive   solemnity:                Communions are by the thousands. At last, the organization                reaches the summit degree with the afternoon procession of                the  Holy  Sacrament  escorted  by  the  clergy  and  imposing                concourse of people.                      Since the purpose of the Congress is to bring together                many people, we note that the concourse and the crowds are                always so great that only an obvious concourse of omnipotent                grace may explain it. The people of any class and condition                who  participate  in  the  solemn  procession  come  from  far-off                towns  and  cities  on  foot,  by  train,  cars,  etc.;  they  are                gentlemen,  workers,  ladies,  titled  persons,  members  of                parliament, and crowds.                      Unbelievers  are  as  astounded  as  they  are  thoughtful.   434                Some of them even follow the procession, which lasts several                hours,  and  no  one  gets  tired.  The  participants  numbered  a                million  in  the  Genoa  Eucharistic  congress,  where  the  Holy                Father's  Cardinal  Legate  gave  the  solemn  blessing  from  a                ship,  prepared  by  the  government.  Also  the  king  was                represented by a deputy.                      We put a question: what do people see in the Eucharistic                congresses?  Do  they  see  a  statue  of  a  saint  or  the  Virgin                Mary carved by the chief worldly artist such as Michelangelo?                Or perhaps a most attractive picture of Our Lady's miraculous                image  by  a  painter  such  as  Raphael?  Not  at  all.  Nothing                fascinates eyes or sense. The people see a wafer of  a few                centimeters  in  diameter;  which  is  closed  in  a  monstrance                carried by a Lord's minister","We could even say that almost all the people see nothing                because of the crowds, and yet they rush, pray, and become                excited.                      In Chicago, the Americans prepared a Eucharistic Con-                gress, which surpassed all the preceding ones. Preparations                such  as  hotels  built  at  record  speed  and  a  choir  of  50,000                children, who sang the mass of the angels under the direction                of 600 sisters, astounded the crowds. Plenty of bishops and                cardinals participated.                      We  put  again  the  question:  what  do  the  people  see?                They see a baked wafer of flour!                      But,  God's  ardent  spirit  breathes  through  these  Eu-                charistic congresses powerfully, and raises such a feeling of                faith that attracts, prevails over, and draws. It is the triumph of                Jesus Christ as king of the world. The air itself seems to be                repeating: Jesus Christ conquers, Jesus Christ reigns, Jesus                Christ  rules!  Without  understanding  how,  everyone  knows   435                that the small consecrated wafer has only the appearance of                bread, but under that appearance there is Jesus Christ. He                passes  in  the  midst  of  the  crowds  as  he  did  in  Judea  and                Galilee.  Faith  makes  the  people  see  him  benign,  sweet,                gentle,  smiling,  and  pouring  out  graces  everywhere  with                inexhaustible  abundance!  But  those  who  see  through  his                sweetest heart, they feel his sadness for the sins of the world                and for the perdition of so many persons Who are obstinate in                sin!                      Happy  are  those  who  attend  these  Eucharistic  Con-                gresses!  However,  those  who  are  not  able  to  attend  them,                may follow the programs and the manifestations in spirit and                recollection; thus, through faith, devotion, and reception of the                sacraments they receive the same abundant graces from, the                very loving Jesus in the Holy Sacrament.                      We dare say that through the Eucharistic congresses our                Lord Jesus Christ makes the world aware of his","presence,  and  his  faith  subsists,  notwithstanding  its  in-                creasing unrest (Note to the Hymns on July first, 1926).                                      8. DAY SCHOOLS                      A great deal of good may be done to children with the                kindergarten and to young girls with the day boarding school.                The sister master will teach the young girls sewing, and cuts                of cloth, and the like, but before starting the work they all will                say  the  prayer  to  invoke  the  divine  help  and  to  direct                everything to the glory of God and to their own sanctification.                Also the work-time will be closed with a prayer.                      The  sister  will  see  that  silence  is  preserved  in  the  day                boarding  school  every  day.  When  she  needs  to  speak,  she                will  do  so  at  a  low  voice,  teaching  the  students  to  do  the                same.                      She will provide the children with half an hour of spiritual   436                reading during the work, will teach Christian doctrine to those                who  are  able  to  read  from  text-books,  and  by  words  to  the                little ones. Another sister will help her (S.D.D.Z.). (3)                      The  sisters  will  fulfill  the  aims  of  the  foundation  by                teaching  Christian  doctrine  to  the  young  girls  with  zeal  and                holy fervor. (4)                      They  will  teach  catechism  diligently,  in  support  and  in                compliance  with  the  parish  program  by  giving  appropriate                explanations and lessons of history. The sisters will inspire in                the  children's  hearts  holy  fear  of  God,  horror  of  sin,  love                toward  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  most  holy  Virgin,  St.                Joseph,  the  angels,  the  saints,  the  holy  Church,  the  Holy                Father, as well as love of their neighbor, mercy on the poor,                and fondness of holy virtues. Every day all of them will say                specific prayers and will have spiritual","reading, especially on the Passion of our Lord, with a brief                explanation. The children will be given careful attention in                their preparation for confession and Holy Communion. They                will go in group to the Sunday mass, and will be assisted in                the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and in the reception                of Holy Communion.                       To win the children's love, the sisters will be attentive of                their well being, giving special attention to those who are in                need. They will lead them in singing devout songs, in praying                for good workers to the holy Church, and in joining our pious                unions. When the children improve with the help of the Lord,                the  sisters  will  form  the  association  of  Daughters  of  Mary,                engaging  them  in  various  activities  as,  for  instance,  the                festive oratory and by taking walks outdoors (H.S.E.). (5)                      The day school, aiming at teaching femin4ne skills, must                guide  the  students  step  by  step  to  cut  cloth  and  to  sew                garments  and  to master  the  gentle  works  of  the  loom,  lace                making, and so forth. Fine arts are the splendor of the sister's   437                religious  life.  Some  of  them  should  know  music,  drawing,                painting, modeling, poetry, public speaking, and even carving                marble.  Those  inclined  to  mechanics  are  also  useful  to  the                houses.  The  sisters  skilled  in  fine  arts  may  teach  the                students.                      Education. Please accustom the students to obedience,                gratitude, mercy on the poor, gentle manners, respect for the                older,  reverence  toward  the  priests,  respect  in  the  church,                mutual  love  and  sympathy,  and  forgiveness  of  offences.                Educate them to escape from idleness, to be modest, to talk                moderately, and to bridle gluttony.                      Will  you  receive  the  students  immodestly  dressed?  If                society  were  modest,  surely  you  should  censure,  exhort,                correct, and even send them home. If society is easygoing,                however, you will do your best to repair, for instance","by  having  the  students  wear  a  scholar  uniform  provided  by                the parents. But, if immodesty is ostentatious, the young girl                must go home.                      Building.  Rooms  and  educational  facilities  must  be                maintained in hygienic conditions, ample, airy, and sunny; the                school  must  also  have  an  open  space  or  garden  for  play                activity.                      Rewards.  The  children's  work,  behavior,  kindness,  and                so forth will be recorded. The best students will be rewarded                according to their merits with personal prizes, and also with                vacation trips (S.D.D.Z.). (6)                                  9. TEACHING CATECHISM                      Teaching Christian doctrine to children is a sublime work                held  in  great  esteem  by  men  illustrious  for  science  and                holiness in all times. For instance, St. Jerome often stopped   438                his  hard  study  on  Holy  Scripture  to  catechize  children.  St.                Augustine  wrote  two  books  on  Christian  Doctrine  in  high                style.  Clement  of  Alexandria  and  Cyril  wrote  and  taught                catechisms.  St.  Gregory  the  Great  taught  children  the                elements  of  faith  personally,  the  burden  of  his  pontificate                notwithstanding.  Clement  VlIl  entrusted  the  talented                Bellarmino with writing an appropriate catechism for children.                In  France,  Gersone  taught  catechism  to  the  children  on                holidays,  and  was  praised  by  Benedict  XIV;  Bossuet  and                Fenelon took up writing minor works. In Italy, towards the end                of the 19th century, St. Alphonsus M. dei Liguori, renowned                for  holiness  and  a  doctor  of  the  Church,  wrote  a  small                catechism for children and he himself sometimes taught them                in the churches.                      Such  geniuses  esteemed  this  work  apparently  so                humble. In fact, what is the Catholic catechism all about? It is                a summery of the Christian doctrine. Considered in","its  dogmas,  Christian  doctrine  is  the best  means  to  elevate                the human intellect. Considered in its precepts, it is the most                efficacious means  to  moralize  the  heart.  It  is  not  an earthly                doctrine, but a heavenly one. It was not a man nor a prophet                nor a philosopher, but the eternal Word of God, God himself                that  revealed  it.  The  most  learned  persons  could  never                imagine  such  a  doctrine...  Made  of  mysteries,  themselves                obscure, but clear and obvious in their wording, this doctrine                reveals  where  the  person  comes  from,  who  is  the  Creator,                which  is  the  creature's  destination.  Consisting  of  principles                contrary to human passions but consistent with the needs of                the human heart, this doctrine gives peace to the people by                making  them  delight  in  the  sweetness  of  true  happiness.  It                solves  the  greatest  problems  of  human  life,  the  same                problems on which the most learned persons of Portico and                Academy struggled hard in vain; the problems which form the                absurdity  and  the  contradiction  of  the  behind  Alps'  schools,                because they unbridle reason to the most dreadful frenzies by                excluding Christ.                      Teaching catechism is a noble ministry for the doctrine   439                itself and for charity which makes such a doctrine possible.                Together with St. Paul we could say that the charity of Christ                urges us; only charity may induce the Christians to teach the                rudiments  of  faith to  uncouth  and  ragged  children,  because                such a work is humble, full of difficulties, and does not attract                selfishness  by  fostering  the  feeling  of  glory.  The  Christian                educator who spends his time in a little temple together with                poor  children  who  are  unable  to  value  his  sacrifices,  must                arm  himself  with  patience  in  order  to  teach,  and  with                meekness in order to correct. He has to continuously insist on                the easiest prayers for months and years without getting tired                of the humble, assiduous work! So much self-denial is the","daughter  of  charity.  It  is  through  charity  that  the  Christian                loves his neighbor as himself, willing to bestow the treasure                of his faith on others, to suffer and to bear everything, feeling                himself rewarded when he succeeds in making a poor child                know that there is one God who created everything.                      I know that the world displays the works of philanthropy                instead  of  the  Catholic  charitable  institutions.  But,  may  we                compare  them?  Is  it  possible  to  compare  God  with  human                beings? Philanthropy is pure love of man toward man; charity                is love of man toward God. Now then, because true love of                man is impossible without God. Philanthropy does not really                love  man,  but  pretends  to;  it  is,  therefore,  the  counterfeit                money  of  charity  in  the  hands  of  those  who,  pose  as  the                people's benefactors. The philanthropic institutions which are                supported by a false principle of beneficence or by pride, are                unfruitful and flail very quickly, because they are not based on                virtue.  On  the  contrary,  the  charitable  institutions  supported                by sacrifice and self-denial overcome any difficulty, are very                fruitful, defy time, and face fortunes.                                                                          440                     If we look at the aims of philanthropy and charity, what                unfathomable differences we see between them! Philanthropy                aims at the. natural good, which becomes unattainable when                it  is  separated  from  the  supernatural  one.  Charity  instead                aims at a divine goal: at forming a human being worth of his                fate, which implies the good a human being is able to reach in                the physical intellectual, and moral sphere.                      You easily perceive that teaching catechism to children                is a sublime work both for its reason and aim. The aim is the                eternal salvation of the souls, which brought about the eternal                Word of God to become a man, to work","and to suffer so much. By teaching children the doctrine that                educates them to avoid evil and to do good, we give them the                means for their sanctification and eternal salvation. Can you                show me an aim nobler or more important than this?                  a) Advantages                      After considering how excellent this work is, we consider                its advantages.                      Is  the  Catholic  catechism's  content  an  unfruitful,                ineffective doctrine, barren of results, or is it a doctrine fecund                of immense effects and rich with supreme advantages?                      Look  at  Christianity's  story to  find  the  answer.  You  will                see  that  this  powerful  doctrine  overcame  the  most                tremendous difficulties through its apparently weak means. It                was so fecund of results as to reform entire nations quickly.                The  apostles  preached  ,it  from  the  threshold  of  the                supper-room, and thousands of Jews were converted. They   441                preached it in Thrace and in Scythia, and the untamed people                were converted. They preached it in India, Ethiopia, Armenia,                and regenerated the people to a new life. They preached it in                Rome in the presence of the emperors like Nero, and in spite                of being persecuted, silenced, and banished in various ways                this  doctrine  overcame  persecutions,  prevailed  over  the                tyrants, and exposed the sham of the false gods, raising the                cross  of  the  divine  teacher on  their  ruins.  Isn't  this  doctrine                bringing peace in the families by opening the afflicted heart to                hope,  by  defending  the  rights  of  the  poor,  by  freeing  the                oppressed  from  'barbarity,  by  breaking  the  blocks  to  the                prisoners? Even though unknown to so many persons of the                world, this doctrine helps everyone, even those who do not                know it! Since it has been taught by the Creator of all things,                this doctrine is by itself fecund.","This  doctrine  has  never  lost  its  divine  efficacy.  Con-                tinuing through the centuries its great apostolate, the Church                never stops preaching Christ from generation to generation,                also teaching the children about God and his Church through                the Catholic catechism.                  b) Sure advantages                      Teaching  Catholic  catechism  to  children  brings  about                certain  advantages  like  the  sowing  of  the  seed  in  a  fertile                soil.  To  learn  and  profit  by  it,  however,  it  is  indispensable                that  the  pupil  have  docility  in  receiving  the  lesson  and                intelligence to understand it.                      Docility.  Owing  to  his  pure  heart  which  does  not  know                malice, duplicity and doubts, the child's docility is great. We                can  tell  you  with  how  much  certainty  children  receive  even                our mysterious teaching, the one which is unintelligible to the                human  intellect.  For  instance,  we  say  that  God  is  one  and   442                triune, that Jesus is in the Eucharist under the form of bread                and wine, that the whole Jesus is in each host, many as they                may  be;  they  object  to  nothing,  they  rather  compete  to                receive  these  truths  as  quickly  as  they  can.  Oh,  children's                divine  simplicity!  Surely,  they  deserve  the  familiarity  of  the                celestial  Father,  who  conceals  his  secrets  to  the  great  but                reveals them to children! How different instead are the hearts                of the worldly persons! Talk with them of the great mysteries                of  faith,  and  you  will  see  their  riotous  pride  and  impurity                forging  a  thousand  sophisms  in  order  to  reject  the  sublime                truths of the Christian doctrine!                      Someone  might  put  this  question:  is  a  child  so  devel-                oped as to understand what you teach?                      If you talk of the mysteries' contents, the answer is no,                because no  human  intelligence  is  able  to  understand  them;                but, if you talk of the formula through which the mysteries and                the moral truths of divine revelation are","expressed, the answer is yes, because nothing is so clear as                the Christian doctrine. God's word bestows on the people a                deep  understanding  through  simplicity  of  expression,                because  God  is  simplest  spirit,  even  though  mysterious  for                human understanding. He encloses one thousand truths in a                word  or  in  one  saying,  whereas  human  beings  use  many                circumlocutions to  express  one  idea.  This  is  the  reason  we                easily  teach  children  the  summary  of  the  mysteries,  the                philosophy of all philosophies, the code of all codes, which is                the Catholic catechism.                  c) For the individuals                      Which  are  the  certain  advantages  that  children  draw                from the teaching of Christian doctrine? We aim at teaching                and educating children, whose advantages are learning and                education. But the learning I am talking about is different from                the one of the world. The mundane person considers us as                ignorant,  because  he  knows  the  secrets  of  electricity  and                steam;  he  considers  us  reactionary,  but  himself  civilized,   443                because he has set his mind at rest through duel standards.                Talking  about  evangelical  learning  and  Christian  .education                through  which  we  teach  children  their  duties  toward  God,                neighbor,  and  themselves,  we  educate  them  to  forgive                insults,  to  obey  their  elders,  and  to  bear  with  each  other                mutually.  In  short:  we  teach  the  fear  of  God,  which  is  the                beginning of wisdom.                      Compared with one of our children, what are the French                encyclopedists  or  the  modern  rationalists  or  even  the                philosophers of old, the wise men of Greece, and the learned                scholars  of  Rome?  When  Jesus  entered  the  temple  of                Jerusalem  and  met  the  doctors  of  the  law,  he  was  twelve,                shared the discussion, and prevailed over them. A child who                knows  the  Christian  doctrine  would  do  the  same  with  the                worldly wise. He could resolve doubts","with  a  word!  He  could  correct  errors,  solve  difficulties,  and                confute  opinions!  They  should  conclude  by  saying:  we  are                ignorant; this child is wise!                      Such  is  the  teaching  and  the  education  we  give  the                children through the Catholic catechism. But we make it more                efficacious by combining doctrine with practice, by making the                children to learn the gospel and to practice it. In the evening                school  of  the  Christian  doctrine  we  settle  their  quarrels,  we                correct  their  defects,  we  guide  them  in  the  way  of  honesty                through  counsels  and  exhortations,  instilling  a  horror  of  sin                and a love of virtue; we accustom them to pray to Jesus and                Mary,  to  thank  God  for  his  mercies,  and  to  praise  him  by                singing devout songs. They begin approaching the sacrament                of  reconciliation  in  order  to  approach  the  Eucharistic  table                and  to  feed  on  the  bread  of  the  angels.  Instructed  and                educated,  they  become  honest  citizens,  industrious  workers                who  will  not  curse  their  condition,  nor  covet  the  goods  of                others  through  destruction  and  robbery.  They  will  form  the                Catholic  people  who  will  maintain  their  faith  even  in  the                presence of the seduction and the allurement, through which   444                the mundane persons dupe the crowds to achieve their own                personal aim.                      It is true that some of the students who attend Christian                doctrine  sometimes  abandon  its  celestial  wisdom.  However,                to  call  back  a  person  on  the  right  path,  nothing  is  more                efficacious  than  his  Christian  childhood's  memories.  What                inexpressible memories! Recollection of past happiness is so                dear to the persons that they feel being born again because                of it! A person living far from God is unable to be in peace; he                becomes afflicted, restless, troubled by remorses. But happy                is he if the recollection of his childhood, nurtured by the word                of God, will catch him. He will remember the time when he                with other children","learned Hail Mary, when he listened to the speech on Jesus                Christ crucified, when he burst with joy at the sight of sacred                figures, when... Oh, human heart is so natured that it lives as                much on memories as it lives on hope! Just as the prodigal                son in -his misfortune called to mind the bread he had eaten                in the house of his father for so long, thus this person who is                misled,  tossed,  and  afflicted  by  his  own  passions  will  think                over the divine food he enjoyed in the house of God, and will                say: «I will get up and go to my Father » (Lk. 15, 18)!                  d) For society                      Teaching  Christian  doctrine  to  children  brings  about                universal advantages to the individuals, to the families, and to                society.                      Unfortunately, the world mocker has fed the population                with fateful allurements and bitter disappointments, masking                its  aims  under  fine  sentences  and  passwords!  The  world                dares to tempt the people, which is so religious by nature, to   445                be irreligious, and it succeeds sometimes! But, what happens                when it succeeds? By taking away religion from the families,                everything is taken away because religion remedies even the                want  of  basic  needs,  faith  is  also  bread  giving  life  and                perseverance  in  work,  patience  in  misfortunes,  order  and                thrift in the administration of the daily salary.                      By teaching Christian doctrine we reverse what the world                does: we help the families to be religious. By instructing and                educating their children, we win their trust. They look at the                Catholic priest as at the real minister of the Lord, recommend                their  children  to  him,  respect  and  revere  him  because  they                know  that  he  is  moved  by  charity  in  such  a  humble,  but                important  work.  The  families  send  us  their  children  that  are                vivacious  and  restless,  and  take  them  home  docile  and                obedient. The mothers themselves","say  that  their  children  become  always  more  docile,  re-                spectful,,  devout,  and  diligent  at  work  when  they  frequently                attend the Christian doctrine.                      The  advantages  of  teaching  Christian  doctrine  go  from                the families to society, which cannot reach perfection without                religion. Religious and sociable persons emerge only from the                Catholic  catechism  school,  where  the  new  generation  is                trained to live in a Christian manner. There, so many children                gather  in  one  agreement;  they  feed  on  the  same  wisdom,                accustom  themselves  to  pray  together,  to  be  religious  and                devout, and to look at themselves as at the Christian society                protected  by  the  Catholic  priesthood,  receiving  the  most                beneficial, ineffaceable impressions.                      When children mature and meet again in their activities,                they  will  recognize  themselves  as  brothers  and  sisters  in                Jesus  Christ,  because  they  learned  the  same  celestial                wisdom. As a matter of fact, didn't they learn the social rules                at the same school? There, children are not told that property                is  a  theft;  on  the  contrary,  they  are  told  that  they  must  not   446                steal, nor covet the property of others; they are not told that                equality may be reached by destroying the hierarchy; they are                not  taught  how  to  throw  down  the  government  and  how  to                escape from any authority; on the contrary, they are told to                give  back  to  Caesar  what  belongs  to  Caesar,  and  to  God                what  belongs  to  God.  In  short,  we  avoid  forming  human                beings who are contrary to any real society, because we aim                at forming persons who will comply with their duty by obeying                divine and human law.                      Please  consider  how  the  advantages  coming  from                teaching  Christian  doctrine  go  from  individuals  to  families,                from families to society, and from generation to generation.","Look  at  those  children  who  will  become  fathers  and                mothers in the near future. They, the new parents, will cope                with  their  children  as  we  have  done  with  them.  They  will                educate  their  children  with  the  same  rules  of  the  Catholic                catechism. They will perhaps see on their grandchildren the                beneficial fruits of the divine teaching they have received at                our school; and when helped by the Catholic priesthood that                watched over their childhood, they will close their eyes to this                world,  they  will  leave  the  sublime  inheritance  of  faith  to  the                new generations.                      Thus, that Hail Mary, that Our Father, that small Catholic                catechism  we  teach  to  children  becomes  the  real  mustard                seed which is planted in the pure hearts, which is fostered by                the  grace  of  the  divine  farmer,  which  develops,  grows,  and                becomes a  marvelous  tree  (From  the  speech  for  catechism                reward, Feb. 5, 1878).                                   10. FOREIGN MISSIONS                      447                        I have started the evening missions in the refectory by                explaining to the communities the importance of helping the                work of the foreign missions both by prayer and means. We                need  to  introduce  this  spirit  of  zeal  in  our  communities,                because  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  may  want  a  group  of                Rogationists  and  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  to  go  to  foreign                missions  in  the  future!  Please  read  to  the  community  the                mission  pamphlets'  that  I  will  mail  to  you  and  to  the                Rogationists (Letter to the Mother Superior Nazzarena, May                25, 1921).                      Nurture the holy ideal of foreign missions in the infidels'                lands  such  as  Africa,  China,  Americas,  Oceania,  Indies,                Russia, etc. Foster the hope of gathering and educating the                Holy Childhood and the savage children in order to practice                the works of charity, instruction, and","civilization; to make Jesus known and loved by the infidels;                and to set the slaves free.                      Only the mission enthusiasts who are firmly resolved to                face  travels,  inconveniences,  want, and  perils;  who  feel  the                divine  impulse  to  bear  witness  of  their  love  toward  Jesus                through martyrdom will be appointed to such an apostolate.                      May  Jesus  our  supreme  goodness  raise  such  souls                among  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  and  may  these  gen-                erous  souls  shed  their  blood  for  the  propagation  of  the                Catholic faith, for the eternal salvation of the souls and for the                love of Jesus, who shed his Most Precious Blood for us!                     From heaven, these elect souls would be the institute's                pillars  and  the  burning  fire  of  charity  and  zeal  for  the                Daughters of Divine Zeal on earth (S.D.D.Z.).                 a) Holy Childhood                      I am mailing these pamphlets of the great, tender Holy                Childhood to you, who are concerned with holy things and are   448                increasing  your  desires  for  winning  souls  to  Jesus  Christ!                That  so  many  children  in  the  savages  and  infidels'  lands                perish  in  the  streets,  or  at  the  foot  of  the  trees,  or  are                drowned in the rivers by their cruel parents; that their souls                fall into Limbo instead of going to heaven, never seeing God,                make us cry with emotion!                      But, that hundreds of thousands of souls go straight to                heaven  when  the  Catholic  world  takes  interest  in  them  by                giving  generous  alms  to  the  missionaries  fills  our  soul  with                joy.  They  spread  the  light  of  faith  among  the  cruel,                superstitious  crowds,  make  them  know  Jesus  Christ,  make                the  parents  be  kind  with  their  children,  baptize  the  dying,                snatch  them  even  from  the  mouth  of  the  dogs  or  pigs,  and                open  for  them  the  doors  of  the  eternal  glory  through  the                redemptive baptismal water! Who knows how","the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  is  delighted  by  so  celestial                gains? These souls from heaven will repay with their prayer                the  heroic  missionaries,  the  priests,  the  catechists,  the                sisters, and the helpers.                      We  are  giving  our  spiritual  contribution  through  the                Rogation  by  winning  the  workers  for  the  rich  harvest  of  the                mystical barns and for the eternal kingdom! But for the sake                of divine mercy we are also obliged to pledge our monetary                contributions  for  such  a  holy, marvelous  work!  Isn't  this  the                best use of the means that St. Anthony lavishes on us? Isn't                this the best way to please him? The name of Holy Childhood                is due to the holiness of the work and to its dedication to the                child  Jesus,  the  most  tender  love  of  the  hearts  which  are                created to love God, not earthly foolishness! Holy Childhood                is  entrusted  to  the  child  God!  Please  imagine  how  St.                Anthony and the child Jesus are pleased by our contributions                for  the  saviors  of  so  many  souls  that  are  redeemed  by  the                Most Precious Blood. I am not saying that one of those souls                is  more  worthy  than  the  cosmos  with  all  its  marvels;  I  am                saying that one of those souls is worth as much as all souls   449                together are worthy, is worthy as much as the adorable blood                of Jesus Christ is worthy; that the entrance of one of those                souls into heaven cheers the whole paradise, the angels, the                saints, and, the most holy Virgin who meet and consign that                soul to the most holy Trinity!                      Oh,  infinite  mysteries  of  love  revealed  by  faith!  Those                little  souls  never  offended  God,  never  shared  human                foolishness, but were created to be saved by the elects who                had to practice faith, charity, zeal, and other virtues for their                own salvation!                      Was our adorable God bound to create us in conditions                so different from those of the children who are born of savage                ,parents in corrupted regions? We are born","instead  in  the  holy  Church's  womb,  we  are  baptized,                instructed in the holy religion, guided to the holy altars. We                are called to the religious life, to the divine service. We are                supported by so many celestial means for our sanctification!                And  yet,  we  have  to  love  all  souls  as  much  as  ours                concerning ourselves with them as with ours. Cod wants it!                     I am writing these lines to all communities, beginning with                you who are the chosen seed, (7) our hope, and the favorite                of Jesus' Heart; (I would say, of my bad heart too)!                     I am not urging you to contribute to this holy work through                alms. If you could, you would with great pleasure. I am more                concerned with fostering charity and zeal for winning souls to                Jesus,  because  if  you  were  apathetic,  you  were  not                Rogationists of Jesus' Heart nor Daughters of Divine Zeal...                     To  associate  you  in  this  tender,  beautiful,  touching                institution, I mail the Holy Childhood's pamphlets to you. You                can read all or the best of them as a spiritual reading or in the                refectory. You will find in my mail figures of the child Jesus   450                with children of those lands, and many more. I will see to it                that  the  Holy  Childhood's  pamphlets  be  delivered  to  you                every  month.  I  bless  you.  Let  us  belong  totally  to  Jesus                together  with  your  beloved  director,  Canon  Vitale,  and  me,                who long for so great a fortune (Letter, March 15, 1922).                  b) Preparation to the missions                     If the Daughters of Divine Zeal long for the holy missions,                they must have the pure intention of winning souls to our Lord                Jesus Christ and of  favoring the popes, who earnestly care                the increasing of the missionaries. The sisters will never long                the mission for spiritual pride.                     Were the sisters drawn to the missions by stimulus","of ambition and novelty, they wouldn't be able to resist and to                comply  with  so  high  a  work  of  charity  and  zeal  for  lack  of                grace,  they  would  instead  slacken,  jeopardizing  their                perseverance  in  time  of  persecutions.  It  is  necessary,                therefore, that those who long for the holy missions pray to                the Lord for enlightenment, for fervor, and for pure intention,                seeking the glory of God and the good of souls.                      After  praying,  they  will  submit  their  intention  to  the                superiors.  The  mother  general  together  with  her  assistants                will  pray  and  examine  the  request.  When  the  missionary                candidate's qualities such as: good nature, character, health,                and  age  give  assurances  for  the  holy  missions,  the  mother                general will accept the request, and will assign the sister to                the missionary house for an appropriate preparation.                      When  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  institute  is  formed                and holy vocations for missions are ready with God's help, a                Missionary  House  will  be  formed.  The  candidates  for  the                missions  will  prepare  themselves  for  the  task  they  will                undertake  with  the  Lord's  help,  and  with  holy  obedience  to   451                ecclesiastical  authority  and  their  own  superiors.  They  will                observe the following topics:                      1. They will attend to assiduous prayer.                     2. They will say specific prayers.                     3.  They  will  practice  penance  and  austerity  in  food,                schedule,  and  sleep,  sleeping  even  on  the  straw  or  on  the                ground and making nightly vigils.                     4. They will catechize children with great zeal and love.                As good catechists, they will teach the formulas, will explain                them,  and  will  narrate  some  stories  from  the  Bible  or  from                illustrated  catechisms,  training  themselves  accurately  in  the                missionary house.                     5. They will acquaint themselves with the mission","lands, specifically with the lands where they will go such as:                Africa, China, America, Indies, etc.                     6. Besides French, teachers and polyglot books will help                them  learn  the  language  of  the  people  among  whom  they                have to work.                     7.  To  foster  the  missionary  spirit,  they  will  read  books                and magazines from holy missions.                     8. They will be acquainted with hygiene, medicine, and                pharmacy. Same sisters should also be graduated, because                they have to cure the infidels in the missions.                     9. The mother superiors will provide the candidates for                the Missions with special lectures.                      Their training will last two or three years to be ready for                the new life of sacrifice and apostolate. The missionary house                will  be  in  a  place  where  spiritual  and  intellectual  help  is                available.  If  the  institute  has  no  house  for  this  training,  the                candidates  for  the  holy  missions  will  train  themselves  in  a                separated section of the institute (S.D.D.Z.).                                                                           452                                          NOTES                     (1)  When the Padre was writing, the Rogationists did not exist.                    (2)  Let us call  to  mind  one of our  padre's  genial  inventions. He                wanted  all  the  communities  to  spiritually  share  in  the  Eucharistic                Congress'   closing,  which  was   celebrated   in   Lourdes   in   1914.                We quote   from   his   circular   of   July   22,   1914.   After   prescribing                a Eucharistic   procession,   he   added:   «In   the   solemn   procession                of Lourdes on 26 instant,  many sick from  various cities  of the world will                greet  the  most  Holy  Sacrament  from  t  both  sides  of  the  street,                exclaiming  aloud:  O  Lord  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament,  have  mercy  on                us,  please  heal  us,  heal    us!  Probably,  sudden  healings  may  happen                during  the procession  as  it  happened  in  the   past;  thus,   our  Lord                will renew the miraculous healings he worked in Jerusalem and the cities                of Judea...","Well, we all are sick in the soul more than in the body. We have to                long  for  healing  the  spiritual  more  than  the  bodily  sickness.  For  that                reason, several persons will place themselves on the right and the left                side  of  the  places  through  which  the  Holy  Sacrament  will  pass  in                procession in our houses. One will represent the Pious Institute of Jesus'                Heart's interests, and will say: Lord Jesus in the Sacrament, have mercy                on  me,  please  heal  me,  heal  me!  Two  persons  will  represent  our                Anthonian  orphanages  for  boys,  and.  will  say:  Lord  Jesus  in  the                Sacrament, have mercy on us, please heal, heal, heal us.. Two persons                will represent the male religious communities, and will say: Lord Jesus in                the Sacrament, have mercy on us, please heal, heal us! One person will                represent  the  poor,  and  will  say:  Lord  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament,  have                mercy  on  us,  please  heal,  heal  us.  Another  person  will  represent  the                absent people who are willing to be represented, and will cry in the same                way. Then, all the people going in procession will cry: Lord Jesus in the                Sacrament, have mercy on us, 'please heal, heal us.                    In the day schools, some of the students standing on the right and                left side, will represent their fellows and will exclaim as above when the                procession is passing through.                    These invocations will be spoken now and then with raised hands,                in a loud, plaintive voice during the procession, beginning from the time                it starts. The two rows of the representatives will face each other so that                the Holy Sacrament will pass through, without interference of the general                public.                                                   453                    Each representative may wear a badge with the name of those who                are  represented  such  as  Pious  Institute  or  Anthonian  Orphanages  or                Religious Community of the Rogationists.                    If  the  procession  is  public,  nothing  hinders  this  devout,  effective                practice from being done. Done with faith, humility and love, it will obtain                spiritual healing from Jesus in the Sacrament!»                    (3)  «Please  celebrate  together  with  the   children   the  following                devotions:    the  most  holy  name  of  Jesus  in  January,  St.  Joseph    in                March, the most holy Virgin in May, the Sacred Heart of Jesus in June,                our Lady  of the  Rosary  in  October,   all  souls  in  November. The                spiritual reading from the best booklets, which will be submitted to  the                superiors,  will  help you»   (S.D.D.Z.).                    (4)  He   is talking  of  the  house  in  St.  Eufemia  of  Aspromonte.                    (5)   «The sisters running the day schools have to  prepare the girls                for the first Communion with diligent care. They will  instruct the students                about  this  most admirable Sacrament of  the Eucharist, explaining  and                making them learn by heart what the catechism says about  it.   If  you                have    gifted    students,    they      should      be      told      about  the    Old                Testament's  symbols  concerning  the   most  holy   Eucharist, such as                the  tree of life in  Eden,  the  manna,  the  bread of  Elijah,","and everything we find in the sacred history. They should be told                about the chief points of the Old and New Testament. Later, the sisters                will explain the multiplication of the bread by Jesus as a symbol of the                Eucharist,  and  the  promises Jesus made  in John, chapter  VI. At last,                they will narrate the Eucharist's institution on Holy Thursday night, at the                supper.  It  takes  months  to  prepare  the  children  this  way.  By  reading                some  chapter  of  Practice  to  love  Jesus  Christ  by  St.  Alphonsus  de'                Liguori, the sisters will excite in the children the wish to receive Jesus in                the Eucharist. During the preparation, they will lead the children to say                some wish prayer to our Lord. When the time of the first Communion is                at hand, the sisters will premise some novena to our Lord, and will help                the children to offer little sacrifices such as abstaining from drinking or                fruits or cookies.                    On the day of the first Communion, the children will be disposed in                the church under the careful attention of the sisters, who will appear so                cheered by the holy liturgy as to impress, edify, and foster in the children                the  wish  to  receive Jesus  in  the  Eucharist.»  After speaking  about  the                preparation and  the  thanksgiving,  our  padre  adds:  «  1)  It is  helpful  to                have the day school students in the institute for a three day preparation                for Holy Communion. 2) The sisters will find ways to make the children                always  remember  their  first  Communion.  3)  They  will  accustom  the                children  to  receive  Holy  Communion  once  a  week  with  the  same                devotion,  recollection,  and  fervor  they  had  in  their  first  Communion;                preparation  and  thanksgiving  will  be  given  special  attention.  4)  When   454                following the confessor's counsel fervent children wish to receive  Holy                Communion more often, the sisters will assist them to receive Jesus with                increasing  fervor  and devotion.  If children  are deprived of  this  special                attention, it is better for them to receive the Eucharist every Sunday and                chief  feasts  after  a  good  preparation,  making  an  appropriate                thanksgiving as well» (S.D.D.Z.).                    (6)  Remunerate the work. « The sisters will remember and practice                the following suggestion. To keep the day school blooming in number,                care,  and  profit,   the  sisters  must  install  remunerating  works  such                as selling embroidery and  the   like.  Practically,  the  sisters  will  pay                the  young  girls half of the sale  income, every  month»   (S.D.D.Z).                    (7)  The  letter is addressed to the  Rogationist clerics.","CHAPTER XXIII                     SACRED HEART-PASSION-INTIMATE SORROWS                     To  increase  our  zeal  for  the  divine  glory  and  the                salvation  of  souls,  to  foster  the  understanding  of  our                mission and carry It out perfectly, our constitutions urge                us  to  a  particular  devotion  to  the  most  holy  Heart  of                Jesus and to the mediation on his mysteries of love and                suffering, especially on his intimate sorrows.                    I declare that the outstanding devotion of the order                to the most holy Heart of Jesus is very sweet, gentle, and                dear to me. I consecrate myself to the adorable Heart and                to its most holy desires, wishing to promote its interests                as though they were mine. I will glory in offering myself                as  a  lover,  son,  slave,  and  victim  of  this  divine  Heart,                striving  to  make  people  know  and  love  it  all  over  the                world. But it is in the Eucharistic Communion that I will                be so close to it as to never be separated from it. I will                say: « Jesus is mine and I belong to him; I have caught                him to never loose him. » My duty is to live the life of his   455                Heart.                    For that reason I will meditate every day on the mys-                teries  of  his  life,  Passion,  death,  and  above  all  on  the                intimate sorrows of the most holy Heart, prolonging the                meditation when I am able to. Considering his profound,                hidden torments from the time of his incarnation for all                sins, for human ingratitude, the failure of elect souls, and                for  the  eternal  loss  of  many  souls,  I  will  search                thoroughly    the   most    holy    Heart   of   Jesus'                Incommensurable  sorrows,  which  surpass  those  of  his                most  holy  humanity  beyond  any  description,  but  are                meditated upon by a few people. As for myself, I will feel                the  divine  Redeemer's  sorrows  in  my  heart  and  will                contemplate  Jesus  in  the  garden  of  Gethsemane,  as  I                was deeply sharing in his agony.                     Because  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary  is  the  only  one                who penetrated,  knew,  and  shared the  sorrows  and  the                agony","of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  I  will  unite  the  meditation  on                the Intimate sorrows of the most holy Heart of Jesus with                the meditation on the Intimate sorrows of the Immaculate                Heart of Mary.                      These meditations will give me courage and strength                for  any  sacrifice,  for  the  greatest  glory  of  God,  for  the                good of all souls, and for the infinite consolation of the                most holy Heart of Jesus.                                   1. THE SACRED HEART                      From  the  beginning  to  the  end,  the  rules  of  this  pious                institute  demand  that  the  sisters  perform  everything  for  a                greater consolation of Jesus' Heart. Amen (Oct. 6, 1897).                      The divine Heart is everything for us: we, the foundation,                our  poor  work,  the  intentions,  the  houses,  the  orphanages,                and the schools are consecrated and belong to it. (1) For that   456                reason the novena and the feast of the Sacred Heart are of                primary  importance  to  us,  and  we  warmly  recommend  our                communities  to  celebrate  them  with  a  particular  affection,                devotion, and transport of love (Letter, May 13, 1913).                      Rogationists  of  Jesus'  Heart!  I  have  meditated  on  the                beauty of this name: it means prayer and action. Action also                includes  the  personal  financial  cooperation  to  continue  our                work. The specification « of Jesus Heart » crowns everything!                      This title will form our decorum, our ambition, our honor,                and the rule of our duties. It makes our devotion to the Heart                of Jesus very tender, lovable, and delightful; that Heart which                holds the fortunes of our institute and disposes of them as he                desires.                      Let  us  consider  the  divine  Heart's  actions  and  opera-                tions, what Jesus did and said during his life, and what","he  is  doing  in  the  Holy  Sacrament.  When  we  say  Heart  of                Jesus  we mean  infinite goodness,  love,  charity,  and  mercy.                Our divine Redeemer is love. Out of love he allowed himself                to  be  formed  in  Mary's  womb  like  one  of  us  with  a  human                nature.  Out  of  love  he  cried  in  the  manger,  and  drew  to                himself the hearts of mankind. Out of love he spoke, prayed,                hid himself, and worked miracles. In his Passion, out of love                'he  allowed  people  to  put  him  in  the  press, oppressing  and                transforming  him  into  the  man  of  suffering.  At  last,  the                crucified Jesus is the invincible proof of God's love for man.                      As long as we look at Jesus being formed in his mother's                womb,  in  the  manger,  in  his  hidden  life,  in  his  Passion,  or                while  performing  miracles,  we  look  at  the  external                manifestations  of  his  love.  This,  however,  is  not  the  best                contemplation. The best contemplation is searching the most                holy humanity of Jesus, discovering his Heart, because it is in                his Heart that we find his whole love.                      In the love of Jesus' Heart we find the characteristics of                true  love.  True  love  is  strong,  stands  up  against  obstacles.   457                Love  is  strong  as  death;  love  is  never  jealous...  rude  or                selfish; love is patient and kind; love is endless. The love of                Jesus' Heart is strong in his poverty and in his Passion, and                always magnanimous. Even though Jesus does not need us,                he faithfully helps us in everything, and when we offend him,                he waits for us.                            2. CONSECRATION TO THE SACRED HEART                      O most charitable Heart of Jesus, we wish you to reign                in this pious institute with your virtues, love, and glory for the                safety of the souls. Dispose of us and of our things as you                like; see to it that we work for your","most holy aims, but never for our Limited, earthly                designs. Strengthen us in your holy fear and love so that                we may prefer dying a thousand times rather than                offending you with even the least deliberate fault. Please                give us the flames of your divine charity and zeal so that                these communities may become hearths enflamed with                holy fervor, with works and with continuous prayers far                your Sacred Heart's interests as well as for winning                numerous evangelical workers to the holy Church.                Please place this institute along with its members in your                most sacred wounds. Infuse your life and your spirit in                us: life and spirit of true humility, love, affection, celestial                wisdom, divine zeal, and untiring industry for your glory                and for the salvation of the souls, for a greater                consolation of your Heart, o Jesus!

A SYMBOLICAL PAINTING                                                                          458                     Wishing to put in action an idea of mine (3) in order to                attract a greater protection of the adorable Heart of Jesus on                our  institute,  I  have  entrusted  an  artist  of  Toronto  (4)  with                painting a picture, size cm. 178 x 126, whose photos I am                mailing  to  each  of  our  houses.  The  original  painting  has                been  allotted  to  the  mother-house,  the  Holy  Spirit,  in                Messing.                       In the photo, the Blessed Margaret Alacoque is kneeling                on the altar's steps holding in her hands a little picture of the                Sacred Heart with our divine motto: « Pray, therefore, to the                owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather                in  his  harvest.  »  The  Blessed  Margaret  is  giving  a  new                message  to  the  Catholic  world  by  inviting  the  Visitation                Daughters to contemplate the Sacred Heart in the painting.                On the other side of the picture the Daughters of Divine Zeal                are kneeling, wearing","the Heart of Jesus with the Rogate on their chest. The seven                Visitation Daughters represent the seven novices whom the                Blessed Margaret inspired with fervor in the  devotion to the                adorable Heart of Jesus. Now, this devotion is spread in the                Church. On the other side of the painting seven Daughters of                Divine Zeal represent their order which shares the love and                the worship toward the most holy Heart of Jesus. Thus, the                painting  shows  that  the  divine  Heart  of  Jesus  turned  his                lowing  attention  to  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  from  the                beginning, and received their devotion and love together with                the  love  of  the  Blessed  Margaret  and  her  Daughters.  We                think that ever since the mast loving Heart of Jesus destined                to  us  the  command  of  his  Heart's  divine  zeal,  and  com-                municated this spirit of prayer to his beloved Visitation order.                      The Holy Sacrament, whence the devotion to the Sacred                Heart came forth, and where all devotions converge, is on the                altar. The celestial Rogationist St. Francis de Sales and the                celestial  Daughter  of  Divine  Zeal  St.  Joan  de  Chantal,                founders of  the  Visitation order,  kneel  before  the  most holy                Sacrament,  hinting  at  the  two  communities.  They  seem  to   459                recommend them  to  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  Imploring                for the Daughters of Divine Zeal the virtues of the Visitation                Daughters  such  as:  love  far  the  Sacred  Heart,  humility,                simplicity,  and  meekness.  They  implore  for  the  Visitation                Daughters  a  new  flame  and  the  spirit  of  zeal  for  the  divine                Heart's  greatest  interest,  which  is  enclosed  in  the  divine                saying: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest. »                      At  the  foot  of  the  Holy  Sacrament,  we  see  the  sacred                image of Immaculate Mary, who is the real Foundress of the                Visitation order and the divine mother superior of","the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  as  well  as  very  concerned                protectress of the Evangelical Rogation.                      At  the  foot  of  the  altar  also  a  priests  is  kneeling  in                adoration  before  the  Holy  Sacrament,  the  divine  Heart  of                Jesus, and Immaculate Mary. He could be the Blessed Fr. De                la  Colombiere,  an  intimate  cooperator  of  the  Blessed                Margaret  for  the  spreading  of  the  devotion  to  the  adorable                Heart. But he may represent all the Rogationists, because he                is praying to the most holy Heart of Jesus to send out good                workers to the holy Church.                      It is our hope that the present and future community of                the Daughters of Divine Zeal grow in the devotion, worship,                love,  and  zeal  for  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus,  imitate  his                divine virtues, and go deeply into zeal for the Sacred Heart of                Jesus, imitate his divine virtues, and go deeply into zeal for                the  interests  of  the  divine  Rogate.  This  consists  in                understanding  the  importance  and  efficacy  of  the  divine                prayer,  the  need  of  the  Church  for  holy  vocations  in  the                mystical harvest, and the immense utility that the numerous,   460                holy  Catholic  priests,  the  religious  orders,  and  the  mystical                workers may bring to the holy Church in the world.                      For this reason, we wish the Daughters of Divine Zeal to                make a present, future, and I would also say a past spiritual                union with the Visitation order, which is so cherished by the                sweetest Hearts of Jesus and Mary.                      To more easily reach the goal expressed by the painting,                please  frame  the  enclosed  photo  and  expose  it  where  the                community gathers comfortably, but out of the church and of                the oratory. Every Friday, or at least every first Friday of the                month, the community will say a prayer before the image of                the  Sacred  Heart,  invoking  the  Blessed  Margaret's                intercession.  We  wish  you  to  say  the  litany  of  the  Sacred                Heart and one Our Father, Hail","Mary,  Glory,  and  Hail,  holy  Queen,  to  the most  holy  Virgin,                concluding  with  the  consecration-prayer  of  the  Blessed                Margaret  and  with  a  song.  During  the  novena  and  on  the                feast oaf the most holy Heart of Jesus other prayers will be                added. On Friday, one Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory will                be added for the glorification of the Blessed Margaret. (5)                      I  have  in  mind  to  mail  the  photo  and  the  above                declaration to Paray-le-Monial Visitation convent and to some                other  communities  of  the  same  order,  asking  them  for                affiliation.                      By so doing and by striving to reach our sanctification in                perfect  union  with  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  we  expect                that our least institute will be more pleasing to his sweetest                Heart! May no one lose holy fervor, the diligent practice of the                most elect virtues, and the loving attention to please God in                everything,  but  may  each  one  avoid  sin,  even  in  the  least,                and  promote  the  interest  of  the  divine  Heart  at  any  cost!                Please  consider  how,  despite  fights  and  obstacles,  the                adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  has  formed  and  fulfilled  you  with   461                spiritual and temporal goods; I would say that with the help of                his most holy mother, he has been carrying you in his divine                arms  as  beloved  daughters.  He  has  characterized  you  and                has  sifted  you  up  to  the  rank  of  spiritual  mothers  of  the                Catholic  priesthood  with  the  divine  Rogate,  giving  you  an                exceptional beneficial mission; at last, he has filled you with                plenty of blessings.                      How  grateful  you  must  be  and  how  faithfully  you  must                answer  the  call  of  the  divine  Heart,  you  yourselves  may                judge!  Keep  in  mind  that  if  you  humble  yourselves  for  so                many undeserved gifts and serve Jesus with an always more                increasing fidelity of love, he will prepare","greater  graces  and  favors  for  you!  Amen  (Circular,  Sep-                tember 13, 1919).                                  4. SPIRITUAL PILGRIMAGE                               TO PARAY-LE-MONIAL (6)                      June 8 (1923), Friday, after the octave of Corpus Christi,                is dedicated to the most holy Heart of Jesus. On this feast,                the Italian Pilgrimage Committee has planned a pilgrimage to                Paray-le-Monial, at the fact of the adorable Heart of Jesus.                      Many people will be fortunate to go there. But everyone                has the same opportunity to spiritually join the devout pilgrims                at  the  renowned  sanctuary,  where  our  Lord  showed  his                sweetest  Heart  to  the  Blessed  Margaret  Alacoque,  making                her an apostle of the sublime redeeming devotion. The aim of                such  a  singular  manifestation  in  modern  times  was  not  to                reach  out  to  Margaret  Alacoque  alone,  but  to  all  souls.  It                aimed at inspiring with fervor all loving souls, opening to them   462                new  light,  grace,  and  holiness;  at  cabling  sinners  to                repentance, saving them from perdition and guiding them to                eternal life. Jesus continues saying: I did not come to call the                just, but the sinners.                      Dearest  children,  we  too  will  spiritually  go  to  Paray-le-                Monial, which we have been wishing to visit for many years.                To make our pilgrimage more fervent and acceptable to the                adorable Heart of Jesus, we have planned the following:                     1.  On  May  30,  before  the  novena,  we  will  farm  a  little                procession at six in the morning. While entering the oratory                for the holy mass, we will sing the song: Pilgrims, come an...;                (7) then we say the novena and the pilgrimage prayer, as well                as one Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory","to  St.  Francis  de  Sales,  to  St.  Joan  de  Chantal,  and  to  St.                Margaret Mary;                      2.  On  June  7,  eve  of  the  feast,  besides  the  morning                procession, we will have the afternoon procession, 5 to 6;                      3. To prepare themselves for the feast, the participants                will receive the sacrament of reconciliation during the novena                and will practice special virtues and devotions.                      The aims of the pilgrimage are the following:                     1.  That  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  free  our  society                from  spiritual  and  temporal  evils  as  well  as  from  divine                punishments;                     2. That the holy Church grow in holiness and freedom;                     3. That the dissident nations return to the holy Church;                     4. To save and sanctify the Catholic nations, especially                Italy and France;                     5.  That  the  missionary  institutions  flourish  for  the                salvation of the people who do not know Jesus Christ;                     6. To dissipate the heresies and the sects which oppose   463                the holy Church and the divine truths;                     7.  For  the  Holy  Father,  for  his  freedom,  and  for  the                freedom of his successors until the end of the world; (8)                     8.  For  the  souls  in  purgatory,  especially  those  we  are                bound in duty to remember;                     9. For the clergy, that they may flourish in holiness and                knowledge;                     10.  Each  person  may  add  his  own  intention  (From  the                circular).                               5. MEDITATION ON THE PASSION                      The novices will train themselves in the practice of holy                 meditation... Without adhering strictly to a topic,","they will meditate on the mysteries to which they feel drawn,                giving  the  preference  to  God's  greatness  and  his  divine                attributes, to the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the                Holy  Sacrament.  While meditating  on  the  Passion,  they  will                pay their loving attention to the intimate, ineffable sorrows of                the Sacred Heart of Jesus (R.L.P.). (9)                      The morning meditation will be entirely on the most holy                Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. The meditation book should                be touching and illuminating as, for instance, « The School of                the Passionate Jesus » by venerable Thomas of Jesus. Do                not change the meditation book frequently; when you find that                one is effective, repeat it several times, because you will not                lose holy impressions and loving feelings by repeating. It may                happen  in  profane  readings,  but  usually  not  in  the  spiritual                ones  concerning  the  mysteries  of  our  faith.  The  more  you                read  these  books  with  devotion,  the  more  you  are                enlightened,  the  more  deeply  impressed  you  grow  in  the                knowledge of God. The mysteries of our faith are a mine of                infinite wisdom, which can be meditated upon for centuries.                                                                          464                     As for the adorable Lord Jesus Christ and his mysteries,                such  as:  the  incarnation,  Christmas,  his  divine  infancy,  his                hidden life, his public ministry, and especially his most holy                Passion and death on the cross and the most holy Eucharist,                they  form  the  infinite  abyss  about  which  the  Apostle  Paul                wrote: « How long and broad and high and deep is Christ's                love! » (Eph. 3, 18). The more the soul meditates with love,                humility,  and  purity  on  Jesus  Christ  and  his  mysteries,                especially the ineffable mystery of his Passion - even with the                same  book  and  the  same  words  -  the  more  the  soul                experiences the intimate, sorrowful, and loving impression of                our divine Savior's limitless pain and love. The mare the soul                discovers the hidden mysteries of that divine love, the more it                is","caught  (10)  by  the  wounds  of  the  most  holy  humanity  of                Jesus tortured and bleeding. In union with the divine soul and                the most loving Heart of Jesus, the faithful will expatiate in the                limitless abyss of charity that made the Son of God a man,                who  was  immolated  for  the  Father's  glory  and  for  the                salvation of souls.                      These  inevitable  results  will  be  achieved by  those  who                meditate  with  faith  and  love on  the  divine  Savior's  ineffable                suffering. Therefore, we exhort our children in Jesus Christ to                never  neglect  the  meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our  Lord,                because  it  produces  immense  fruits  to  the  souls  who  are                favorably  disposed.  The  daily,  continuous,  constant                meditation produces love for Jesus, our supreme goodness,                'hate  of  the  present,  past,  and  future  sins,  and  strengthens                one  in  holy  detachment,  desire  to  be  united  with  God,  holy                virtues, and charity toward the afflicted and the suffering. We                must always keep in mind that meditation on our Lord Jesus                Christ's Passion is a necessary, very happy condition for the                soul to approach the sacred table with compunction, fervor,                and a profitable love, because the Passion and the Eucharist   465                cannot  be  separated.  Our  Lord  said  that  the  most  holy                Eucharist  is  the  memorial  of  his  Passion  and  death.  It  is                during the mass that the sacrifice of Calvary is renewed mys-                tically, but really, and Jesus comes down from heaven at the                consecration  of  the  bread  to  feed  his  dear  souls  with  his                immaculate body and his most precious blood.                      Preparation for meditation on the most holy Passion of                our  Lord  ought  to  be  each  one's  immediate  preparation  for                Holy Communion. During the meditation the angels will clothe                the  soul  in  the  wedding  dress  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's                infinite merits to share in the great supper. The sister will be                happy, because she will not be told: « Friend, how did you get                in here without wedding","attire? Tie up hand and foot and throw her outside in the dark.                There she will cry and gnash her teeth » (Mt. 22, 13). On the                contrary,  the  divine  spouse  will  meet  her  joyfully  saying:  «                You  are  really  beautiful,  my  dear,  you  are  clothed  in  the                merits of my Passion and death: faithful daughter, enter the                glory of your Lord, because I am, in the Holy Sacrament, your                heaven on earth » (S.D.D.Z.).                                 6. THE INTIMATE SORROWS                     The meditation on the intimate sorrows of the most holy                Heart of Jesus is of a great importance far the Daughters of                Divine Zeal. During his life - the nine months in his mother's                womb included - Jesus suffered in his divine Heart an abyss                of interior sorrows so intense that he could have died at any                moment  of  pure  pain  if  his  divine  omnipotence  had  not                maintained  his  life  up  to  the  last  moment.  The  prophets                announced  beforehand  such  a  suffering  through  expressive                terms and images. The most bitter waters that flooded Jesus   466                Christ's  most  holy  soul  derived  from  several  sources.                According to the revelation granted to the Blessed Villani, the                main sources were: 1) The sight of all sins that Jesus took on                himself as if he were responsible for them in the 'eyes of his                Father's  justice.  2)  Human  ingratitude  for  his  love  and                suffering, of which the prophet David had said: « What has                the shedding of my blood gained? » 3) The sight of so many                souls who are lost eternally, which made him say through the                mouth of the prophet: « The pains of hell surrounded me! » 4)                The  fearful  sight  of  his  coming  Passion  and  death,  which                were always present in his mind through the divine vision in                such a way that he suffered them all his life. To these sorrows                that  oppressed  his  divine  Heart  other  sorrows  were  joined,                such as: the","sight  of  his  most  holy  Mother's  sorrows,  the  Queen  of                Martyrs, who was the only one able to penetrate in depth the                abyss of his intimate sorrows: the sorrows and the torments                that  the  elects  on  earth  and  in  purgatory  had  to  suffer  the                ingratitude, ruin, and dispersion of his beloved people Israel;                the  ingratitude,  obstinacy,  and  loss  of  Judas,  and  so  many                other causes which oppressed the Heart of Jesus!                      Our Lord somehow showed his divine Heart's abyss of                anguish in the garden, where he sweats drops of blood on the                ground.  He  suffered  this  inexpressible  agony  up  to  Calvary                and  his  last  breath.  This  intimate  Passion  of  Jesus'  Heart,                called  also  mental  pains  in  the  revelation  to  the  Blessed                Villani, surpasses the hardships, the pains, and the torments                that Jesus suffered in his most holy humanity.                      The loving Daughters of Divine Zeal must never neglect                the meditation on the intimate sorrows of the divine Heart of                Jesus. Each sister will go  deeply into them, will sympathize                with  the  most  loving  Heart  of  Jesus  so  suffering,  and  will                become  inflamed  with  zeal  and  fervor  to  console  him,  as   467                much  as  she  can,  through  her  own  sanctification  and  the                salvation of souls. She will be zealous to win from the most                holy  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary  elect  ministers,  apostles  of                faith and charity, holy souls in all social classes so that the                kingdom of God may be spread on the ruin of the kingdom of                sin, and the adorable Heart of Jesus may be assuaged and                infinitely consoled (S.D.D.Z.).                      The  novices  will  meditate  on  and  pray  for  a  particular                topic, which forms the special character of this humble, small                institute,  considering  it  as  a  special  gift  of  the  Lord.                Specifically, they will meditate on the Passion that the Heart                of Jesus suffered in his innermost, which is little","considered and quite unknown, but was more painful than the                Passion Jesus suffered in his most holy body. This Passion                includes the intimate, ineffable sorrows and sadness that our                divine Redeemer felt in his Heart, all his life long. Beginning                with his first heart-beat until his last one, the adorable Heart                suffered and agonized bath at the sight of all sins that he was                going  to  expiate,  and  whose  malice  and  horror  he  knew                perfectly, and at the sight of all human ingratitude and of the                eternal loss of so many souls! Going deeply into this singular,                ceaseless,  inexpressible  suffering of  the  most  holy  Heart  of                Jesus is a great gift and mercy of God, who moves the soul to                a  great  compassion,  gratitude,  and  love.  This  institute's                particular  spirit,  which  conforms  to  the  saying  of  our  Lord                Jesus Christ, « Pray, therefore, » is bound to the meditation                on the intimate sorrows of Jesus' Heart. By going deeply in                these  sorrows  the  congregants  cannot  be  apathetic  before                the interests of the divine Heart. They instead feel and share                them,  and  are  moved  to  sacrifice  themselves  for  the  divine                .interests.  The  divine  saying  resounds  to  their  ears  and                makes  them  obey  that  command  to  console  the  most  holy                Heart of Jesus in his sorrows. This prayer aims directly at the   468                greater glory of God and at the sanctification of souls in the                interests of the most holy Heart of Jesus (R.N.).                                  7. OUR LADY IN SORROW                      Daughters, behold our most holy mother full of sorrows                and anguishes. Let us stop contemplating her in the kingdom                of glory, where she is sharing the same joy of the most holy                Trinity  at  the  right  hand  of  her  divine  Son,  but  let  us                contemplate  her  in  the  kingdom  of  affliction,  where  she                shared the pains of her divine son Jesus.","She is the queen of heaven and earth as well as the queen of                martyrs. Just as she surpasses the angels and the saints in                holiness and dignity, so she surpasses the sufferers and the                martyrs in sorrows.                      With the Lord's help, in heaven we will enjoy the glory of                Jesus and Mary, seeing them face to face; but in this valley of                tears,  we  have  to  shed  our  tears  with  Jesus  and  Mary;  we                have  to  contemplate  their  suffering,  relating  to  our  Lady  in                sorrow  our  devotion  to  her  under  any  title.  In  any  image of                Mary we have to see Our Lady in sorrow! If we look at the                Virgin in sorrow, we cannot be apathetic! Please observe her                pale and pitiful face, her anguish of heart, the seven swords,                the violet cloak... she seems to say: « Daughters, sympathize                with  me,  because  I  am  the  most  afflicted  mother  »                (Preaching, Sept. 28, 1913).                                      8. THE DESOLATE                                                                          469                     « All you who pass this way, look and see. Is any sorrow                like the sorrow that afflicts me, with which Yahweh has struck                me on the day of his burning anger » (Lam. 1, 12)?                      The  holy  Church  and  the  sacred  writers  often  apply  to                Our Lady in sorrow these words that the plaintive Jeremiah                said  on  the  ruin  of  Jerusalem  conquered  and  reduced  to                extreme desolation by the enemies. The sight of the desolate                Jerusalem  was  a  pale  figure  of  the  true  Daughter  of  Zion,                Immaculate  Virgin  Mary,  in  her  incomparable  desolation  for                the death of her only son Jesus...                      The  most  august  lady  was  first  afflicted,  then  went                through desolation; for this reason we contemplate Our Lady                in sorrow and Our Lady Desolate. When Our Lady is suffering                together with her son Jesus, she shares his","pains, his bitter cup, she is in sorrow. When Jesus dies, she                becomes desolate, and the cup of her sorrows reaches the                brim, overflowing.                      My faithful, what mysteries! I see Our Lady in sorrow in                each pain of our Lord Jesus Christ. I see her in the Passion                as  plunged  into  all  pains  together  with  Jesus!  But,  in  her                desolation she suffers without Jesus! I see the wounds of her                heart  opening  again,  but  Jesus  Is  not  with  her!  I  see  her                scourged by the painful memories, but Jesus is not with her! I                see her crucified in 'her heart and mind, where the nails are                deeply driven in, but Jesus is not with her! She can cry out, «                the light of my eyes itself has left me » (Ps. 38, 10).                      This is worth our consideration! Just as in the human fall,                sin  began  with  a  woman,  so  in  the  work  of  human                redemption,  atonement  had  to  end  with  a  woman!  «  Jesus                bowed his head and died » (Jn. 19, 30). In that moment his                pain  ended:  Jesus,  the  man  of  suffering,  stopped  suffering.                But,  the  partner  of  his  suffering,  the  co-redeemer  of                humankind did not stop suffering. Rather she entered a more   470                bitter, ample, deep, stormy sea of anguishes: she entered the                endless sea of desolation!...                      The  devotion  to  the  most  holy  Mary  Desolate  is  most                moving and tender. It is an expression of the innermost, filial                affection toward the most holy Virgin Mother of God and ours.                This  devotion  consists  in  keeping  company with  the Mother                Desolate  from  the  time  the  body  of  Jesus  is  buried  until                Easter dawn, when our Lord Jesus Christ rises from the dead                and  appears  to  his  most  holy  mother.  It  is  a  period  of  36                hours. If in our human fragility we cannot keep company with                the  Mother  Desolate  for  36  hours,  at  least  let  us  keep  her                company in these very painful hours when she has lost her                divine son.                      When Martha and Magdalene lost Lazarus, many","people  went  to  them  to  sympathize.  But,  here  is  the  Virgin                Mary,  who  is  greater  than  Martha  and  Magdalene;  she has                lost  one  who  is  greater  than  Lazarus;  she  has  lost  the  one                who raised Lazarus from the grave by a word; she has lost                not a brother, but her only son, the Son of God! Let us go and                sympathize  with  her.  This  devotion  began  with  the  pious                women who remained with the desolate lady after the death                of our Lord Jesus Christ. How those spiritual daughters of the                Nazarene mourned together with the Virgin Mary! How they                were united in sharing the desolation of her motherly heart!                St. Bernard says: « They saw the pious Mother lacking any                relief,  so  they  mourned  more  for  her  than  for  the Lord  who                had died » (Preaching on the Desolate, 1904)!                                            NOTES                     (1)  Padre  Oi  Francia  consecrated  the  Institute  to  the  most  holy                Heart  of  Jesus  more  than  once.  Here  we  quote  a  passage  from  the                consecration he made in 1903:  « O most sacred Heart of Jesus... we                present the fortunes of this least institute along with its events, works,   471                tribulations,  fights,  sorrows,  distress,  success,  progress,  expectations,                hesitations,  wishes,  religious  feast, personnel,  educators  and children,                individuals, either alive or dead, spiritual and temporal beiefactors, either                alive or dead, and the people who opposed it in any way. In this solemn                moment, we also present the wishes, the works, and the hope about the                institute's future. As object of your compassion and mercy, we submit to                you our human failings along with the failings of those who shared this                pious institute.

I am at your divine will's disposal;                O my Jesus, see to it that I serve you faithfully.  Please make  me fit for   472                your divine   service by giving   me    holy virtues,    especially    humility,                obedience,  and  holy  detachment  from  terrestrial  things.  Give  me  holy                fear of you, your love,  and  a  great  wish  to sanctify myself  in  order  to                belong  to  you  totally.  O  my  Jesus,  help  me  to  be  recollected  in  your                divine presence when  I  pray. — Mother Mary,  let me  belong to Jesus                completely.                    2)   Humblest Heart,  remove the  pride  from our  hearts  and fill                them  up with  holy  humility and  affection  to  it.  O  meekest  Heart,                quench the irascibility of our heart by making us mild, serene, and calm.                Immaculate  Heart,   candor of eternal  light,  do  not  allow  our mind to                be darkened nor our  hearts to be  tarnished  by even the least sin. You                who  cherish  the  lilies,  make  us  worthy  of  our  angelical  ministry!  As                clerics, infuse in our heart the zeal for your glory and for the salvation of                souls. Let us share your zeal for God and your thirst for souls!... Jesus,                pleasure of the souls, give  us  your  holy love...   wound   our   heart!                Let   us   love   you   by   making   ourselves enamored  of you. O                beloved  Jesus,  how can we lead  the  people to know and love you. if                you do not yet enkindle in us the fire of your love? How can we  become                the light of  the world,  if you do not enkindle in us your love? How can                we be the salt of the earth,","if you do not transform us into yourself out of love?... Please give us                your love along with the most beautiful love of Immaculate Mother Mary!                Please see to it that we may live enamored of this beautiful Lady and                that your love and the love of Mary may be the only loves of our heart.

In 1923, on the occasion of the                pilgrimage to Paray-Ie-Monial organized by the Italian committee (Which                planned that the destination be reached on June 8) for the feast of the                Sacred Heart, the padre organized a spiritual one that turned out to be                one of the best. He mailed a printed circular to the houses, explaining                the  various    intentions:    adoration,  praise,    thanksgiving,  atonement,                prayer for the Church's triumph, for the salvation of the souls, for winning                good workers to the Church, for the missions, etc... spiritually they would                remain at Paray for 5 days.                    They had to spend those days honoring the Sacred Heart of Jesus                with special visits, songs,  sacrifices, etc.; from  there  they  would go to                Lourdes,  where  the  Italian  pilgrimage  went  every  year.  Much  to-  the                satisfaction  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus,  this  spiritual  journey  had   473                wonderful effects. (Fr. Mary Hannibal Di Francia — his life and works —                pages 299-300).                    In those days we had to spiritually visit the novitiate, where Jesus'                Heart had the first worshipers, the choir where the community honored                the Sacred Heart for the first time, the niche built on the novitiate's stairs,                the first little temple dedicated to the Sacred Heart in the monastery's                garden  at  the  beginning  of  1687,  and  the  human  remains  of  St.                Margaret.  Everything  was  accompanied  by  particular  prayers,  pious                practices, and spiritual reading mostly from St. Margaret's writings.                    (7)  Please hear the padre's heart's desire in these stanzas:                    No mountain,  no sea,                    No obstacle whatsoever                    Is able to flee                    The trip of our love!                    We are carried by the Heart,                    The Heart of his love.                    No hunger,  no pain,                    No thirst exhaust us.                    Our hunger is God,","Our thirst is Jesus. Take care, never stop. Hasten to Jesus!                    (8)  Remember that the Holy Father recovered freedom  through the                concordat  of  Feb.  11,  1929.  In  1923  the  concordat  seemed  to  be                impossible.                    (9)    They      will      take      care      of      three      things:      affections,                prayers,  and  resolves.  As  to  affection,  they  will    prefer  acts  of  love                towards Jesus,   offering  themselves   along  with  their  wishes  for  the                divine glory,  for  their  sanctification,  for  the  sanctification  of   souls,                and  for  everything  concerning  Jesus'  Heart's  interests.  As  for  the                prayers, they will always ask for the love for Jesus, holy perseverance,                virtues, and  help to observe the rules.  They will  pray for the  interests                of Jesus' Heart, that the owner of the harvest send out workers to his                harvest,  for  the  needs  of  the  holy    Church    and    the  ecclesiastical                superiors, for the  innocent, for the conversion of sinners,   and  for all                souls. They will pray for their sisters, the mother superior, and the pious                institute to grow in the most holy Heart of Jesus. They may also pray for                the  writer  of  these  rules.  As  to  the  resolves,  they  have  to  prepare                themselves  for  the  daily  occurrences,  promising  to  avoid  their  usual                defects  and  to  practice  the  virtues  they  need,  especially  the      exact                execution   of   their   office,   silence,   and   good   example. They must                consider how  much  God  is  pleased  by  faithfulness  in the little things!                Through prayer and firm resolve, they will accustom themselves to be                faithful»   (R.L.P.).                    (10)   See   how   our   Padre   meditates   on   the   loving   plans     474                of Jesus   in   his   Passion:    «Jesus   wanted   to   diversify   his                Passion's mystery so that you  might find every sort of nourishment in                each  of  his  torments.  If  you  do  not  surrender  to  the  first  torment,  for                instance,  to  the  agony  in  the  garden,  he  submits  his  cruel  capture  to                you.   If  you   resist,   he   takes  you   to   the   tribunal,   making   you                ponder  how  his  most  venerable,  majestic  person  was  outraged  with                blows, slaps, fists, spittle... But, if you are hard and still  resist, he shows                to you his dreadful scourging, his most delicate flesh mercilessly torn for                your sake, to win your heart. And yet, he is eternal, infinite, omnipotent                God,  the king and the Lord of heaven and earth, while you are nothing,                a pitiable small worm! To be happy for ever, did                    'he need you? But, if you will resist and do not surrender to his love,                he chooses another more terrible suffering to convince and move you to                repentance and love; such a suffering is the crowning with thorns, whose                inconceivable pains are renewed by the executioners every time they hit                the crown. The more the dreadful thorny crown is driven in the head, the                more  the  pains  become  horrible!  Which  thorn  will  pierce  your  heart?                Which  of  the  torments  that  Jesus  endured  for  you,  will  make  you                surrender?","If you did not yet surrender, Jesus will undergo new torments. He                lets  the  authority  condemn  him  to  the  capital  punishment  of  the                criminals, who are to be taken out of society to protect it. Let us suppose                that at this point your cold heart starts being touched. Your Jesus takes                courage  to  conquer  you.  He  embraces  the  cross  with  a  joyous  heart,                wearing  the  crown  of  his  love  to  really  become spouse of  blood,  and                starts going to the Calvary in the hope that you will follow him.                    To win and make you belong to him entirely, in this painful way he                undergoes  various  pains,  such  as:  falls,  meeting  with  his  most  holy                mother, the choice of the Cyrenaic, the plaintive mourning of the women                to whom he wants you to join, the stamp of his bloody, unrecognizable                face  on  Veronica's  veil,  and  the  incredible  cruelty  of  the  executioners                who  drag  him.  In  his  pains,  he  looks  at  you  through  the  centuries;                because  you  are  weak  in  loving  him,  he  calls  you  to  watch  the  last                terrifying event of his life: the crucifixion and the three hours of agony.                He assails your heart to win it to his love. His wounds are arrows, his                adorable blood a besieging fire, his divine words thunder apt to shake                the mountains, his dying looks that watch you through the centuries are                lightnings even on the darkness of hell; the least motions and the painful                contractions  of  his  most  holy  members  on  the  cross  are  most  loving                calls; the giving of his most holy mother to you as your mother and his                saying « I am thirsty,» are stratagems to win you; the abandonment by                all, even by his eternal Father, aims at touching you in order to surrender                to  his  love  completely,  to  leave  worldly  matters,  your  will,  and  your   475                judgment that oppose his pure love. It also aims at making you abandon                yourself  to  his  adorable  will.  This  is  the  last  stroke  at  your  heart's                hardness.                    At the end, he cried out: «It is finished!» This cry has two meanings                for you.                    To much satisfaction of his Heart, by crying < it is finished» Jesus                could mean: I have won my beloved's heart; I have guided her through                the  incredible  pains  that  I  have  conceived  and  chosen  to  make  her                surrender,  which  she  did  by  leaving  everything,  even  herself;  she                repressed her passions by washing herself in my blood; she is mine for                ever.                    God forbid that by crying «it is finished * Jesus might have meant: I                have done all I could to win her to my love, I have undergone incredibile                pains  to  win  her,  but  she  resisted  me  until  the  end!  She  seemed  to                surrender in the presence of new pains and of the sweetest voice of my                loving, suffering heart, but she did not. She followed her passions, the                world, and my enemy's cheating voice. I have nothing more to do. « It is                finished!»                    And yet, as though Jesus wanted to make his last effort to win your                unfaithfulness and hardness, he almost gathers all his","pains. Passion and death; he gathers his loving stratagems to give                you the finishing blow. While the sky is darkening, the earth is trembling,                the  nature  is  terrified,  mourning  for  your  hardness  and  unfaithfulness,                Jesus opens his most holy mouth, cries qut in a loud agonizing voice,                and makes all  the people  hear it during  the  centuries until  the  end of                time. This is the last stratagem to win you to his most loving Heart. Then                he  joins  his  cry  with  the  following  words:  «Father,  into  your  hands  I                commend my spirit!» Just as he had said: Father, my spirit of love and                charity  for  each  person,  for  the  sanctification  and  for  the  salvation  of                each soul is also for that soul (Jesus was talking of you). I put my spirit                in your divine, merciful hands so that my pains and my precious blood                may  always  invoke  mercy  on  that  hard,  unfaithful  soul.  In  my  divine                mind, I was unable to conceive a torment apt to win her to my Heart as                my  beloved  bride  and  Daughter  of  Divine  Zeal!  Father,  through  your                divine  power  see  to  it  that  my  suffering  and  blood,  my  Passion  and                death, my body, blood, soul, and divinity that I give her in the Eucharist                may win her completely. Father, do not stop this work, because my spirit                of eternal charity always implores mercy on this person you created, and                for whom I gave myself. My spirit cannot find rest in your hands until she                breathes her last!                    I  leave  these  considerations,  which  conform  to  the  truth  and  are                perhaps inspired by the Lord, to my beloved Daughters of Divine Zeal so                that  they  meditate  on  the  Passion  and  death  of  our  most  loving  Lord                Jesus Christ* (S.D.D.Z.).                                 476","CHAPTER XXIV                                       THE STUDY                     To help the institute and souls as much as I can in                my priestly ministry, I will love and cultivate study.                      Besides  applying  myself  to  the  study  of  moral                theology, dogma, canon law, ascetism, the mystics, and                to my favorite Holy Scripture, I will also devote myself to                sound readings such as: the holy Fathers, the saints, the                sacred  authors,  and  ecclesiastical  history,  avoiding  the                study à la moderne which lacks spirit.                     For the glory of God and the salvation of souls, I will                apply myself to study with the utmost care, aiming at pre-                paring  myself  for  the  priestly  ministry  of  confessions,                preaching, and teaching, always bearing in mind the Holy                Spirit's sayings: « knowledge puffs one up » (1 Cor. 8, 1),                and « be modest in your thinking » (Rom. 12, 3).                                                                          477                    If I happen to study profane science or letters, I will                do  it  by  holy  obedience  for  the  glory  of  God  and  the                salvation of souls, avoiding to apply myself in them with                passion lest I loose fervor or the application to the study                of the saints' wisdom and knowledge.                     If by the Lord's grace I am inclined to fine arts, I will                apply myself to them by obedience for the glory of God,                for  the  good  of  souls and  of  the  institute,  because fine                arts are gifts of the Lord, which may achieve holy aims.                We, however, will give a strict account of them to Him.","1. FOR THE PRIESTS                      The  aspirant  will  consider  study  both  as  a  means                qualifying for the priesthood, if the grace of the Lord and holy                obedience call for it, as well as a duty and a command from                the superiors; therefore, he will take the utmost care to profit                by it, because an aspirant who is slothful to study shows no                vocation for the priesthood. After invoking the Lord, the most                holy  Virgin,  and  the  guardian  angel,  the  aspirants  will                concentrate  their  attention  on  the  study  at  hand,  applying                themselves to it in perfect silence (R.A.).                      What  is  the  priesthood  all  about?  It  is  the  light  of  the                world,  the  mysterious  lantern  lit  on  the  bushel,  whence  it                gushes out flashes of light to clear away the darkness of the                earth,  pointing  the  way  to  heaven.  This  mystical  light  must                illuminate people with the rays of science and of holiness.                      As to science, we premise that the priest is a minister of                God, a distributor of his mysteries to the people, a salvation                bridge  between  heaven  and  earth,  a  mediator  between  the   478                Creator  and  the  creature;  therefore  his  science  must  be                drawn  from  the  pure  sources  of  the  truth,  from  the  eternal                principles of God, of his attributes, mysteries, and law. This                eminent science is theology. The priest must be full of it. If he                enriched his mind with other sciences but this one, he would                fail  his  mission.  He  might  be  a  scholar,  a  philosopher,  a                mathematician,  but  if  he  lacks  theology,  he  has  failed  his                sacred duty.                      Theology is a vast science about God and dogmas, as                well  as  the  application  of  divine  law  in  human  life,  and  the                worship we owe to God; hence the triple distinction between                dogmatic, moral, and canon theology. The priest is called into                this field to know God and to lead the people","to  know  and  to  worship  him  (Funeral  oration  on  Canon                Ardoino).                                     2. FOR THE SISTERS                      To  form  the  sisters  is  a  very  hard  enterprise  for  me,                because  I  imagine  the  modern  sisters  in  a  very  high  ideal!                The sister is not closed between four walls today. She is in                the midst of society to cope with a censorious, mocking, and                miscreant world. She must honor her garb with virtues such                as:  modesty,  prudence,  charity  as  well  as  with  intelligence                and knowledge (Speech, August 20, 1906). (1)                      The  sisters  will  provide  themselves  with  proper  edu-                cation,  and  some  of  them  will  acquire  the  credentials                necessary for teaching the orphans. The candidates and the                probationers  who  are  inclined  to  literature  will  attend                advanced courses upon the subject (R.L.P.). (2)                                                                          479                     We  entreat  the  mother  superiors,  and  above  all  the                mother general, to foster diversified education in each house.                The  first  education  must  be  the  religious  education  through                the continuous teaching of the little catechism, the illustrated                catechisms,  the  summary  of  dogmatic  theology,  and  the                school of sacred, ecclesiastical history.                      Such  courses  of  four  to  five  years  with  good  teachers,                mature  prudent  pious  priests,  and  a  board  of  examiners                should  be  agreed  upon  with  the  bishop.  The  sisters  would                receive the diploma at the end of the course, after appropriate                exams.                      The  advantages  of  these  courses  would  be  great,                because  the  sisters  would  teach  religion  to  many  young                women in the day schools, in the boarding schools and","in the colleges. They would also teach in our  institutes, and                the  spreading  of  their  teaching  would  create  a  special                reputation for the Daughters of Divine Zeal. Oh, how pleased                our  Lord  would  be  by  this  instruction!  If  religious  education                does not matter to the government, it matters very much to us                and to each religious community!                      The  mother  superior  will  also  foster  literary  education,                which helps the minds to open and qualify young women for                our  offices,  for  our  typographies,  and  for  administration.                Regarding  the  credentials  for  teaching,  we  need  sisters                qualified  for  the  day  and  the  boarding  elementary  schools,                and  for  the  orphans  as  well.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to                foster these courses.                      If we have smart students with the opportunity to attend                the universities, we should encourage them. They could help                other  sisters  to  obtain  teaching  credentials,  to  form  a                boarding  school  recognized  by  the  government.  Teaching                many young women would be a great good, which would help                the institution of the Daughters of Divine Zeal.          480                      Those responsible for the studies will accept wholesome                young  girls  of  twelve  years  who  show  signs  of  vocation,  to                lead them to the study. Because they are young, they shave                the potential to achieve good results (S.D.D.Z.). (3)                      The mother general, who enjoys fostering the progress                of the institute for the Lord's glory and the good of souls, will                foster the fine arts. These form virtue and the splendor of the                garb, since they raise the admiration of the world and attract                people to the good. A prophet says that the fine arts are the «                Strings of Adam » because they unite the heart to truth and to                goodness.  By  altering  the  nature  of  the  fine  arts  and  by                conforming them to human passions, the world drags souls to                vice","and  perdition;  we  instead  must use  them  to  entice  souls  to                holiness.                      With regard to the fine arts, those who are not inclined to                them  should  not  be  expected  to  apply  themselves  to  them.                Frankly,  many  people  have  natural  dispositions  to  the  fine                arts  without  realizing  it.  If  they  cultivate  those  dispositions                with  good  teachers  and  with  practice,  they  might  become                excellent artists.                      The  mother  superior  who  desires  that  the  fine  arts                bloom,  will  probe  the  particular  dispositions  of  the  young                women  by  asking  them  to  which  fine  art  they  feel  inclined,                such as: music, sculpture, painting, etc. But before granting                anyone the permission to study fine arts, the mother superior                will suggest that they pray and she herself will do the same.                      The  mother  superior  should  know  that  literary  studies                open the mind to the people, helping them to succeed in the                fine arts. Many persons fail for lack of talent and education,                their  good  disposition  notwithstanding.  So,  if  a  person  is   481                inclined  to  a  fine  art  and  applies  herself  without  having  the                necessary education, she may not achieve perfection, nor will                she become an artist. On the contrary, if a person is inclined                to  a  fine  art  and  is  also  experienced  in  grammar,  history,                mathematics or is a teacher, she will become an artist if she                applies herself to it. To help a person improve her good taste                and  be  successful  in  painting  or  in  sculpture,  etc.  let  her                contemplate the masterpieces in Florence, Rome, and other                cities.  For  this  reason  we  should  open.  a  house  in  a  city                where teachers of fine arts abound (Ibidem).                               3. A DRAWBACK TO BE AVOIDED                      I  have  observed  in  various  houses  the  world's  habit  of                displaying embroidery and the like, thus covering the","beauty  of  the  holy  objects,  instead  of  beautifying  them. For                instance: if you embroider a cross with gold by interweaving                many designs, in the end you see the designs only, not the                cross. Or if you make the corporals with large and denticulate                fringes,  they  stick  to  the  alb  sleeves  of  the  priest  and  are                drawn by the movements of the priest's hands. Or if you lace                the alb from the flank to the feet or lace the whole sleeve, you                do it against the rubrics. Or if you make the veil of the taber-                nacle with strong solid fabric embroidered in gold, it becomes                unbending,  and  the  priest  can  hardly  open  the  tabernacle.                When he succeeds in opening it, the veil presses against it                and closes the door again, making the priest feel uneasy.                      The persons who make such works feel proud of them;                they  instead  should  be  aware of  deserving blame,  because                they use the holy objects to display their own style.                      We  expressly  forbid  such  works.  The  cross  must  be                entirely  visible  in  the  embroidery;  only  some  rays  may  be                added at the four corners. The corporals must be very simple,                having no fringes at the border. The alb must have the lace a   482                span  tong,  and  the  surplice  half  a  span.  The  veil  for  the                tabernacle  must  be  thin,  flexible,  and  easy  to  roll  at  the                opening  of  the  little  door.  Fashionable  embroidery  is  only                suitable when it conforms to these rules. The corporals with                internal  embroidery  and  with  holes  are  forbidden,  because                the sacred fragments pass through and are lost (Notes for a                circular).","NOTES                     (1)    He  also  speaks  of  the  studies  introduced  at  the  Holy  Spirit                convent:  «About  30  young  aspirants  to  religious  life  from  various                towns   are   attending   various   courses,   such   as:   Italian   literature,                history,   geography,   mathematics,   and   French   language.   Since   I                consider that fine arts are the garb's splendor, we let our youths learn                drawing, painting, and music.                    (2)  Either to run our orphanages' schools or to open day schools                with our religious teachers, our students must attend regular courses in                order  to  get  the  teaching  credentials.  We  must    train    the  young                candidates  for religious  life  to  become  skilled  and  promising  for our                institute, such as those  (about  ten)  who are  in  Messina,  and provide                them   with  study  opportunities.   For  this   reason   we  would like the                superior  of  each  house  to  transfer  at  least  some  of  their  youths    to                Messina  to study»   (Circular,  January  1925).                    (3)    Here,  our  padre  is  a  forerunner;  when    he  was  writing  such                things, the seminaries for sisters did not exist.                                                                                483","484","CHAPTER XXV                               BEING HUMBLE IN SUCCESS                      While  succeeding  in  study  or  In  fine  arts  or  in                anything,  I  will  avoid  pride,  ambition,  and  selfishness,                which  make  our  work  appear  to  us  a  hundred  times                greater. I will refer the glory of any success to God, but                the  reproach  to  myself,  not  only  because  I  must  be                convinced that my work is little but also because of my                fault  I  do  not  produce  what  I  should.  If  Jesus  said:  «                When you have done all you have been told to do, say we                are ordinary servants; we have only done our duty » (Lk.                17, 10), what can I say of myself and of my spiritual or                intellectual  or  material  work,  which  Is  always  less  than                what I should do? I will say therefore: « Why should I go                on using up the soil »  (Lk. 13, 7)?                                                                            485                                 1. BEWARING OF PRIDE                      We  recommend  the  candidates  for  religious  life  to                beware  of  envy  and  pride,  because  the  devil  exploits  such                vices in the industrious youth. No candidate for religious life                will envy the fellows, nor will he become so enamored of the                study as to neglect the religious practices, nor will he behave                like the students for any civil profession, but will study for the                glory  of  God,  for  the  good  of  his  soul,  and  for  the  good  of                others (R.A.).                      What  is  knowledge  without  holiness?  It  is  vanity  of                vanities. A learned priest without holiness is a fateful","ruin. A priest who knows perfectly the moral law, but does not                observe it, is an inconsistent priest (Funeral oration on Canon                Ardoino).                                      2. THANKSGIVING                      The  mother  superior  will  see  to  it  that  anyone  who                succeeds  in  fine  arts  avoid  pride.  To  preserve  her  from                vainglory, she will warn her strongly, helping her understand                that everything is a gift from God and that everything must be                referred to him and to the adorable Lord Jesus Christ. When                the mother superior perceives that her warnings are useless,                she will interrupt the vainglorious person's study in fine arts,                regardless  of  her  success,  until  she  repents.  In  case  of                obstinacy, the mother superior will remove her from the study                for ever. The Lard will be pleased by that. To keep a youth                humble and to dispel vainglory, the mother superior will help                her consider how many persons are by far better than she is                in fine arts!                                             486                      When  the  sisters  are  advanced  in  fine  arts  and  have                already  produced  good  works,  the  mother  superior  will                organize  the  exhibition  every  now  and  then  to  foster  the                institute's  reputation,  to  let  the  people  know  the  youth's                achievements,  and  to  win  esteem,  respect,  and  admiration.                On the whole, the exhibition helps the institutes of active life                to  progress.  Introducing  the  exhibition  with  an  appropriate                speech  in  the  presence  of  reporters  is  important  and                convenient, for they recount the manifestation to the people                at  large.  During  the  exposition  the  mother  superior  will  pay                careful  attention  to  refer  the  good  success  to  God,  to  the                adorable  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  to  the  most  holy  Virgin,  the                angels, and the saints, helping the sisters to keep in mind this                great truth as well","as to remain humble by attributing their free gifts to God, by                praising and by cheering him alone.                      To direct everything to God, at the end of the exposition                the  mother  superior  will  lead  the  community  to  praise  God                through a thanksgiving in the church and the offering of a holy                mass.                      Convenience  suggests  that  the  community  write  the                thanksgiving to the sweetest Heart of Jesus and to the most                holy divine mother superior for the enlightenment and graces                they have granted, such as: they helped us accomplish the                works and moved many persons to visit the exposition to their                great  satisfaction,  our  failures  notwithstanding.  The                thanksgiving will end with an act of humility, for instance, by                saying: (( We confess before you, O Lord, that we are good                for nothing... See to it that everything may be beneficial to our                soul and that we do not usurp your gifts as if they were ours;                please help us to improve our sanctification, etc. )) We should                also remember that many people in the world are doing better   487                than we are!                      This way God will bless the exposition for the institute's                spiritual, and temporal progress, and will prepare new graces                for his glory and the good of souls. Amen.                                    3. LITTLE THEATER (1)                      The mother superior can allow theatrical performances in                the  institutes,  orphanages,  and  boarding  schools.  She  will                pay careful attention at the following:                      1.  Dramas,  comedies,  farces,  and  other  performances                must be very honest. On the whole, dramas must regard lives                of  martyrs  and  the  like;  by  exception,  not  too  much                passionate family love, such as between mother","and children having a marked religious characteristic, may be                allowed. (2)                      2.  Because  women  are  not  allowed  to  represent  male                characters, dramas of this kind will be avoided.                      3. Anyone, either adult or child, is absolutely forbidden to                dress  somehow  immodestly,  despite  the  character  she  is                portraying.                      4. Before approving a drama or a comedy or a farce, the                mother  superior  will  eliminate  the  unbecoming  words.  For                instance, sometimes the devil is called in interjections; that is                improper, because we must always detest his name; or the                most  holy  name  of  God  is  called  out  of  purpose,  in  vain;  it                must  be  corrected.  If  intelligent  and  of  religious  taste,  the                examiner of the contents will choose good dramas, comedies,                farces, soliloquies etc., (3) adding or modifying something or                dismissing  dull,  irrelevant  performances.  In  fact,  she  must                also  pay  attention  to  the  fact  that  while  moralizing,                performances  must  delight,  please  and  move  the  audience   488                (S.D.D.Z.).                                              NOTES                     (1)  About  the  little  theater,  our  padre  touches upon  details  which                are  worth  remembering:  «Because  it  is  of  importance  to  have  the                audience happy and admired, the little theater must be arranged well. It                should  be  wide  enough,  having  a  proportionate  background  and  the                stage  slightly  inclined  but  high  enough  so  that  the  audience  may  see                everything while sitting down. Where it is possible, the theater's hall may                be also used for the exposition of works, fine arts, distribution of prizes,                and  the  like.  If  the  theater's  orchestra  were  inclined  opposite  to  the                stage, it would be better, because the performance would be under the                eyes of all the people and would prevent the guests who are sitting in                the last seats from standing in order to see better. The little theater will                be provided with common scenes, which are suitable for various","performances,  and  with  particular  ones;  at  least  two  curtains  re-                presenting views of a little temple in the distance or hermitages or ships                carrying missionaries will be part of the apparatus, etc. A happy event of                our institute or a scene of sanctuaries, which belong to the city where                the  educational  institute  stands,  is  also  appropriate.  Curtains,  scenes,                wings, proscenium, etc., must be painted by experts. The lights will be                disposed  in such  a  way as  to enhance  the  scenes.  Both curtains  and                scenes must be placed in a firm cage to avoid any obstruction when they                are  lifted  up  or  are  lowered,  otherwise  they  bother  the  audience  and                embarass the actresses. Dresses will be smooth, various in color, and                fitting to the performance (S.D.D.Z.).                    (2)  As  to  the censure of  the  script,   our padre was  severe.   In                the circular of Oct. 22,  1923,  he wrote:   «Passion dramas,  such  as                mothers   in   search   of   their   daughters,   are   not   allowed   in   our                theater,   because  we  must  avoid   teaching  our   orphans   about                passionate  affection,  as experience  taught  us.  These  dramas  are                also unfitting  for  the   sisters,   since   they   must   be   fond   of   our                Lord only,   whereas   these   dramas   avert   their   attention   from                him   for excess  of family affection.                    More than once love expressions of husbands or lovers were in the                dramas; we cannot allow it, not even by allusion. For this reason, if the                drama of the farce lacks the approval of our institute, it will be sent to the                direction for it.»                    (3)  So that the performance may be effective, it needs:   489                    a)    A  good  choice  of  characters  as  to  be    in  harmony  with  their                roles;                    b)    Good  rehearsal.  After  choosing    the  characters,  a  director  of                good  taste  for  such  education  gathers  them  to  read  the  drama  many                times until they are well impressed. Then, she tells them to transcribe                their role  and  to  learn  it  by   heart.   Each  character will   recite   its                role to the director. When  all  of them  are  prepared,   the  general                rehearsal may start. The director will demand of each to speak loud and                clearly, because children and  young women who did  not  learn how  to                read well,  usually  recite fast  at a faint voice clipping  their speech,  and                without  taking   care  of  punctuation.  The   teacher  will not go ahead                until  they  amend.  To  overcome  this  serious  difficulty,  the  director  will                demand of each character to  read, to declaim the script, and to gesture                in  her presence in order to  improve them. After this preparation, the                rehearsal  will  be  easy,  and  will  take less  time;    otherwise,      it    takes                more   time  without  guaranteeing   success. In the ultimate  rehearsals,                particular  attention  will    be  given    to    the  two  last  acts  of  the  drama,                because  if  they  are  ill  performed,  they  ruin  the  effect  of  the  whole                drama»  (S.D.O.Z.).","490","CHAPTER XXVI                                  SACRED PREACHING                     If  my  superiors  destine  me  to  preaching,  I  will  give                preference  to  the  humblest  one,  such  as:  the                evangelization of the poor and of children as well as the                catechetical instruction to the people, avoiding to preach                myself  Instead  of  Jesus  crucified.  While  preaching  or                giving instructions or panegyrics or sermons, my topics                will  be  always  about  morals  in  order  to  fight  sin  under                any  form.  I  will  remind  the  people  of  the  eternal  truths                and the need to pray, as well as our Lord Jesus Christ's                love  and  sorrows,  the  holy  Sacraments,  and  the                Eucharist, striving to spread the practice of frequent and                daily  Communion  according  to  the  decree  by  the  Con-                gregation of the Council. (1) I will use Holy Scripture, the                Fathers  and  the  Doctors  of  the  Church,  as  well  as  the                lives of the saints. I will spread the devotion to the most                holy Virgin under any title, Including that to Our Lady of                the Evangelical Rogation and to Our Lady of Divine Zeal   491                (when they are approved), the devotion to the Patriarch                St.  Joseph,  to  the  angels  and  the  saints.  I  will promote                the  devotion  to  St.  Michael  the  archangel,  to  the  seven                angels of the divine presence, to the guardian angels, to                the holy apostles, the martyrs, the patron saints and to                St. Anthony of Padua.                    Even though I may sometimes use a higher style due                to the supernatural themes I treat, nonetheless I must be                very clear so that everyone, even children, uncouth and                Ignorant  people  may  understand  the  spirit  of  my                preaching  when  they  cannot  understand  the  words.                Before preaching, I will prepare my sermon and will pray                to the Most High to give success to the divine word, also                making  a  special  Invocation  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  of                Good Counsel and to my guardian angel.                    Being  detached  from  any  compensation  for  my                preaching, I will receive the offering the people give me                spontaneously, which I will consign to my superiors.","1. PREACHING APOSTOLICALLY                      The  priests  destined to  the  preaching  will  often  preach                Jesus  Christ'  crucified  with  holy  apostolical  simplicity  and                unction, keeping in mind the decree by the Holy Father Leo                XIll in order to reach the apostolical goal. They must be clear,                accurate, and brief (C. R.). (2)                                  2. THE TRUE ELOQUENCE                      We  hope  that  many  persons  are  convinced,  about  the                real  value  of  the  gospel  preachers.  Please  reject  the  vain                boasting of the entangled scholasticism and of the nebulous                philosophy. When a parable of the gospel is explained well, it                is  more  worthy  than  all  the  redundant  declamations.  The                Christian morals are so rich that you can always draw from                them successfully with a little work.                      The  prophet  says  that  the  declaration  of  God's  word   492                ,lightens  and  gives  understanding  to  the  children.  Wasn't  it                through the practical treatment of morals that many preachers                reached  the  top  of  Christian  eloquence,  as  Massillon,                Bourdalue, and Bossuet in France, Segneri, Tornielli, Venini,                Ventura and others in Italy? It was through the explanations                of the gospel and the teaching of morals to the people that                Tertulian, St. Augustine, St. Basil, and St. John Chrysostom,                an  everlasting  miracle  of  Christian  eloquence,  reached  the                top of oratory.                      Please accustom yourselves to these morals; draw the                sound  theological  doctrine  from  the  Bible,  the  Fathers,  and                the gospel: Plan the contents of your preaching. Beautify and                make  them  pleasant.  Cope  with  the  ministry  of  the  divine                word with pure intention, contrition of heart,","order, clarity, opportunity, sobriety of decoration, and you will                improve  the  soul's!  We  must  keep  in  mind  that  we  must                preach  Jesus  Christ  crucified,  not  ourselves  (From  the                Catholic Word, Jan. 2, 1878)!                                             NOTES                     (1)  The decree on the daily Communion was published a few years                before our padre wrote these lines.                    (2) Today we have many pontifical documents on sacred preaching.                We  remember  Humani  generis by Pius  XII  along with  his  talks  to  the                parish priests and the Lenten preachers of Rome as well as John XXIII’s                various speeches.                                                                                 493","494","CHAPTER XXVII                             THE MINISTRY OF CONFESSION                     I will strive to be available to hear confessions and to                practice  such  a  ministry  with  caution  and  spirit  of                sacrifice.                      I  will  often  study  moral  theology,  will  attend  the                monthly  moral  case  after  examining  it  thoroughly,  and                will be acquainted with the censures, the cases reserved                to  the  Ordinary,  the  dispositions  of  the Holy  See  about                the administration of the sacraments, the fasting, and the                like.  Instead  of  hearing  the  confessions  of  prominent                people I will prefer hearing the confessions of  children,                of  the  abandoned  poor,  and  of  the  sick,  being  always                available to welcome everyone, rich, poor, and those who                seldom go to confession.                     As  to  the  confessions  of  women,  young  girls                Included, I will be very cautious. I will never let them kiss   495                my hand nor will I stare at their face nor will I lengthen                out the  speech; on  the  contrary  I  will  keep  in  mind  the                suggestion of St. Augustine, « talk with women must be                brief and austere. »                     If I am told to hear the confessions of the twin insti-                tute's  sisters,  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  I  will  study                their  constitutions  or  declarations.  Realizing  that  their                rule demands of them to be brief in the confession, I will                not lengthen them out, but I will expedite them.                     Aware  of  the  great  difficulties  which  hinder  from                exactly  fulfilling  the  duty  of  hearing  the  sacramental                confessions,  I  will  resort  to  study,  to  God,  and  to  the                most  holy  Virgin  for  graces,  enlightenment,  help,  and                virtue in order to perform everything in a holy manner.","Priests must be always available at the confessionals to                hear  the  confessions  of  women  and  men,  giving  no                preference to anyone (C.R.).                      Because  the  moral  theology  leads  the  human  actions                toward God for the eternal salvation of the people, the priest                will study moral theology thoroughly. It teaches which actions                are good, which are neutral in quality, which lead to ruin or to                salvation. By giving the rules of living according to divine law,                moral  theology  guides  the  people  by  hand  to  eternal'                salvation.  Therefore,  it  is  an  indispensable  science  for  the                priests,  who  must  study  it  under  strict  obligation  of                conscience. Knowledge of moral theology is as important and                indispensable as it is difficult, because it is not so pleasant as                dogma tics, which lifts human minds to the sublime regions of                the infinite. The priests have to strive hard to learn it by heart.                This  study  requires  a  special  disposition,  a singular  insight,                perseverance  of  good  will,  anal  untiring  patience  (On  the                death of Canon Ardoino).                                                                           496","CHAPTER XXVIII                                    MY CONFESSION                     After speaking of the ministry of holy confession to                which I must attend as a confessor, now as a penitent I                consider the importance of practicing such a sacrament                to profit by It. Following our constitutions, I will go every                week  to  confession  after  preparing  myself  attentively.  I                will  prefer  the  confessors  of  the  same  institute,  but  for                good reasons I can ask the superiors to provide me with                an external one.                    Since  the  sacrament  of  reconciliation  has  been                established  to  forgive  sins,  to  become  reconciled  with                God, and to Improve the spiritual life, I will strive to have                a humble, contrite, sincere, and resolute heart at the feet                of the confessor.                    After  kneeling  humbly  and  after  saying  the  «  I                confess... », I will manifest, with contrite heart and voice,                the sins I have committed in thoughts, words, and works                as  well  as  my  defects  and  offences  against  these   497                declarations  and  against  our  rules,  adding  the                aggravating circumstances. I will not justify myself, nor                will I hide even the least defects, nor will I lay the blame                on others; on the contrary, I will charge myself with fault.                    By  considering  how  much  a  priest  displeases  God                even  through his  venial  sins  and how dangerous  these                sins are, I will excite a deep sorrow in my heart for my                offences  against  God,  firmly  proposing  to  amend  as                though  my  confession  were  the  last  one  and  I  were                dying.  I  will  profit  by  the  words,  admonitions,  and                counsels of the confessor as if Jesus Christ himself were                speaking  to  me,  and  will  do  the  penance  and  the                thanksgiving  prayer  for  the  confession  shortly  after  It.                Were  I  to  commit  a  somewhat  grave  fault,  I  will  go  to                confession  before  going  to  sleep:  I  pledge  this  in  the                most solemn and outspoken way. Were it impossible for                me to confess the same day (but I will find a way to do                so), I will concentrate myself with acts of sorrow and love                at the foot of the Holy","Sacrament in the evening, and the next day I will hasten                to make my confession.                      I acknowledge that going to confession often, even                twice  or  three  times  a  week,  is  a  great  means  of                sanctification; I am firmly convinced that if I were really                convinced  of  this  truth,  I  would  go  to  confession  more                than once a week. Were the scruples, however, to move                me  to  do  so,  I  will  follow  the  confessor's  advice  and                commands as well as the moderators of my conscience.                                    1. THE OBLIGATION                      On the day of their weekly confession, while meditating                in  the  morning,  the  novices  will  ask  the  mast  holy  Heart  of                Jesus  to  grant  them  the  grace  of  a  good  confession,  to                understand  deeply  and  entirely  their  defects  along  with                malice,  and  to  confess  them  to  the  priest  with  a  humble,                docile, contrite heart. Before going to confession, following St.   498                Francis of Sales' suggestion, they will gather in the choir or in                another place in order to make the examination of conscience                for 15 minutes, the act of contrition, and the promise to never                sin  again.  That  day,  the  novices  will  be  more  contrite  and                recollected, and will make their confession by speaking briefly                and concisely. They will consider the confessor as our Lord                Jesus Christ; therefore, they will respect him and will receive                each of his words as the word of God, calling to mind that our                Lord Jesus Christ said to his priests, «Whoever listens to you,                listens  to  me  »  (Lk.  10,  16).  I  recommend  it  to  my  spiritual                daughters, the Little Retreat novices, and exhort them to keep                it  in  their  mind  in  order  to  practice  it  with  our  Lord  Jesus                Christ's  help.  They  will  receive  the  confessor  that  holy                obedience  gives  them as  he  were  given  by  Gad;  therefore,                they will not change","him, because changing the confessor without a good reason                is to the prejudice of the spirit (R.L.P.). (1)                      Established by our Lord Jesus Christ to forgive sins, the                sacrament of reconciliation is also a most effective means for                the people to achieve Christian perfection. The probationers                will  hold  it  in  great  esteem,  striving  to  use  it  with  the  due                dispositions.  They  will  go  to  confession  every  week,  after                preparing themselves in common through the examination of                conscience over even the least defects, and after fostering a                deep sorrow and contrition. They are recommended to do it                with a humble, sincere, contrite heart:  Humble means going                to the feet of the priest with inner feelings of humility in order                to confess not only the faulty actions but also the intentions,                not only the defects, but also the passions that are the roots                of the defects, without justifying themselves, according to St.                Francis of Sales' suggestions. Humility in confession requires                of the penitent to charge himself with fault, not others, as well                as to follow in everything the confessor's counsels, warnings,                and  admonitions.  The  probationers  are  forbidden  to  say                things concerning the confession (P.R.P.). (2)            499                                      2. THE PRACTICE                      The sacrament of reconciliation is a priceless gift of the                most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus.  May  everyone  profit  by  it!  This                divine  sacrament  not  only  forgives  sins,  but  also  helps                wonderfully those who are willing to improve holy virtues and                to achieve perfection. When a Religious goes to confession in                the spirit of penance and humility, she receives a very special                grace, which prevents her from lapsing and from falling in the                daily imperfections.                      To attain the effects of this very precious sacrament,","the person consecrated to the Lord should receive it with the                due dispositions. While going to confession, she will have a                mind to go to the tribunal of penance in order to purify herself                from even the least sin, and to adorn herself with the merits of                our Lord Jesus Christ's Mast Precious Blood, which overflows                in this sacrament. The Daughters of Divine Zeal will go to the                sacrament  of  reconciliation  with  this  holy  aim,  and  will                practice the five requirements of the holy confession.                      1. Examination of conscience. We cannot suffer a hasty,                shallow  examination   of   conscience.  After   imploring                enlightenment  and  graces  in  order  to  remember  the  faults                committed since the last confession, as well as to resolve, to                repent,  and  to  confess  with  great  humility,  clearness,  and                simplicity, the examination of conscience must last at least 15                minutes. After the preparation, each one will think over even                her venial sins, the number of them and the circumstances.                No  person  consecrated  to  the  Lord  and  willing  to  sanctify                herself  is  al9owed  to  confess  a  sin  without  specifying  how                many times it was committed as well as its circumstances. To                tell  the  truth,  theologically  speaking  the  people  are  not   500                required necessarily to confess venial sins; but a person who                is  willing  to  belong  totally  to  God,  who  detests  any  offence                against Him, who strives to amend from any imperfection and                bad  habit,  who  absolutely  wants  to  avoid  indifference;  who                wants to improve the love of Jesus and the religious virtues,                this  person  feels  very  obliged  to  confess  the  venial  sins  in                order to achieve perfection. Every one knows that negligence                in  avoiding  venial  sins  is  the  first  step  for  falling  in  serious                faults.                      Mindful of the words that our Lord addressed to all, but                especially to the Religious and to the persons consecrated to                him: « You must be perfect - just as your","Father in heaven is  perfect »  (Mt. 5, 48), the Daughters of                Divine Zeal must be aware of the least imperfection. Another                time Jesus said: « You will give account even of an idle word!                »  Therefore,  the  sisters  will  confess  the  least  imperfections                along  with  number  and  circumstances,  (3)  after  making  a                good examination of conscience. I submit some examples to                you.  Suppose  that  one  is  at  fault  with  obedience;  she  will                think both over how many times she disobeyed and over the                circumstances, which are important in the process of spiritual                improvement; or a sister disobeyed after her another superior                had told her to do something urgent, or she knew beforehand                that disobedience could cause bad effects; or a sister failed in                her important office, causing inconveniences and much grief                to the mother superior, and so on.                      Bad  example  is  a  circumstance  which  must  be  never                neglected  in  the  examination  of  conscience  and  in  con-                fession.  Saying,  far  instance,  «  I  kept  some  unnecessary                objects, against the rule of poverty, » a is not complete. The                sister  has to  specify  how many  and  what  the  objects  were,                when  she  felt  the  remorse,  and  when  despite  the  remorse   501                she did not hand them over to the mother superior. Or, if the                sister  received  the  objects  from  fellows,  she  has  to  specify                that she set a bad example to them by receiving the objects.                      The root means the passion or the internal malice which                pushes people to do ill. For instance, if a sister received the                objects  from  a  fellow  under  the  pressure  of  false  courtesy                more than by ambition, the fault is due to her own inordinate                esteem,  because  she  avoided  to  appear  rude.  Let  us                suppose instead that she received","the  objects  because  she  was  tied  by  a particular  friendship                and  she  did  not  wish  to  displease  her  friend  in  order  to                maintain  her  friendship.  Here,  the  root  is  the  inordinate                attachment  to  a  creature.  Now,  let  us  suppose  that  the                appropriation  happened  without  the  cooperation  of  others.                Here  we  find  two  sins:  embezzlement  and  infringement  of                poverty. But the main root is greed. We said main, because                we may find other roots generating a sin; for instance, if the                sister  took  the  objects  in  order  to  use  them,  she  did  so                because of her attachment to comfort.                      In  the  examination  of  conscience  also  the  aim  of  our                actions is to be considered. Far instance, if a sister took or                retained the objects in order to figure in some occasion, such                an aim shows that the root or passion is vainglory.                      Oh! If the Lord enlightened us to perceive and define our                sins and our light imperfections as they really are, hove many                roots  of  hidden  passions  we  would  discover  in  ourselves!                Hence the necessity of making a very accurate examination                of  conscience  with  recollection  and  divine  enlightenment,   502                instead  of  making  it  on  the  surface,  as  some  do!  If  both                examination of conscience and confession were made in full,                the  people  would  improve  very  much!  They  would  kill  their                hidden  passions  by  a  renewal  of  spirit  and  by  adorning                themselves  in  the  sacrament  of  reconciliation.  They  would                share the Lord's supper while wearing the wedding dress and                the  splendid  jewels  of  divine  kindness,  and  would  appear                beautiful and immaculate to the eyes of the celestial spouse!                      During the examination of conscience, careful attention                must be also paid to the habit of the sin, because the habit is                the  cause  of  relapse;  therefore  it  must  be  withdrawn.  The                consideration  of  the  habit  and  of  the  relapse  helps  the                persons to repent and to confess in","order  to  destroy  their  bad  habits  with  the  Lord's  help.  The                purification  of  the  person  should  be  the  real  profit  derived                from confession.                      To  conclude  this  topic,  we  suppose  another  case.  If  a                person  had  a  mortal  sin  -  (God  forbid  it)  -  but  she  did  not                confess it for serious lack of examination of conscience, the                confession would be invalid.                      2.  Repentance.  Repentance  of  one's  own  sins  and                resolution to never sin again are most important; they matter                much more than the examination of conscience. It is obvious                that  those  who  do  not  repent  sincerely  of  their  faults  are                unwilling to amend. Well then, what's the use of confession                for them? They must pay careful attention to repentance and                resolution.                      A consecrated person who pledged fidelity to God as to                her divine spouse, and received innumerable graces from him                cannot  help  repenting  deeply  after  making  a  good                examination  of  conscience  and  discovering  so  many  venial   503                sins.                      We have said venial sins; but they are offence against                God. They are the cause of very deep sorrow to the Heart of                Jesus,  because  he  requires  greatest  faithfulness  and                perfection of his brides, who have pledged so many times to                never displease him.                      Please let us consider the two following truths:                      First,  if  all  souls  who  are  in  hell  would  be  liberated  by                committing even a venial deliberate sin, such a sin should not                be committed. The reason is that all creatures, compared with                God, are as nothing, as though they did not exist, says the                Scripture.                     Second,  our  Lord  takes  into  much  consideration  the                deliberate venialities and negligences of the persons who are                consecrated to him, because he asks of them compensation                for the sins of the world. When he finds no","compensation,  we  say  that  he  suffers  more  the  venial  sins                committed -by the consecrated persons than the mortal sins                committed by the mundane people. The Lord excuses more                the  mundane,  because  they  have  less  knowledge  and  less                spiritual  help  than  the  persons-consecrated  to  him.  For  the                sinners who are ire the world, Jesus can repeat the words he                said on the crass: « Forgive them, Father! They don't know                what they are doing » (Lk. 23, 34). Can he say the same for                you,  O  soul,  who  received  instructions,  spiritual  readings,                exhortations,  and  teachings?  Who  listened  to  many                preachings, who have been granted many graces, who were                enlightened  so  often,  and  who  have  rules  and  additional                helps? Hove can Jesus say of you, Daughter of Divine Zeal, «                Forgive her, Father! She does not know what she is doing »                (Lk. 23, 34)? You are fully aware of how Jesus is displeased                for the venial sins you commit deliberately or by negligence,                owing to not retracted habits or to bad roots of not mortified                passions.  If  Jesus  were  subject  to  death,  he  would  die  of                affliction at the sight of your faults and relapses, because they                render  you  lukewarm  and  push  you  on  the  edge  of  grave                faults and eternal perdition!                             504                      These  reasons  give  you  ground  far  a  deep,  intimate,                loving, and mournful repentance for any imperfection and sin                that  you  acknowledge  in  your  accurate  examination  of                conscience,  before going  to  confession.  Through  your  faith,                you will see Jesus shedding tears for your sins, showing you                his adorable wounds bleeding for your offences against him,                and asking you to pour balm on the wounds you caused. The                tears  of  your  sincere  repentance  will  be  the  balm.  While                preparing  yourself  for  the  sacrament  of  reconciliation  by                considering  these  notes,  you  will  raise  your  sincere                repentance  and  will  show  it  to  Jesus  through  the  inner,                beautiful words that the love","of  Jesus  will  suggest  to  you.  You  will  imagine  yourself  as                dropping  down  at  his  feet  to  ask  forgiveness  with  the  most                tender voices of your heart, and to promise with his help that                you will never offend him again at any cost.                     Your resolution consists in this promise.                     3. Resolution. Repentance of one's own sins without the                resolution  to  never  sin  again  is  a  false,  fictious,  deceitful                repentance.  Wouldn't  it  be  another  offense  against  God?                Making such a confession and receiving the absolution would                be a sacrilege.                     Helped  by  divine  grace,  which  never  fails  the  persons                who  ask  for  it,  each  Religious  of  this  community  must  pay                careful attention to raise a sincere repentance and to make                the resolution to sin no more. Everyone should imagine her                confession as the last one of her life and herself as a dying.                How  contrite  and  resolute  to never  sin  she would  be  in  the                tribunal of penance! And yet, no one knows if she is about to                die soon after the confession or in the following days. Hasn't   505                it  happened  so  to  many  people  who  went  to  confession                without thinking that it might be the last one? Had they known                it,  with  how  much  repentance  they  would  have  made  their                confession! Couldn’t it happen to you?                     While  preparing  yourself,  see  to  it  that  your  repentance                and resolution be just as Jesus requires them! In fact, if Jesus                does not absolve you from heaven, the priest's absolution is                useless  or  sacrilegious.  In  this  case  you  become  more                inclined to evil, and by approaching the great banquet of the                angels  without  the  wedding  dress  you  attract  the                condemnation and the rejection of Jesus as a just judge. You                do  not  receive  him  as  a  loving  spouse!  Instead  of  being                medicine  and  salvation,  the  beneficial  sacrament  of                reconciliation would be for you poison and ruin.","4. Confession. Each one will approach the sacrament of                reconciliation to confess her sins to the minister of God, being                prepared, contrite, and with her eyes cast down.                      She  will  hold  the  confessor  as  the  deputy  of  Jesus                Christ  without  making  any  distinction  between  the  various                confessors, and will begin her confession by saying: Father,                forgive  me,  because  I  have  sinned.  After  the  prayer  I                confess... (possibly in Latin), she will tell the father her sins,                making her confession entire, humble, clear, simple, contrite,                and sorrowful.                       Entire confession means that the penitent has to confess                her  sins  along  with  the  number,  the  species,  and  the                circumstances, denouncing the root and everything we have                said in the examination of conscience. A Religious who takes                care  both  of  amending  bad  inclinations  and  of  improving                holiness, confesses even the least defects she has found in                her examination, without leaving out anything.                                                                          506                     Humble  confession:  the  Religious  must  beware  of                justifying her defects; instead of diminishing her responsibility                or laying part of the blame on others, she has to increase her                fault, laying the blame on herself. The more she pleads guilty                (she has already said through my own fault in the I confess),                the  more  she  finds  mercy  and  forgiveness  in  the  adorable                Jesus. This is the humble confession.                      Humble confession also demands that the penitent listen                to  the  confessor's  advice  and  reproaches  respectfully,                profiting by them as though our Lord himself were speaking                and admonishing.                      Clear   confession   regarding   the   speech:   the                pronunciation  must  be  clear  so  that  the  priest  may                understand  everything  without  being  compelled  to  ask  you:                please","speak clearly. This fact requires a proper distance between the                persons who are making confession and the others who are waiting                outside. The confessional must be done in such a way as to prevent                the outsiders from hearing.                       Simple  confession:  holy  simplicity  in  pleading  guilty  in                the  confession  demands  avoidance  of  useless  words.  The                penitents  will  follow  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  saying,  «  Just                say, \"Yes\" or \"No\" » (Mt. 5, 37).                      Simplicity  helps  the  confession  to  be  short:  which  we                recommend to the Daughters of Divine Zeal. They will avoid                the bad habit of prolonging the confession beyond necessity                by practicing St. Theresa's suggestion: « Be long at the feet                of the Crucifix, but short at the feet of the confessor. » We do                not deny, however, that either the confessor or the penitent                sometimes  needs  to  prolong  the  confession  beyond  the                ordinary time. The matter is: we must avoid to give free play                to selfishness as well as to lose time and simplicity of spirit.                The confessor is under the control of God alone; the results   507                of  abuses  are  perceptible  however.  Generally,  those  who                spend more time at the confessional are the  less observant                and  the  less  earnest,  the  crack-brained  who  are  the  most                troublesome in many circumstances.                      Simplicity is also concerned with the Daughters of Divine                Zeal's prudence. A sister who loves the institute, the house,                and the superiors, will avoid saying things which discredit the                community or scandalize the confessor. The sisters who give                free play by selfishness make the confessor believe that they                are treated uncharitably or are compelled to overwork or are                not cured properly in their sickness. They do not behave as                daughters  of  the  institute,  but  as  strangers  who  harm  the                institute and hinder vocations. In this case the confessor feels                himself obliged to impede some sisters from continuing","in the religious life. May Jesus free this humble community of                the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  from  such  individuals!  These                unfaithful persons are self-confident because the superiors do                not  know  what  has  been  said  in  confession,  nor  they  can                contradict  it,  nor  can  they  justify  themselves.  Should  it                happen  (God  forbid  it),  these  individuals  must  consider  that                God knows everything, will punish them, and will deliver the                community from their charges.                      Contrite  confession:  compunction  requires  of  the                penitents  to  express  their  contrite  mood  in  the  confession.                Even the tone of the voice is apt to express the inner feelings,                the sorrow, and humiliation.                      The, sorrowful confession concerns the repentance and                the  resolution  which  the  penitent  made  during  the                examination  of  conscience  and  expressed  in  the  act  of                contrition,  before  receiving  the  absolution.  The  penitent  will                say  it  with  deep  humility,  compunction,  and  repentance,                expressing  the  resolution  to  never  sin  again  with  internal   508                conviction.                      5.  Penance  or  satisfaction.  After  the  accusation  of  her                sins,  the  penitent  will  conclude  by  saying:  «  Father,  forgive                me, and give me the penance. » After receiving the penance                with humility, she will return contrite and modest, will kneel,                and  will  do  her  penance.  Soon  after  she  will  make  the                thanksgiving for the forgiveness of her sins and for the graces                she has received in the sacrament of reconciliation.                      Warning:  We  prevent  everyone  from  becoming  dis-                heartened on the suggestion of the evil for the fact that after                the sorrowful confession and the resolution to never sin again                she commits the same faults.                      When a sister commits without deliberation the faults she                has  confessed  with  sorrow  and  with  the  resolution  to  never                commit them again, she must not be afraid nor","discouraged;  instead,  she  has  to  humble  herself,  sweetly                renewing  her  resolution.  In  fact,  even  though  the  Lord  is                displeased by these defects, yet he finds satisfaction in the                humility and in the resolution of the person who is willing to                amend. If while receiving the absolution or while making the                resolution  to  never  sin  again  the  penitent  foresees  that  she                will  relapse,  this  fact  does  not  prevent  her  sorrow  and                resolution  from  being  true.  Here  is  the  rub:  the  sister  must                really want her sanctification and her amendment from even                the least imperfections. Who finds herself in these conditions,                must be calm. She must not become disheartened, nor lose                trust, nor listen to the hellish enemy, who fosters distrust and                discouragement,  but  will  humble  herself  and  will  ask  her                spouse  to  forgive  and  to  help.  She  will atone  with  penance                and love, and all this will help her to be closer to the Lord.                Thus, the saying of the apostle « We know that in all things                God works for goad with those who love him » (Ram. 8, 28),                comes true (S.D.D.Z.). (4)                                                                            509                                           NOTES                      (1)    Because  in  the  confession  we  have  to  say  only  the  things                regarding  the sacrament,   I  promise  to  observe  the  following   rule: I                will  spend  at  the  confessional  the  time  necessary  for  the  confession                without speaking  of the  direction  and  of the discipline which  rule the                institute.  Still  less  will  I  escape  the  regular  observance  by  using  the                confessor's    counsel    or  consent,    because    the  confessor    is    not                qualified   to   interfere   in   the   direction   and   the   discipline   of   the                institute;  therefore,  I  will  behave  according  to  the  mother  superior's                orders, counsels, and guide according to the institute's rules (D.P.).                    (2)    «  Each   congregant  will  go to confession  every  week, either                with  the  ordinary  or  the  extraordinary  confessors  of  the  community.                Holding  in great esteem  the sacrament of reconciliation,  everyone","will prepare himself and will confess his defects along with the cause of                them  with  great  humility,  as  required  by  religious  perfection.  After                exciting a sharpest sorrow for his sins, he will make a firm resolve to sin                no more, will follow the confessor's counsels, doing at last his penance                faithfully. During the confession no one will apologize for his-defects nor                will he speak of things which have nothing to do with the sacrament. The                confession will be brief, simple, umble, and sincere; such a confession                will bring out great profits (C.R.).                    (3) Our padre wrote the following formula to help the sisters have a                good examination of conscience:                    «  Have  you  neglected  the  meditatoin  under  some  pretext  or  for                laziness  or  to  avoid  inconveniences?  —  Were  you  languid,  absent-                minded, slothful? — Did you say the vocal prayers correctly? — Did you                keep the perfect silence? — Were you angry or rude with your fellows?                —  Did  you  hold  a  grudge?  —  Did  you  gossip  with  other  people?  —                Against  whom  did  you  gossip?  —  Did  you  gossip  by  yourself  in  your                innermost? — Did you  take pleasure  in hearing  people speaking ill of                others? — Did you plot with fellows against the rules and the religious                virtues?  —  Did  you  hush  up  the  community's  disorders  instead  of                referring them to the mother superior in order to avoid prejudice to the                house or to souls? — Did you make your confession with repentance,                resolve,  humility,  sincerity,  simplicity,  without  useless  speech  and                without apology? — Did you really repent and resolve? — Did you make                the examination of conscience well? — Did you make the penance?

The confessor is not the institute's director. Had the Religious to follow                the  confessor's  advice  about  the  institute's  regime,  each  confessor                would give his own counsel, following his way of thinking; the rules of the                institute,  therefore,  should  be  changed  continuously,  which  is                unacceptable.                    b) No one will talk about things regarding the confession, such as                the ones said by the penitent or the confessor, etc.» (S.D.D.Z.).                                                                                    511","512","CHAPTER XXIX                           PERSEVERANCE IN THE INSTITUTE                     Because I entered this pious Institute by my own free                will,  and  received  a  hearty  welcome  when  I  joined  this                religious group, I feel obliged to love and consider it as                my spiritual family.                    I declare that I want to persevere in it faithfully and                lovingly,  and  even  though  any  congregant  can  freely                leave the Institute before taking the perpetual vows, I flee                from  this  thought  because  Jesus  said:  «  Anyone  who                starts to plow and then keeps looking back is of no use                for the kingdom of God » (Lk. 9, 62), Ecclesiasticus has                also:  « Stand firm in the lot set before thee. »                     Were  a  real  reason  to  suggest  Itself  to  leave  the                Institute  before  taking  the  perpetual  vows,  the  reason                should  be  the  serious  decline  of  the  whole  order.  The                decline  of  a  single  community,  the  difficulty  to  observe                the  rule  or  these  promises,  the  inconveniences  of  holy   513                poverty,  being  on  bad  terms  with  someone,  personal                oppositions,  the  sacrifice  required  to  face  work,  the                insinuations or the difficulties to follow holy obedience,                pretext of health, and the like are not a good reason to                leave the institute. Therefore, I will consider these moti-                vations  as  temptations  of  the  hellish  enemy,  and  will                manifest them to the superior in order to get rid of them.                     An  additional  dangerous  snare  of  the  devil  is  the                suggestion  to  seek  advice  from  priests  who  are  not                committed  to  holy  perfection,  nor  are  they  acquainted                with  religious  life;  on  the  contrary,  they  oppose  this                institute by instinct, and do not trust it.                     If   reasons   of   general   decline   oppose   my                perseverance,  I  will  not  make  any  decision  before                submitting everything to the superiors, before praying to                the  Heart  of  Jesus  and  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  and                before  taking  advice  from  holy  wise  priests,  especially                the religious ones.","1. LET US LOVE OUR INSTITUTE                      I promise to exactly observe not only this institute's rule                but  also  its  present  and  future  customs  along  with  its                practices. As a member of this institute by the grace of the                Lord, I will cherish and consider it as the house of my spiritual                activity  and  as  my  spiritual  family;  its  interests  will  be  mine                (D.P.).                      The  probationers  will  consider  the  religious  community                as their real family, and from now on they will love it strongly,                constantly, and invincibly, dedicating themselves to it for ever                with all their strength (R.P.).                      One who has left his family home to devote himself to                the  religious  institute,  must  love  it  with  great  respect,                affection, and interest considering it as his own native abode,                where he has been born again spiritually; therefore, it is his                real spiritual family, whose pains, joys, and fortunes he must                feel and share with a strong, constant love (C.R.).                                                                          514                     The  holy  cross,  suffering,  and  want  are  necessary                means to form an institution, but happy is she who immolates                herself  for  the  consolation  of  the most holy Heart  of  Jesus!                The  Daughter  of  Divine  Zeal  must  carry  the  cross  and                immolate  herself  for  the  sanctification  and  the  salvation  of                souls (Letter without date)!                      Let  us  love  our  institute;  let  us  give  ourselves  to  it  in                order  to  build  its  spiritual  structure...  Let  us  not  be                disheartened...  Let  us  love  the  institute  and  its  dear  name:                Rogation of Jesus' Heart. Jesus loves it; he gave us the most                beautiful hopes for its future; if we reflect on it, we realize that                God wants it!                      Even  though  our  institute  is  small,  still  its  aim  and                mission are such that belonging to it and sharing in it make us                happy! I am not speaking of the poor, nor of the","orphans, but of the banner,« Pray, therefore, to the owner of                the harvest... » What a mercy, what a gift! What an honor is                our  being  appointed  to  pick  up,  spread,  and  point  out  this                word to Christianity. It is like saying: behold, people, here is                the remedy to all evils! Such a mission is so sublime that I                feel like annihilating myself (Speech, April 21, 1907)!                      The vocation to a religious institute is a great gift of God,                through  which  you  can  assure  your  salvation  and                sanctification! But, what merit did you have? « I loved Jacob,                but I hated Esau » (Rom. 9, 13). How many people God has                left out! You were a poor child, but behold! God chose you                (Speech,  Feb.  1,  1912).  Who  were  you?  Which  were  your                wishes? What was your infancy? What the fortunes of your                life?  Oh,  how  far  you  were  from  thinking  of  such  a  great                honor! Perhaps the doors of the religious houses would have                never  opened  for  you,  if  the  Lord  had  not  raised  this  least                institute! The Lord formed it to take you away from the world                and to place you here (Speech, April 21, 1907)..                      Let us consider the great present the Lard made to us by   515                calling  us  to  this  institute,  and  by  making  us  became  most                particular  because  of  two  special  reasons.  The  Lord,                however, wants us to esteem it, to be grateful, and to answer                so a great mercy.                      a)  The  first  reason  resides  in  the  beginning  of  the                foundation.  What  is  a  religious  foundation  all  about?  It  is  a                mystery of grace and salvation! A new harbor, a new ladder                of Jacob, a work pleasing the angels.                      b) The first vacations are privileged. When an institute is                already  formed  and  spread,  the  persons  who  go  to  it  find                everything  ready,  and  they  somehow  enjoy  the  fruit  of  the                work  of  the  previous  vacations.  The  first  vocations  instead,                are called to form the institute, to lay","down its foundations; if they answer the call, their merits wall                be great before the Lord, because they are the founders, and                deserve the praise of the future vocations! Well then, the Lord                called  us  first  to  form  the  institute,  to  be  the  foundation                stones. Oh, what a gift!                      Small as it may be a community, each member has two                main  obligations:  1)  he  has  to  strive  to  achieve  personal                perfection;  2)  he  has  to  strive  together  with  the  fellows  to                achieve the perfection of the community, and of the institute.                      Dearest brothers, it is Gads will that each of us sanctify                himself; that all the members form this least institute as God                wants it; and that it last for his glory and for the good of souls.                In other words, the Lard wants us not to hinder, but to foster                his aims and ways (Speech, April 21, 1925).                                  2. WE ARE FORTUNATE                      The formation of an institute pleases God so much, and   516                gladdens the Heart of Jesus, the most holy Mary, the angels,                and  the  saints.  All  of  them  help  us,  but  hell  shudders  and                persecutes  nothing  else  so  much  as  the  formation  of  a                religious institute.                      Let  us  work!  We  cannot  form  it  with  flying  colors,  but                difficulties will not dishearten us... Please let us strive for our                sanctification, seeking the institute's formation as God wants                it!  Please  let  us  perform  all  things  as  well  as  we  can  to                sanctify  ourselves,  let  us  sanctify  ourselves  in  order  to                perform what we can... Let us answer our call It depends on                our faithfulness if the Lord will carry out his loving aims on us                and on the institute.                      In  his  infinite  goodness  our  Lord  gave  us  so  -many                graces and the hope that he will fulfill his loving aims","and  our  wishes,  if  we  are  faithful.  Let  us  remember  the                marvelous ways through which he guided us: we reached the                present  position  from  almost  nothing;  he  gave  us  plenty  of                means, helping us to overcome several obstacles; everytime                we were prostrated, he raised us. He gave us many spiritual                favors through many illustrious prelates...                      If the Lord has decided to form this institute, we must be                the first stones with his help, as it happens in the foundations:                the  first  members  deserve  the  foundation's  merit.  See,                therefore, of how great importance is striving to achieve; our                sanctification by answering our call!                      How much the mast holy Heart of Jesus rejoices when                we  work  for  the  formation  of  a  small  religious  community!                How much he rejoices when we strive to spread the Rogate,                because  the  Rogate  will  prepare  the  new  generations  of                Levites. Let us trust in the most holy Heart of Jesus. Isn't be                interested in developing the institute?                      Let  us  also  trust  in  the  most  holy  Mary,  because  she   517                shares the interests of Jesus' Heart. Jesus is with us in the                Holy Sacrament, and the most holy Mary is with us because                we  are  consecrated  to  her,  as  her  children  and  slaves,                through a continuous devotion. Jesus and Mary are with us,                or better yet, we are with Jesus and Mary from the time we                have  proclaimed  them  as  our  absolute,  effective,  and                immediate superiors, invoking them as such.                      At  last,  let  us  trust  in  St.  Joseph.  Besides  being  the                universal patron, he too is concerned with the Rogate! In fact,                it is under his auspices that we renew the vows every year,                asking him for inner virtue.                      Because we have children and poor persons, we must                pay careful attention to edify them. Let us be vigilant so that                sin  may  not  enter;  it  would  be  the  ruin!  We  would  see                providence fail!","Children and brothers in Jesus Christ, if we are faithful, if                we  strive  to  improve  holiness,  to  seek  the  salvation  of  the                souls, and to spread the Rogate; if we are patient, if we have                a  .pure  intention  and  the  spirit  of  sacrifice,  and  if  we  pray,                sooner or later God will look upon us and upon the institute to                fulfill his laving aims, which are beyond our thoughts (Ibidem).                      Your fortune is that you are one who leaves her native                house  out  of  love  for  Jesus,  and  detaches  herself  from                everything,  renouncing  eventual  positions  in  the  world  in                order  to  choose  the  best  part,  the  Creator  of  heaven  and                earth, to whom she offers herself as an everlasting holocaust                of  love!  This  happiness  has  various  degrees,  this  wedding                with the supreme goodness has several functions. The mare                your  spiritual  intelligence  is  piercing,  and  the  more  your                affections  of  faith  are  ,intimate  and  delicate,  the  more  the                band  of  your  mystical  wedding  is  tightened.  The  more  you                imitate his divine humility, feel the living burning flame of his                love, savor his pains along with the mysteries of his suffering                that the world does not appreciate, and like Moses' wife say                to him, « bridegroom of blood you are for me » (Ex. 4, 26),   518                the more you can call yourself a bride of the Nazarene Lord.                      Such  a  happiness,  before  which  the  highest  earthly                happiness is dust and misery; such a happiness of the virgin                consecrated to the divine spouse is only the beginning of the                inconceivable  happiness  which  is  stored  for  her  in  the                kingdom  of  glory,  if  she  remains  faithful  to  her  vows  and                perseveres in her religious life... God's word in the mysterious                book  of  revelation  lifts  up  a  curtain  to  shave  the  future                mystery  of  glory  and  happiness,  telling  us  that  the  virgins                consecrated to God are privileged souls around the throne of                the immaculate lamb,","Jesus Christ, singing a new song that others cannot sing. O                daughter, how the spouse will welcome you when you pass                from  the  night  of  this  world  to  the  everlasting  day  of  his                kingdom! When the angels will tell you at the end of your life:                « Behold! The spouse is coming! » , your lamp will be full of                the tail of the good works. Oh, what a splendor will gird you in                the kingdom of glory! What precious crowns will be placed on                your  head!  What  joy  will  flood  you,  what  flood  of  purest                celestial  pleasure  will  enrapture  you  forever!  Then,  you  will                bless forever the most generous love that chose you from the                thousands  who  were  more  worthy  than  you  to  enter  the                religious life, you will bless the moment you said good-bye to                your parents, friends, and birth-place in order to embrace a                humble, mortified, contradicted, fatiguing life!                      Labor!  Sacrifice!  But,  what  labor,  what  sacrifice  very                different from the ones the world demands of its followers or                its victims! In the house of the Lord, his words « the yoke I will                give you is easy, and the load I will put on you is light » (Mt.                11, 30), come true! Everything turns out to be gentle and light                in  the  religious  life,  because  everything  is  sprinkled  by  the   519                interior  sweetness  of  grace  and  love  and  enhanced  by  the                delightful practices of piety; everything is full of the will which                seeks to please the celestial spouse, and of the hope of being                rewarded in heaven (Speech, 1908).                                  3. LET US BE FAITHFUL                      I  raise  my  voice  to  pass  from  the  canticle  of  joy  and                delight  to  the  mournful  woes  of  divine  threats!  The  spouse                who  chose  you  is  sweet,  gentle,  lovable,  but  she  is  also                terrible and dreadful as the apostle says, « God is indeed a                destroying fire » (Hebr. 12, 29). The spouse who chose","you  for  his  mystical  wedding,  despite  your  unworthiness,                demands  of  you  a  perfect  response  and  faithfulness  to  his                call. Woe to you, if you are negligent! The more mercy he had                on  you,  the  more  he  will  punish  you.  Then,  the  following                words of the gospel which decided your call,  « Two women                will be at the mill grinding meal: one will be taken away, the                other will be left behind » (Mt. 24, 41), will burden you with                complete ruin. Like Ahasuerus who rejected his wife Vasti for                a  slight  disobedience  and  chose  the  humble,  charming                Esther, so Jesus Christ will do with you, if you are unfaithful                and disobedient. He will reject you, and will choose another to                replace  you.  This  terrible  inversion  changes  the  roles                fatefully.  You  will  be  the  abandoned,  the  rejected  from  the                house of the Lord, the one given to perdition, while the other                will rise to the mystical wedding of the everlasting king. May                no  one  of  you  incur  such  a  great  misfortune,  dearest                daughters: be vigilant and faithful brides of your divine groom                (Ibiden)!                         Please stand firm on your good will, and the grace of   520                God will not fail you. The continuous prayers of the brethren                as  well  as  the  exhortations,  the  rules,  and other assistance                will help you; but you must be resolute, strong, and constant.                Do not deceive yourselves by thinking of enjoying satisfaction                and pleasure, but think of embracing penance and sacrifice. If                you wish consolations, these will be the ones coming from the                cross, because the cross has a secret joy... May you be able                to suffer some trouble, opposition, mortification, and sacrifice                for  Jesus,  our  supreme  goodness.  Be  sure  that  the  joy                gushing out of the cross surpasses the world's pleasures; that                the  sacrifices  you  undertake  in  order  to  please  God,  to  be                holy  and  to  save  souls,  include  a  joy  beyond  all                understanding. Most faithful is God, who chose you. He asks                you to carry his cross. He himself places it on your","shoulders. He sometimes overcharges it to make it felt, but if                you are faithful, he will give you the consolations, the joy, and                the  peace  which  are  an  anticipation  of  the  eternal  reward                (Speech, Oct. 24, 1909). (1)                                4. THE DOORS OF DECLINE                      To help the superior to prevent decline, we indicate the                doors  through  which  decline  enters  a  community;  it                sometimes enters through one person by the hellish enemy's                help.                      1.  Neglecting  the  holy  meditation  by  not  sharing  the                morning meditation or by giving up the daily one on the mast                holy  Passion  of  our  Lard  Jesus  Christ,  is  the  first  door  of                decline.  The  faithlessness  in  spiritual  readings  and  the                emission of them also belongs to this door. The superior will                see  to  it  that  the  Religious  attend  the  daily  meditation,  and                when someone is unable to make it in the appointed time, he                will later be provided with a proper time.                521                      2.  Receiving  Holy  Communion  without  the  proper                dispositions is the second doer, somehow hidden, and which                causes  saddest  results,  especially  when  one  receives  the                Eucharist with many defects and voluntary venial sins! When                a  person  commits  voluntary  sins,  gives  bad  examples,  is                distracted, and indifferent; when this person receives the Holy                Communion  in  such  a  state  of  conscience,  be  grows                lukewarm day by day, becomes more unobservant, declines                in  a  short  time,  and  makes  others  follow  his  example.  The                superior  shall  be  very  attentive  that  all  receive  Holy                Communion with the due dispositions of remote preparation -                avoidance  of  voluntary  sins,  even  venial  ones  -  and  of                immediate preparation;","he  wild  see  to  it  that  a  proper  thanksgiving  will  never  be                omitted.                      3.  Lukewarmth  in  the  spirit  of  vocal  prayer. This  is  the                third  door  of  decline.  The  superior  will  prevent  it  by  seeing                that  each  person  says  the  prayers  established  by  the  rule                with a contrite, quiet voice.                      4. The key of the fourth door of decline is in the hands of                the mute devil; this door is the grumbling against the institute,                the  superiors,  and  their  orders.  It  creeps  into  the  people's                souls in order to lead them astray, to make them rebellious,                and  then  hushes  up  everything.  In  such  a  situation  even                those  who  seem  observant  may  hush  up  the  increasing                infractions which they see, or listen to, or know. These people                are  the  institute's  betrayers,  not  the  faithful sons!  How  very                attentive the superior must be! He shall teach and exhort his                subjects on purpose. In case of suspicions, he will question                the  most  faithful  members,  by  asking  them  whether  they                know of any infractions or not. Above all, following our Lord's                suggestion, « Pray and be vigilant » the superior will pray and   522                will be vigilant to prevent the devil from sowing dissension in                the elect harvest. The Holy Spirit tells each superior: « Know                your  flocks'  condition  well,  take  good  care  of  your  herds;                since riches do not last for ever, wealth is not handed down                from age to age » (Prov. 27, 23-24). (2)                      5. To lead everything in perfect observance and to avoid                lukerwarmness in the community, each superior will carefully                correct  the  little  defects,  considering  them  as  momentous.                Woe  to  the  superior  who  begins  neglecting  same  little                defects, passing over them in silence, almost approving them                through  his  silence  and  indifference  or  by  committing  them                himself! Bit by bit, the destroying","fire will be lighted! The superior must remember that the Holy                Spirit says, « He who despises trifles will sink down little by                little  »  (Ecclesiasticus  19,  1).  When  a  person  disregards  a                little  defect,  it  becomes  habitual  gangrene,  increases,  and                pollutes  others,  unless  it  is  corrected.  That person  declines                spiritually,  receives  Holy  Communion  with  indifference,  and                does  not  profit  by  it  as  he  should.  The  grace  of  the  Lord                increases,  temptations  grow,  hidden  passions  rouse  again,                seep  in  the  spirit,  and  try  to  retake  their  place;  distractions                assail the soul, the spirit of prayer dissipates, and that person                falls from the venial sins into the grave ones! This, however,                is not the worst evil! At once, that defect is imitated by others                who  achieve  the  same  results;  the  fire  bursts  into  flames!                Guilty  before  God  for  having  passed  over  his  subjects'                defects, the superior declines first. Punishment results in his                becoming worse than the others, and he is a model of bad                examples  to them! Too many  good,  observant  communities                were ruined this way! The superior, therefore, must prevent                and  repress  the  little  defects  to  ward  off  decline  from  the                community.  He  will  always  remember  that  our  Lord  Jesus                Christ said: « I tell you this: on the judgment day everyone will   523                have  to  give  account  of  every  useless  word  he  has  ever                spoken » (Mt. 12, 36).                      6.  Vocations.  As  to  vocations,  they  are  of  great                importance in warding off lukewarmth and in maintaining the                exact observance in the community. The superiors, therefore,                will  carefully  prevent  the  unproved  vocations  from  entering                the  order.  Keeping  in  mind  that  the  devil  induces  same                persons to enter the institute in order to ruin it, the superiors                will  be  vigilant  and  strong  sentinels  in order  to discover  the                hellish snares and to repel the hellish attacks vigorously.                      7. A big door of decline is angry talk. Meekness and","calm help the hearts to be united in charity, whereas anger                destroys mutual charity. Angry talk is barn of the heart prone                to anger, but hard to mercy. It is, like a polluting disease. Woe                to the superior who is prone to anger and to hateful talk even                about ordinary things. The community will follow his behavior,                destroying the union of hearts! He must be meekest in words                and  action;  even  when  he  raises,  his  voice  to  speak  with                vigor, his heart must be always calm and self-controlled.                      8. Decrease of holy, mutual love is a mast fateful door of                general  decline!  The  superior  will  be  very  attentive  in  this                matter. First, he will love his subjects much, much, much with                tender affection, showing it by facts. He will often remember                what our Lord Jesus Christ said with pressing invitation: « A                new commandment I give you: love one another. As I have                loved you, so you must love one another » (Jn. 13, 34), as                well as: « if you have love for one another, then all will know                that you are my disciples » (Jn. 13, 35). He will foster spiritual                readings on mutual charity, paying attention to the practice of                it. Such practice consists:                                                                          524                     a)  In  sympathizing  and  consoling  the  afflicted  as  much                as obedience allows;                      b) In easing the brother of his burden by helping him;                      c) In rejoicing for the brethren's good;                      d) In praying sincerely for one another, especially when                someone is in danger of losing his virtue or his vocation. The                Religious  who  cries  before  God  to  obtain  grace  for  the                tottering  brother  will  became  most  acceptable,  whereas  the                community's  indifference  before  a  tottering  vocation  is  very                pitiable! In such a case, the superior may","tell the community to pray for an intention, without specifying                it.                      The superior will also take care that love for one another                be  love  of  charity  with  no  personal  sympathy  or  friendship,                but  each  one  will  love  everyone  equally.  He  will  love  all,                especially the needy, and when they are humble in heart, he                will  show  his  love  for  them  publicly.  Love  of  charity  also                consists  in  having  mercy  on  the  sick,  and  in  serving  them                heartily.                      e)  Holy  love  consists  in  bearing  the  faults  of  and  in                excusing  the  brethren,  when  they  give  some  offense.  The                superior will keep a special watch on this topic, which we call                door opened by the devil to weaken the whole community.                      When  a  Religious  is  touchy  by  nature,  unless  he                amends,  he  is  rude  to  others,  or  he  charges  them  of  some                offense,  or  he  is  lacking  in  charity  and  courtesy.  In  such  a                case  the  devil  is  on  the  look-out  to  infuse  indignation  and                grudge in the offended person! Fateful moment! If that person   525                yields  to  the  temptation  by  lack  of  virtue,  the  hearts  are                divided,  and  grumble,  suspicion,  and  bad  example  follow.                Here, the superior will take care of the offended person rather                than of the offender. He will appease him by reminding him of                the holy principles and by praying for him. On the other hand,                he  will  do  his  best  so  that  the  offender  acknowledge  his                wrong and apologize so as to settle everything in peace. We                shave to cut down disorders at their very beginning.                      9. Infringement of silence is another door the devil opens                to slacken and to invade the community. The superior will be                very watchful on it. He first will observe silence perfectly, and                will demand observance of the perfect and of the moderate                silence, and avoid the hellish deceit of","correcting the infringement of silence on the spot by raising                his voice. It would be as to throw straw on the fire to blow it                out.  Instead,  when  he  wants  to  correct  the  infringement  of                silence on the spot, the most suitable and efficacious means                is to demand silence by reproaching by signs, or in a very low                voice.  This  demand  or  reproach  is  also  a  very  effective                example of observance. Morning silence must be observed in                a  special  way,  because  it  gives  the  tune  to  the  whole  day.                Talking before the holy mass and the most Holy Communion                causes dissipation.                      10.  Each  superior  will  see  to  it  that  each  rule  be                observed.  To  avoid  decline,  he  will  be  responsible  for  the                community's  schedule,  will  equip  the  building  to  the  com-                munity's needs, and will provide his subjects with everything                they need to insure neatness and order.                      11. If someone is the cause of decline, the superior will                do  his  best  to  correct  him  gently  or  bluntly,  beginning  with                praying to our Lord and to the most holy Virgin. If at the end,   526                the  Religious  appears  unwilling  to  amend,  the  superior  will                defer the case to the major superior (R.S.).                                            NOTES                     (1) The young sisters must always keep in mind the rules and the                promises they have made. By remembering the retreat where they have                been formed, they will be spiritually united to the mother house, and will                commend the institute and its members to the Lord in order that it may                improve, be firm, and acceptable to God for the greater consolation of                Jesus'  Heart.  While  working  to  educate  the  others,  they  will  strive  to                sanctify  themselves  according  to  the  spirit  of  their  institute,  which                consists in the zeal for the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests. They will                strive to achieve the virtues,","seeking  Jesus  alone  and  longing  for  holy  profession  in                compliance with the will of God... Their behavior and the success of                the orphans depend on their spiritual life. If they behave religiously,                they will be meritorious, and the new house will proceed well; if they                lack virtue, everything will stop progressing, and other persons will                replace them. With the Lord's help, they will be the founders of the                institute  and  the  saviors  of  the  orphans.  Were  they  to  leave  the                practice  of  the  virtues,  or  to  nurture  secret  defects,  or  to  cause                scandal  and  lukewarmness,  they  should  be  guilty  of  serious                damagesl  The  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  and  Immaculate  Mary,  to                whom they will recommend themselves as to their mother superior,                owner, and teacher, forbid it. Amen» (For Taormina's house).                     (2) Our padre will touch upon this topic in chapter XXXI.                                                                                    527","528","CHAPTER XXX                            HELPING THE INSTITUTE DEVELOP                     I  will  always  nurture  a  loving  affection  for  my  own                institute, whose interests I will consider as mine, striving                to  make  it  known  to  the  people.  I  will  also  help  it  to                develop through my feeble capacity, work, sacrifice, and                humble  prayers  as  well  as  by  incessantly  seeking  my                own sanctification of the brethren.                     To  win  good  vocations,  I  will  pray  to  God  and  will                seize the opportunities to attract those according to the                Heart  of  Jesus,  who  are  suited  for  the  Daughters  of                Divine Zeal's institute. I will jealously and faithfully keep                the secrets of the institute and of its members, even In                case I should leave the order for a just reason, just as I                have said above.                                                                            529                   1. LET US RENEW OURSELVES DOING OUR UTMOST                      My little children! God entrusted a great treasure to us!                But, we must fear of being deprived of it, unless we observe                well the religious life.                   The time has come to spread the command of the Rogate;                God entrusted this mission to us. But, we must observe the                religious life, lest this mission perish in our hands. What did l                say?  Will  it  perish?  Not  at  all!  If  we  do  not  observe  thus                religious life, we will perish, but the Rogate will triumph! God                will snatch out of our hands this treasure, and will give it to                others. He will rent the vineyard out to other tenants, who will                give him his share of the harvest at the right time (Mt. 21, 41).                Oh,  little  children!  Haw  can  we  think  of  such  a  misfortune                without","dying  of  pain?  Oh,  we  will  never  became  unworthy  of  so a                great  ineffable  mercy.  To  be  worthy  of  it,  however,  implies                that we must be perfect Religious through the observance of                the  vows  and  the  rules,  because  advertisement  and  pious                union are inadequate if we do not belong totally to Jesus, if                we  do  not  form  an  observant  community  dearest  to  the                Hearts  of  Jesus  and Mary  through  the  practice  of the  vows                and the virtues!                      Unless we are men of prayer, mortified, detached, lovers                of  Jesus  and  Mary  as  well  as  of  the  cross  and  sacrifice;                unless we are sober in words, obedient, observant, and men                of  interior  life,  our  writing,  printing,  and  being  zealous  are                useless. But, if we are observant Religious, God will bless the                little  seed  and  the  vocations  will  come.  Ah,  let  us  renew                ourselves,  doing  our  utmost!  Let  us  say:  Now  I  begin                (Speech, 1908)! (1)                              2. CULTURE OF THE VOCATIONS                   530                      The  order  of  the  Rogationist  Fathers  by  the  Heart  of                Jesus  will  aim  at  winning  holy  vocations  to  religious  and                priestly life for the divine glory, the good of the whole Church,                and for souls.                      To achieve this goal, they will make unceasing petitions                to God in order to win good workers to the holy Church, will                spread this beneficial prayer, and will acknowledge that more                worthy  persons  can  win  this  grace  of  graces,  this  mercy  of                mercies better than they do. While praying for vacations and                while  spreading  the  vocation  prayer,  they  will  have  the                following two intentions:                      First: that the most holy Heart of Jesus create, raise, and                send  out  apostolical  persons,  holy  priests  according  to  his                Heart, and elect workers of the mystical harvest","to the whole Church, to the dioceses, to the religious orders,                and to the sacred congregations.                      Second:  that  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  raise  and                send out blessed youth and priests according to his Heart to                the institute of the Rogationist Fathers by the Heart of Jesus,                as  the  one  to  which the  divine unintelligible mercy and  the,                Spirit that « blows wherever he wishes » (Jn. 3, 8) gave the                understanding  and  the  mission  of  the  divine  word:  «  Pray,                therefore, to the owner of the harvest. »                      The  Rogationists  will  combine  prayers,  intentions,  and                works.  When  qualified  Rogationists  are  available,  and  the                bishops  ask  for  them,  they  will  commit  themselves  to  the                culture and to the education of the clerics in the seminaries,                reputing this work as the best of their ministry.                      To attract holy vocations to the Rogationist institute, the                order will aim at cultivating piety in the youth, at educating the                children  in  Christian  doctrine,  and  at  forming  youth  groups,   531                under the protection of the most holy Heart of Jesus, the most                holy Virgin, St. Joseph, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Louis.                The festive oratories along with play activities, theater, walks                etc. are also a very efficient means, but holy confession and                Communion are the prominent means.                      The order will be very attentive in cultivating its vocations                in the Lord, helping them persevere. The common and private                prayer  of  the  priests  along  with  their  good  example  in                observance  and  practice  of  holy  virtues  helps  the  youth,                because  they  can  hardly  be  formed  when  they  are                surrounded by bad examples and indifference of the chiefs.                Therefore, the order must pay full attention to form the youth                in piety and religious virtues, and will help those of talent to                study to become priests of the order. The superiors will take                care of them, paying heed","that  their  whole  education  be  in  the  institute,  and  will  avoid                sending  them  to  the  seminary's  school  together  with  the                diocesan  clerics.  Do  not  be  hasty  in  ordering  them  priests;                when they have completed their education and are founded                well in religious virtues, then they are ready for the ordination                to  the  priesthood.  The  superiors  will  also  see  that  the                candidates  for  the  priesthood  give  no  priority  to  study  over                piety  and  to  education  over  virtue,  but  base  themselves  on                holy humility, prayer, and internal virtue (C.R.).                      The  chance  of  vocations  from  the  day  school  for  girls                turns out to be very profitable. The drawing of the girls to holy                vacation is surely a pious activity, but the sisters must be very                cautious,  evading  to  pressure  the  girls  even  by  saying  that                the sisters mean to call them to religious life. It would alarm                their  parents.  Such  a  work  is  to  be  done  indirectly  through                spiritual education, piety, and pure holy affection.                      a)  The  spiritual  education  developed  on  the  basis  of                Christian doctrine, sacred history, and spiritual readings leads                to holy vacation indirectly. To teach religion effectively to the   532                girls,  the  sisters  should  attend  four-five  year  courses  of                catechism,  history  criticism,  principles  of  theology,  (2)  and                Sacred  Scripture.  At  the  end  of  the  courses,  a  team  of                learned, pious priests headed by the Ordinary would confer a                diploma  after  the  examination.  Thus,  the  sisters  would  be                qualified to form the students through strong, sound principles                of religion. (3)                      b)  Piety:  the  sisters  will  form  the  Daughters  of  Im-                maculate  Mary's  pious  union  and  will  be  responsible  for  it,                because  various  vocations  may  rise  spontaneously  when  it                flourishes. The reception of the sacraments, especially of the                Holy Communion with the due dispositions","and  thanksgiving,  the  readings  from  ascetic  books,  the                meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  on                the last truths, the devotions in the months of May and June,                the  feasts  of  our  Lord  and  the  most  holy  Virgin,  etc...  raise                vocations without fail!                      c)  Affection:  the  sisters'  pure,  holy  love  for  the  girls                exercises  a  potent  influence  on  them  to  follow  the  same                vocation, because love tends by itself to make lovers alike; a                girl  who  is  loved  in  a  holy  manner  by  the  sisters  aims  at                becoming like them.                      Vocations from the orphans. The sisters will never speak                of  vocation  to  the  orphans  in  order  to  attract  them  to                becoming  sisters,  on  the  contrary  they  will  say  indirectly  to                the orphans that they would be unworthy of it. If someone of                the  orphans  shows  signs  of  vocation,  the  sister  will  not                cultivate it immediately, but will let it develop by itself, praying                to the Lord. When a wise, pious, good natured, meek orphan                is  detached  from  the  relatives  and  from  the  world  and  is                affectionate to the institute; when she is introduced well in the   533                study and the works, and shows signs of vocation, the sisters                will  pray  and  take  advice  before  submitting the  case  to  the                mother general in order to receive the orphan in the religious                community.                             3. DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORDER                      The mother superior will carefully form the sisters' spirit                and mind to improve their skill in good works, the execution,                of  their  office,  and  everything  that  helps  them  to  become                perfect sisters.                      The  mother  superior  must  be  convinced  that  when  the                spiritual, intellectual, and domestic formation is well done, our                Lord continues sending good vocations, because","the institute becomes an ark of salvation and of sanctification                for the congregants. When the vocations grow in number and                the  youth  are  well  formed,  they  will  be  ready  for  new                foundations, avoiding to wish them for ambition, levity, vanity,                and  vainglory,  which  would  prevent  the  Lord  from  blessing                them.                      Ready as soldiers at the command of the headquarter,                the mother superior and the sisters will be ready to found new                communities when the will of the Lord manifests itself. They                will  work  in  the  holy  Church  and  in  the  mystical  harvest  of                God for the divine glory, for the consolation of the most holy                Heart of Jesus, and for the salvation of souls.                      When we are invited to found a new house, the invitation                must be, somehow delayed by writing and re-writing in order                to  know  the  necessary  information  about  the  distance,  the                means of communication, the country or the city, the place,                what the people offer and demand, the income they promise,                etc.; we must know beforehand what is necessary to the new                house before giving our definite answer.                  534                      After  obtaining  the  information,  the  sisters  need  some                more  time  for  prayer;  therefore,  the  community  will  begin                novenas, prayers, and celebration of masses for a least one                month.                      To  check  the  written  information,  the  superior  or  two                experienced sisters will go to see the place of the foundation.                If  they  consider  the  proposal  acceptable,  they  may  give  a                favorable  opinion  to  the  persons  responsible  for  the                foundation, without entering into any engagement. Once back                home, they will report everything to the mother superior.                      When  by  divine  help  the  new  house  may  start  and  be                promising, the council gathers again to discuss the","proposal and the convention in order to find out the best way                to achieve the aim of the foundation.                      Before accepting a house, the superiors have to form an                idea of the actual and of the eventual income for the sisters'                livelihood and for the maintenance of the house, considering                the furniture, the remodeling, the laboratories, etc.                      Fixed income for the whole maintenance of the orphans                cannot be claimed, because we have to fulfill the gap by work                and divine providence, in which we have to trust. On the other                hand, we won't tempt God by founding orphanages in places                where,  humanly  speaking,  there  is  little  or  no  hope  to                succeed. We must follow the right middle way in everything.                      As for the day schools, which require four or five sisters,                their  foundation  and  maintenance  are  easier,  unless  the                buildings  are  unsuitable;  in  such  a  case,  remodeling,                enlargement,  and  the  like  must  be  taken  into  consideration                before making the contract.                                                                          535                     While  considering  the  environmental  suitability  for  the                foundation's success, you have also to think of the institutions                already existent  in  that  place,  which  live by contributions.  If                the people are committed to them, it would be unwise to put                an additional institution without having some sure income.                      Can foundations be started without invitation? Of course                they  can,  they  even  should  when  qualified  sisters  had  at                disposal  financial  means  to  buy  suitable  buildings,  to  open                schools or laboratories in cities or towns, to receive orphans,                etc. On the contrary case it is better waiting for an invitation in                order  to  profit  by  convenient  terms;  nevertheless,  if  despite                our good will and trust in divine providence we are notable to                meet the request, the invitation is to be declined.","When an orphanage ends its activity, the sisters will do                their best to take the orphans, at least the more affectionate                and promising, to other orphanages of the order. If children                are all good, the sisters will provide to take them all.                                  4. WHICH FOUNDATIONS                      Which  foundations  can  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal                foster?                      The  sacred,  expressive  name  of  Daughters  of  Divine                Zeal  compels  us  to  promote  the  divine  Heart  of  Jesus'                interests,  that  is  to  say,  whatsoever  charitable  institution,                because  the  zeal  is  the  charity's  fervor.  As  special  sup-                porters of the divine command: « Pray, therefore, etc., » by                God's  help  and  our  good  will  we  have  to  be  energetic                workers in the mystical harvest, in any field of the spiritual                and temporal culture in order to win souls to the most holy                Heart of Jesus for his glory and consolation.                                                                          536                      The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  can  open  orphanages,                kindergartens,  asylums  for  the  poor,  hospitals,  laboratories                for  outside  students,  any  charitable  foundation  for  girls,                boarding  schools  from  elementary  schools  to  colleges,                depending on their financial means and on the number of the                qualified sisters.                      Do we exclude the foundations in little towns?                      Suppose that an orphanage or day school in a little town                is  guaranteed  by  means  or  by  development  of  work  and                industries. The foundation should be preferred, even though                the little town may have another institution which is not run by                sisters.  Our  Lord  wants  us  to  operate  for  the  good  of  the                souls who are more in need, and perhaps more docile, than                those who live in big cities or are daughters to the great of                this world.","We repeat: we must avoid seeking to found any house                by ambition, seeking big cities for a worldly reputation or for                large  profits;  on  the  contrary,  we  must  work  for  our  Lord                Jesus Christ's glory and for the poor who are riot cared for by                other institutions. Do the missionary sisters go to the infidels'                lands  for  their  oven  convenience?  A  foundation  which                operates  in  a humble,  poor  town  is  a  true mission  pleasing                the good shepherd Jesus, who seeks here and there, on the                mountains and in the fields the dispersed abandoned sheep,                which  are  easy  prey  for  the  hellish  wolves.  If  the  sisters  of                such  a  foundation  are  faithful  to  their  vocation  and  rule,                always  living  in  the  original  fervor  and  in  the  spirit  of                sanctification, improving themselves and the souls entrusted                to them, these sisters will be blessed and be helped by the                Lord.                      Both the mother superior and the superior general must                pay careful attention to all this.                             5. CHRONICLE OF THE HOUSE AND                  537                               OF THE DIVINE BENEFITS                      Each house will write its own chronicle in a special book,                beginning with its foundation, with the plans, and everything                preceding  the  formal  entrance  of  the  community  in  it.  The                chronicle  will  describe  the  entrance,  the  number  of  the                sisters, and their first acquaintances. Then, the daybook will                register  any  event,  such  as:  change  of  things,  the  granted                graces,  the  notable  visits,  the  troubles,  the  transfer  of  the                sisters  or  vocations,  and  anything  worth  mentioning.  When                nothing special occurred, the writer will write after the date:                ordinary course of business or the contracted form O. C. B.                The  historiographer  will  pay  attention  to  date  any  event,                sometimes","recording  even  the  hours,  abut  everything  will  be  narrated                briefly,  the  special  events  excepted.  The  chronicle  of  the                house is a coefficient of the house's existence. Outstanding                actions of virtues will be also recorded.                       The mother  superior  will  spay  careful  attention  that  the                historiographer record the special graces, the divine mercies,                and the spiritual or temporal benefits concerning the house.                She  can  do  it  in  the  same  book  or  in  another  one.  If  the                record is taken .in the chronicle of the house, the record will                be headed by the title: divine Mercy or Divine Grace or Divine                Benefit. The historiographer will record the granted graces in                details,  and  will  write  the  date.  At  the  end  of  the  year,  the                records  of  the  special  graces  will  be  read  during  the                thanksgiving  triduo.  It  is  praiseworthy  to  record  the  divine                benefits in a special book. In such a case, the special grace                will be recorded so: « Today, special grace from the Lord, see                book of the divine benefits, year... page... »                      The records must be preserved jealously in the archives   538                to be at the disposal of our institute's future generations; thus,                the  present  and  the  future  houses  will  nurture  great,                continuous gratitude to the divine infinite goodness not only                for  the  general  but  also  for  the  special  graces  which  were                granted to each house. Likewise, following her devotion, each                sister will record or keep in mind the memories of the special                graces, for which she feels obliged toward the divine amorous                lover, Jesus (S.D.D.Z.).                      Some  events,  or  special  graces,  or  preservations  from                perils  and  evils  must  be  remembered  during  the  year.  The                commemoration will be done this way: the notable events will                be written in the calendar, and will be read at refectory on the                eve of their anniversary (S.D.D.Z.). (4)","6. THE ROGATIONIST BULLETIN                      Every  two  or  three  months,  the  priests  residing  at  the                mother house in Messina publish a Bulletin to keep alive and                foster the interest for the institute through the remark of the                main  events  and  through  the  remembrance  of  the  sacred                memories and the particular traditions. It would be unpleasant                if the houses gave little regard to the bulletin that the young                priests  are running  with  love,  labor,  and  sacrifice  under  the                wise guide of our most Rev. Canon Vitale. For that reason we                exhort  the  mother  superior  or  vicar  of  each  house  and                dependencies to make the religious community read it in the                most  suitable  time;  the  orphans  will  not  share  this  reading.                We  exhort  to  pay  a  full  attention  to  it,  nurturing  an  always                more  affection  to  our  institute  that  the  Lord  has  blessed  in                many ways. We are sure that the Lord will do even more, on                condition that all of us are faithful, which we want for ever at                the cost of our blood and life.                      To  foster  fervor  and  union  among  the  houses,  each                house may report; to the bulletin its main events, the mercies   539                of the Lord, the good results, the new developments, and the                like (Circular, Jan. 1925).                                             NOTES                    (1) «The order is made of priests and lay-brothers living under the                same rule and with the same advantages, but with different duties.                    As members of the same religious family, the lay-brothers are to be                esteemed  as  much  as  the  priests,  profiting  by  the  same  spiritual  and                temporal goods. Save the personal fulfillment of duty, they will share the                acts in common, but in places different from the ones assigned to the                priests. The lay-brothers will be humble and will glory in serving all of the                Lord's  house,  accomplishing  their  duty  with  care  and  applying                themselves to arts and crafts. If someone is","inclined to fine arts  or  to  mechanics, he  will cultivate  them  in  the                Lord,  because  fine  arts  are  the  splendor  of  the  religious  garb,  and                mechanics is of great help to the institute. As to music, the lay brothers                will  not study  it without  a special  permission,  which  will be  granted  in                exceptional cases* (C.R.).                    (2)  Regarding   this   subject,   our   padre   wrote:    «St.   Thomas'                Summa  Teologica,  traslated  into  Italian  and  summarized  in  questions                and answers, Marietti edition, Turin, may be of help.»                    (3)  Today, school of religion for the sisters is obligatory; it was not                in our padre's time. He was a forerunner.                    (4)  After   noting  defaults   on   this   matter,   our   padre   wrote                a circular on July 14, 1915, saying that he was «obliged to command by                obedience    a      topic  of    importance    for    the    moral    quality    of      a                religious  foundation.»  He  continued:  «It  is  long  since  I  am  recom-                mending to write the house chronicle and it has never been made; now                I  command  the   mother  superior of  this   house  or  her  vicar to                prepare  a  book  of  foolscap  paper,»  to  date  it  and  to  write  the  story,                following these rules:                    1)  As to the  present  chronicle, the mother superior herself or a                sister will write the daily events before going to sleep.                    2)  As  to  the   past   chronicle,   the   mother  superior  will   gather,                note, and write the chief events of the  house  beginning  from  the time                of  its foundation. She  may question  the sisters who  are acquainted                whit it.                                                  540                    3)  Please write the date of the past events precisely.                    4)    Leaving  out  present  and  past  trifles,  write  the  chief  events;                meantime  each  sister  will  pray  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  to  give  her                enlightenment.                    The Daughters of the Sacred Side of Jesus were also told to write                the house chronicle.                    « I warmly recommend the chronicle of the house. Write it as soon                as  possible,  noting  its  foundation  date,  its  progress,  difficulties,                tribulations, persecutions, and want. Write the sisters by their full name,                the  transfer  of  directions,  the  day  school  along  With  Its  fortunes,  the                taking  of  the  habit,  and  everything  until  you  up-date  it.  Later, you will                write the chief events of every week. When I call upon you by the Lord's                help, you will let me read it. Please use a filing cabinet for documents,                titles,  mains  letters,  notes,  etc.  All  these  things  form  the  houses,  and                God blesses them because he likes order» (D.S.S.).","CHAPTER XXXI                                      INFORMATION                      I  recognize  as  exact  and  indispensable  the  institute's                rule that demands of the congregants to faithfully refer to the                superiors  the  brethren's  defects  and  anything  which  is                spiritually or materially harmful to even one person. For that                reason I promise to be most faithful in referring everything to                the  superiors,  but  when  the  matter  is  about  the  brethren's                defects, I will observe these rules:                      1. I wild refer the serious defects and the habitual ones,                either  hidden  or  unobserved,  even  though  they  are  not                serious.                      2.  When  I  am  able  to  remedy  the  brethren's  hidden,                irrelevant, unobserved defects, I will do it through the humble                brotherly correction once or twice. If I do not succeed in it, I                will refer it to the superior.                                                                          541                     3. I will never inform for personal reasons or for grudge,                but  for  charity  and  with  pure  intention,  avoiding                over-statements or addition.                      As to the rule of information, I will do my duty regardless                of  human respect,  or  fear  of  displeasing  the  brother  and  of                losing his affection and esteem. (1)                      The aspirants are not allowed to charge each other with                personal  trifles,  but  are  obliged  by  obedience  to  give                information  to  the  superior  in  these  two  following  cases:  1)                when  they  know  something  which  is  harmful  to  the                community or to a person; 2) when they are questioned","by the superior about  conversations or facts they may have                about others in question.                      These rules are so important that the aspirant who does                not inform the superior about anything which hiddenly harms                the persons or the institute, will be considered as an unfaithful                traitor,  because  he  hushes  up  in  agreement  with  the  devil,                allowing the trouble to grow in proportion. If a youth conceals                something to the superior who questions him, he is no longer                an  aspirant  to  religious  life,  but  an  aspirant  to  a  gang  of                malefactors,  and  is  worthy  of  being  punished  with  rigor                immediately,  and  even  of  being  expelled.  The  aspirants,                therefore, are obliged to answer sincerely to the superior, and                when  they  know  of  infractions  of  rules  and obligations  they                are bound an duty to inform him (R.A.). (2)                      The  congregants'  duty  to  faithfully  refer  to  the  superior                the serious inconveniences that might harm the community or                even  one  person  is  a  chief  point  of  discipline.  The                probationers  must  know  that  when  the  hellish  enemy  plots                against the people, he demands perfect silence: this is what   542                we call the mute devil. Charity instead urges us to inform the                superior,  who  is  able  and  must  remedy  the  situation.  The                information,  however,  must  be  done  with  charity  and  with                purest intention. Light violations of this rule, which can cause                serious damage, are considered serious inconveniences. If a                probationer  comes  to  know  that  he  has  been  charged  with                something, he must not become angry nor complain. Getting                angry  or  complaining  about  such  a  matter  is  a  symptom  of                deplorable obstinacy in one's own makeup; on the contrary,                he  must  be  grateful  toward  the  people  who  informed  the                superior (R.P.).                      Each congregant is strictly obliged to faithfully inform the                superiors about any infraction in the community, any damage                even to one person, the fellow's defect which","harms him or others, as well as any temptation of decline or                defection. Everything must be referred faithfully; whoever                keeps silent about these cases, is a traitor of his own                religious family.                       The informer will act for charity's sake as well as for the                fellow's  and  for  the  whole  community's  good,  but  never  for                personal  reason.  If  the  fellow  who  is  charged  happens  to                know the informer, he must be grateful to him, and will even                take  pleasure  in  what  he  did;  were  he  to  do  otherwise,  he                would show no religious spirit. But, the superior will act with                greatest prudence to let the informer remain unknown, while                acting quickly and strongly to remedy the situation (C.R.).                      Each  novice  is  obliged  by  obedience  to  inform  the                mother  superior  about  another's  defects  and  also about  the                students' actions that require correction. The breaker of this                rule  is  guilty  of  disobedience.  Only  when  the  matter  is  a                personal offense, the offended novice may be more reserved.                As  for  light  faults,  the  novice  may  use  once  or  twice  the   543                charitable advice, and the novice who is advised will behave                humbly.  If  he  refuses  the  correction,  the  duty  to  inform  the                mother  superior  remains.  The  informer,  who  complies  with                holy obedience in such a case, must behave charitably, only                aiming  at  helping  the  offending  person  and  the  whole                community. The novices are recommended to take the rule of                information do good part, avoiding any complaint about each                other  and  being  mutually  grateful,  because  the  rule  of                information is for their good (R.L.P.).                      By  informing  the  superior,  people  do  not  offend  holy                charity.  On  the  contrary,  people  offend  justice,  obedience,                and  charity  by  not  informing  the  superior  (Letter,  April  1,                1912).                      Be sure that the leader of a community is practicing","charity  when  he  expels  the  subversive;  on  the  contrary,  he                offends charity when he hesitates to expel them (Letter, May                23, 1913).                                           NOTES                    (1)  To   prevail   over   the   mute   devil,   our   padre   ordered                the following prayer to the most holy Virgin: «O divine, lovable, invisible,                absolute,   immediate   mother   superior,   Immaculate   Mary,   kneeling                at your foot, I humbly beg you to forgive me for all the times I was won                by the mute devil to my own and to others' prejudice, because I did  not                inform  the superiors.  O  most  holy Virgin,  I  promise  that I will never                do so again; regardless of human respect  I will inform our padre (or the                mother superior or the teacher)   about anything which  is harmful  to the                individuals  or to  the  community.  0   most holy  Mother,  please  help                me   prevail  over  the   mute  devil  when   I have to talk to the superiors                or when I have to be silent with my fellow Religious.  Hail  Mary.»                    (2)   «Knowing  that  the  institute's  rule   commands  us  to  inform                   the mother superior about the defects of others as well as anything                   which is harmful to the community or to any  person,  I  promise to                  conceal  nothing,  being  most faithful  in  referring everything for  the                  individuals   and   the   community's   sake.   When   I   am   charged                 with something, I will consider it as a great favor, because my brothers                are  providin  me  with   the  appropriate  admonitions   and   corrections.   544                  J will also consider these  brothers as  my guardian  angels,  praying                  that  they  may  inform  the  mother  superior of   the  teacher for  my                              correction and for God's sake* (D.P.).","CHAPTER XXXII                          RELATIONS AMONG THE INSTITUTE'S                                 CLASSES OF PEOPLE                      Since  the  Institute  has  several  classes  of  persons,                such as the priests, the brothers, the students, and the                orphans,  I  promise  to communicate  with these persons                within  the  bounds  of  the  office  to  which  I  will  be                appointed by the superiors.                      I will avoid meddling with matters concerning these                persons or their office without a legitimate authorization.                       When  an  orphanage  or  a  school  or  a  laboratory  is                connected with the institute, or groups of girls gather within it,                I  will  have  no  relationship  with  the  outside  girls  or  with  the                orphans or with the students or with the apprentices, and the                like.  Even  when  I  am  obliged  to  stay  near  them,  I  will  not   545                watch, nor will I talk, nor will I give them gifts or souvenirs; nor                will I let them give me messages or will I take errands. When                someone tries to do so, I will warn her; if the same person                tries to do so again, I will warn and repulse her, threatening                her with informing the mother superior; if she persists, I will                inform the mother superior or the master (D.P.).","546","CHAPTER XXXIII                              DISCIPLINARY OBSERVANCE                     I will not receive persons, acquaintances, and friends                in  the  Institute  without  the  permission,  at  least                presumed, of the superiors. I will also ask the permission                of the superior to leave. While outside the Institute, I will                avoid speaking Idly with other persons, or calling upon                Individuals without the permission of the superiors, or at                least without informing them.                     When I am walking or interacting with people, I will                avoid curiosity, idle talk, and everything not edifying; on                the  contrary,  I  will  be  always  In  the  presence  of  God,                behaving as a priest and as a Religious.                       1.   DISCIPLINE, SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY                                                                          547                     I  recommend  you  to  be  fond  of  discipline,  because  it                supports  the  community,  and  no  community  can  progress                without  it.  Discipline  means  observance  of  the  rules,  of  the                schedule, and of the silence! Rule, Schedule, Silence. What a                responsibility  they  take  upon  themselves  those  daughters                who  disregard  discipline,  causing  others  to  do  the  same!                From now on, each of you may be like a bee making honey in                silence. Purposely, recommend yourselves to the most holy                Virgin Mary and to your father and patron St. Joseph (Letter,                May 13, 1889).                      May  no  one  disregard  the  community's  duties.  If                someone is at fault or is late for a good reason, he will go to                the assistant to apologize (R.A.).","Be not moved by tenderness or by inopportune piety for                X, because I doubt that this person will succeed. Let us pray                and  be  vigilant,  letting  me  know  her  behavior.  Please                encourage and treat her with true charity, but demand her to                behave! In the community we must seek the common more                than the individual good. It is better to be few in number and                good,  than  having  false  vocations,  which  ruin  the                communities (Letter, Aug. 14, 1913).                      Discipline  means  perfect  obedience.  Obedience!  To                become dear to God and to the people, and to become worth                advancing  in religious  Life, the  aspirant  has  to  practice  this                virtue.                      An  aspirant  must  not  seek  to escape  the  obedience  of                the immediate superior under the pretext of the absent major                superiors' obedience. He must subject himself to the present                one, and follow his decision, because it is he who takes over                the responsibility (R.A.).                      The Daughters of Divine Zeal will obey every article of   548                their rule as if they were the legitimate superiors' voice, and                will  participate  in  the  acts  in  common,  which  are  usually                announced by the bell's chime. The Daughters of Divine Zeal                will do nothing without obedience, not even drinking a cup of                water between meals (C.D.D.Z.).                      The practice of obedience is also a practice of religious                discipline, which must be performed in everything. No one by                arbitrary initiative can give an obedience, or a command, or a                commission  to  others  without  agreeing  beforehand  with  the                superior;  those  who  are  aware  of  such  undue  orders,  or                commissions, will not obey. In little things, however, one can                help  by  charity.  Also  the  fulfillment  of  the  office  belongs  to                discipline (C.R.).                      St. Joseph Little Retreat novices will not be fond of going                to the parlor, but will go only when necessary. When obliged                by necessity, they will do so expeditiously. If the","novices  go  to  the  parlor  without  permission,  or  without  a                chaperon, they commit a serious fault.                 When  a  novice  is  sent  to  the  parlor,  she  will  invoke  Jesus                Christ our Lord, asking him for help before going there. She                will also see to it that her speech be edifying, exhorting the                persons she meets to do good, and avoiding to speak about                the private affairs of the community to the outsiders (R.L.P.).                (1)                         During  the  play  activities,  the  aspirants  will  avoid                causing  any  disorder,  laying  hands  on  others,  saying                offensive  words,  talking  secretly  (what  is  forbidden  in  any                time), and leaving without permission (R.A.).                            A modest, joyous, daily recreation is necessary for the                sisters. They are exhorted to be always cheerful, driving away                sadness  and  melancholy.  No  one  will  cry  for  trifles,  but  will                keep their tears for serious motives, such as: for our Lord, for                the holy Church, for its needs, and for the whole humankind!   549                During  play  activities,  joy  and  holy  happiness  have  to                transpire in order that all may praise and bless the Lord; and                yet, they will beware of immoderate splay (D.S.C.). (2)                               2. DISCIPLINE AND OBEDIENCE                         The first virtue the aspirants must practice is perfect                subordination  not  only  to  the  chief  superior's  authority  but                also to the minor superiors, and especially to the immediate                one, whoever the may be.                         This  subordination  must  be  humble  and  perfect  in                any  case  and  circumstance;  therefore,  if  the  aspirants  are                warned or admonished, they will listen humbly, bowing their                head  eyes  downcast  and  keeping  silence.  During  the                reprehension  they  cannot  apologize,  unless  the  superior                requires it or they themselves ask, and are granted it. In","either  case,  the  aspirants  will  do  it  in  a  low  voice,  fine                manners, and once. If their apology is refused, they will not                reply, but will receive the reprehension in silence, saying at                the end of the reprehension: « I am at fault and wrong; I will                never do it again, » which deserves great merit. If they do not                say  it  at  the  end  of  the  reprehension,  they  will  do  so  later,                after  retiring  into  themselves.  During  the  reprehension,  any                emotional sign such as anger, annoyance, or amusement is                considered a serious insubordination.                      What we have said of the reprehension is also true of the                orders. To oppose them with replying, or with being agitated,                or  with  murmuring,  is  a  serious  fault  of  insubordination.  An                aspirant  behaving  so,  shows  that  he  is  full  of  pride.  If                penances or punishments are given, they must be accepted                humbly and submissively.                      When the aspirant receives penances or is corrected, he                has  to  combine  external  with  internal  humility  and                submission, acknowledging before God that he deserves the                reprehension or the punishment, because reprehension and   550                punishment are given to him for his good.                     Unless  he has  these  interior  dispositions,  he  will  never                improve, because the Holy Spirit says: « Taking pleasure in                evil earns condemnation » (Eccl. 19, 5).                      Discipline  builds  up  order,  peace,  and  wealth;  lack  of                discipline  turns everything  upside dawn... The  aspirants  will                refrain from commanding and obeying each other, because it                is  against  discipline,  save  particular  momentary  cases  in                which  the  petitioner  will  say:  Please...  No  one  will  interfere                with the ether's office. The aspirants are forbidden to speak to                each other of things that happened before their entrance in                the institute as well as to refer to words or events regarding                their  parents,  who  came  to  the  parlor,  or  who  wrote  letters                (R.A.).","The practice of obedience implies perfect discipline; it is                useful,  therefore,  to  touch  upon  some  disciplinary  points,                because  the  community  founds  its  orderly  life  on  the                observance of them.                     Regular  discipline  demands  perfect  observance  of  the                rule. To be exact in discipline, the probationers must keep in                mind the rule by reading part of it every day of the week; they                will pay serious attention to it, and will make an examination                of  conscience  on  their  faults,  repenting  and  making                resolutions.                     The  actions  in  common  belong  to  discipline,  and  are                announced  by  the  bell's  chime,  which  is  the  voice  of                obedience  for  the  probationers.  Remembering  the  words  of                the  apostle:  «  Everything  must  be  done  in  a  proper  and                orderly way » (Cor. 14, 40), as well as St. Ambrose's saying:                «  The  Spirit  does  not  knave  ill-timed  things  »,  the                probationers will not waste time between the various actions,                because  time  is  most  precious.  Passing  from  one  place  to                another,  the  probationers  will  proceed  modestly  by  two   551                (P.R.P.).                     For external discipline we mean the practical rules which                regulate the actions of the community and of its members.                     a)  Schedule:  The  community  needs  to  perform  the                actions in common on fixed time, and when the schedule has                been  established,  it  must  be  observed.  Modifications                according  to  seasons  and  circumstances  may  be  made  by                the  mother  superior;  for  remarkable  things,  however,  the                major superior's advice is required.                     b) Actions in common are the ones the members perform                together,  such  as:  reveille,  meditation,  mass,  refectory,                recreation activities, and the like. No one can pass over the                actions in common without the mother superior's permission,                who will grant it for legitimate reasons. The bell's chime will                be like the voice of obedience (D.S.S.).","3. THE SUPERIOR MUST BE VIGILANT                      The  superior  will  be  the  first  in  the  observance  of  the                actions  in  common,  such  as:  reveille,  meditation,  schedule,                silence,  work,  and  everything;  but  due  to  visits,  audiences,                and business, he may depart from the schedule. But, he will                pay careful attention to establish good example, and will pray                to succeed in it, business notwithstanding. Our Lord will help                him to participate in the actions in common, and when he is                unable,  his  involuntary  absence  will  not  damage,  nor  will  it                establish bad example. When his absence is due to sickness,                the  superior  will  not  let  himself  be  won  by  temptation.  A                person full of faith and zeal can participate in the actions in                common, at least partially, even when he is feverish; the good                Jesus  will  give  a  helping  hand!  In  such  cases,  the  subjects                themselves will ask the superior for exemption. We, however,                do not want the superior to observe all the actions in common                even  when  he  is  sick,  but  we  are  exhorting  him  to  behave                according  to  faith,  zeal,  trust  in  Jesus,  sacrifice,  and                prudence. When he is forced to be bedridden, never mind! He                will  participate  in  the  actions  in  common  after  healing.   552                Meanwhile,  he  will  pray  to  Jesus  for  help  in  order  to                participate  in  the  actions  in  common,  and  Jesus  will  see  to                this important matter of his glory (R.S.).                      Each  superior  will  foster  the  spiritual  progress  of  the                community  entrusted  to  him  by  taking  care  of  the  various                groups and of the whole community. This will be the tap list                interest. He will carefully strive to prevent lukewarmness from                influencing the community, especially in the religious actions,                in the meditation, and in the reception of the sacraments. He                will  be  most  vigilant  to  prevent  the  community  from                committing even a tight deliberate sin, and will take care of                the persons entrusted to him as the","most cherished, knowing that he is responsible for them, and                will give an account to the Lord (R.S.).                         So  that  no  rule  falls  into  disuse,  the  superior  will                demand  observance  of  all  of  them,  seeing  also  that  the                institute's  uses  and  customs,  especially  the  feasts  and  the                religious  practices  be  observed.  He  will  have  at  heart  the                sacred decorous worship of God, the veneration of the most                holy Virgin, and of the saints, as well as the practices of piety                and  the  religious  virtues,  such  as:  humility,  obedience,  and                mortification. He will teach the people the love for Jesus and                Mary,  detachment,  mutual  charity,  and  piety  along  with  the                spiritual and temporal love for neighbor.                         Each  superior  will  bear  in  mind  that  without  God's                blessing  nothing  succeeds,  nothing  improves,  and  that  God                blesses  only  when  he  is  worshipped  and  loved,  when  the                community is guided and cultivated well. In such a case the                Lord's blessings pour out on that community, which will bloom                spiritually  and  temporally,  because  the  most  holy  Heart  of   553                Jesus  is  also  infinitely  effusive  and  generous  with  temporal                wealth, when the goods are directed to his glory (R.S.).

When                convenience or necessity obliges them to go, they will beware of wasting                time by prolonging the visit. Time is so precious that not even a moment                must be wasted. The sisters will regulate both the time and the speech                according to the persons and to the circumstances. As to the strictest                relations's  visit,  the  sister  listener  will  not  allow  worldly  talks.  While                talking  with  her  parents,  either  the  sister  or  the  probationer  will  be                edifying,  exhorting  them  to  attend  the  sacraments  and  to  do  good.                Young  men  are  not  allowed  to  visit  the  house.  If  young  ladies  dress                immodestly, they will politely","be given veils. When authorities or benefactors call upon the house,                they will  be welcomed  even with drinks,  etc.»   (S.D.D.Z.).                    (2)   «The  Little  Retreat  novices will   not  be  fond  of  going  out:                when they have to, they will leave in little groups in order to avoid the                people's   attention.   Walking   modestly,   they   will   avoid   talking with                other  people,  and  will  greet  others  seldom;  for  instance,  if  the  sisters                meet priests, they will  make a   little  bow only. Should  they go to some                house with  the  mother superior's  permission,  they will behave with                fine  manners,  maikng  the  people feel  the presence  of Jesus Christ»                (R.L.P.).                    (3)      «I      warmly      recommend      the      superiors      and      the                counselors to keep secret the decisions, the defects of  the Religious,                and  the inconveniences   which   must   remain   unknown.   When   a                person   is prone   to  say   such   things,   he   shows   levity,   of   which                we   must beware »  (R.S.).                                                                                    554","CHAPTER XXXIV                                    PARTISAN SPIRIT                      I will avoid the partisan spirit as a pestilence, as the                beginning  of  the  institute's  full  ruin.  If  I  perceive  it                appearing,  I  will  fight  it  through  good  exhortation,                example, sacrifice, and by resorting to the superiors.                      When  I  have  to  vote  on  some  report  or  on  the                institute's business, I will pray fervently and will ponder                the  matter;  then  I  will  vote  honestly  in  the  presence  of                God,  avoiding  the  partisan  spirit,  human  respect,  and                personal motives. I entreat the most holy Hearts of Jesus                and  Mary  to  free  me  and  my  brethren  in  Jesus  Christ                from the partisan spirit.                      Because this institute may open several houses with the                Lord's  blessing,  the  sisters  will  branch  off  to  form  various                centers of ruling communities. With all my heart and for our                Lord  Jesus  Christ's  innermost  feelings  I  exhort  St.  Joseph   555                Retreat sisters to never separate themselves spiritually from                each  other,  since  the  spiritual  separation  ruins  the  institute.                They  must  remain  united  in  the  spirit  through  the  mutual                bonds of charity, help, and support, as members of the same                body. May they stand aloof from the partisan spirit in order to                form  one  mind  and  one  heart  by  praying  for  each  other.  I                warmly  recommend  this  rule  to  the  sisters,  because  their                existence and progress depend on its observance (C.D.D.Z.).                      A most malignant evil to be avoided is the partisan spirit                as  the  one  which  ruins  any  religious  community,  old  and                observant as it may be. Woe, if two or three agree secretly or                clearly  to  oppose  authority,  speaking  ill  of  the  brethren,                grumbling, disapproving, plotting, and winning","followers. By so doing, various parties rise, and they confirm                the  gospel's  saying:    «  A  family  divided  against  itself  falls                apart » (Lk. 11, 17). The observance of the rule, the practice                of  the  virtues,  and  the  avoidance  of  contradiction  help  to                maintain the union of hearts. We must follow the counsel of                the Holy Spirit: « Avoid stupid arguments... and fights » (Tit.                3, 9). (C.R.).                      The formation of parties opens a fateful door to the devil,                who  does  not  aim  at  the  decline,  but  at  the  full  ruin  of  a                community! The superior will carefully prevent it at any cost.                Grumbles, grudges, and partiality cause the formation of the                parties. Partialities or bad direction by the superior may also                cause their ruse. Therefore, he will be most vigilant to avoid                it,  and  will  pray  and  act  to  blow  out  this  fire  from  its  very                beginning.                      Caution. The superior must avoid giving a name to what                does not exist, or is feared to exist, or is rising. For instance,                when the party does not exist, but the superior is fearful of its   556                rising, he must beware of pronouncing the word party even                while  he  is  remedying  some  inconvenience.  The  only                utterance  of  the  noun  party  could  cause  its rising,  because                the  names  have  a  great  power  of  creating  ideas.  Prudence                demands of the superior to blow out the spark without making                a  noise,  as  well  as  without  scolding,  admonishing,  and                pointing to what he fears.                      This  is  also  true  for  jealousy.  To  avoid  its  rising,  or  to                make it die at its rising, it is better not to mention it (R.S.).","CHAPTER XXXV                            HOLY INDIFFERENCE TO TRANSFER                      I will not be attached to any house or person of the                Institute; but, in spiritual freedom I will be always ready                to  transfer  to  any  house  and  to  accept  any  office  to                which  I  will  be  appointed,  seeking  God  alone  and  the                good of the order.                      Since the institute has already several houses and it is                likely to found others with the Lord's help, I declare that I am                ready  to  transfer  to  any  of  them,  even  when  I  do  not  know                why,  if  obedience  demands  that of  me.  I  will  live  happily  in                any community, as in the mother-house, by observing these                promises and protestations.  When  I  have  a good  reason  to                humbly ask the superiors for transferring me or for going into                retirement,  I  will  keep  calm  even  if  the  superiors  deny  my                request. If through deliberate misbehavior I happen to force                the superiors to retire me, I agree that I would be at fault with   557                faithfulness  toward  God  and  obedience,  becoming  an                unworthy Religious who sets bad example by placing herself                under  the  devil's  obedience;  therefore,  I  would  deserve  the                expulsion, unless I repent (D.P.).                      Daughter  in  Jesus  Christ,  please  see  whether  the  in-                disposition you plead depends on the regret that you live in                Altamura, far from the house of Trani. The air is excellent in                Altamura. You have no disease. Your physical weakness is                increased by prostration because you live in this house with                regret. It is homesickness, due too lack of submission and of                virtue. You are not making a steady","resolution to live where obedience wants you to. You are not                praying to the Lord and the most holy Virgin to help you to                live where the divine will has placed you. You are like a child                crying and seeking mom. Daughter, you must know that when                a  youth  dislikes  being  in  a  house,  she  is  affected  by                homesickness. It is a moral disease causing other diseases                apparently. It can cause even fever! When a young Religious                understands that holy obedience and the Lord's will want her                to stay in a place, she stands fast against the temptations of                the  devil  and  of nature.  She  does  not  fall  sick  but  is  full  of                peace,  strength,  and  health!  How  can  you  feel  sorry  for                yourself  because  you  dwell  in  this  house,  whose  church  is                dedicated  to  the  most  holy  Immaculate  Mary?  In  a  house                situated better than that of Trani, which is the most unhappy                among ours for its position? The walk in the beautiful gardens                refreshes the spirit. Meanwhile, I am sorry that your voluntary                prostration,  which  is  due  to  lack  of  consideration,  sets  bad                examples  to  the  community,  to  the  probationers  and  to  the                children.  Blessed  daughter,  be  calm,  take  courage,  be  in  a                happy mood, do not behave like a child. As a Religious, show                faithfulness to your celestial spouse. Resume your work little   558                by  little,  and  be,  perfectly  obedient  to  your  good  mother                superior.  God  helps  all  the  obedient  souls  (Letter,  May  12,                1923).                      I regret to inform you that some persons of the religious                community  have  been  sorry  and  reluctant  at  the  order  of                transfer  from  a  house  to  another.  For  that  reason  we  have                thought  of  mailing  a  specific  formula  of  obedience  to  the                houses so that the persons who take the habit or the vows,                recite it with all their heart at the foot of the great Mother of                God.  First,  they  will  recite  it  to  ask  the  Divine  Superior  for                admittance;  second,  they  will  recite  it  during  the  religious                service in the church, at the foot","of the Holy Sacrament, before the taking of the habit or the                vows; third, they will sign it. (1) The copies will be preserved                in the archives along with the documents. Everyone must be                convinced that this chief point, whose violation may become a                serious  fault  through  the  only  internal  approbation,  may                prevent  the  culprit  from  receiving  Holy  Communion.  Please                note, however, that we are not talking about a fleeing thought                that  crosses  the  mind  without  consideration  (2)  (Circular,                March 10, 1926).

Should I do it after consideration, I would be at serious fault with                this declaration, and I would give bad example.»                    (2)   Our  padre  calls to  mind  what  has  been  said   in  the  foot-                note  to   the  article   13  of   Declarations   and   Promises:   «Everytime                the   reading   in   common   of   the   19  declaration   reaches   this                point,  all  the  people  will  stand  to  read  it  together.»  Then,  he  adds:                «While reading   this   article,   they   will   exactly   observe   what   has                been prescribed in  the foot-note.»  It is obvious that such  an order was                of great importance for our padre.","560","CHAPTER XXXVI                                       FALLING SICK                     If  I  do  not  feel  well  or  I  need  medical  care,  I  will                beware of failing because of sickness. I will rely patiently                on  the  superiors  and on  the  brethren's  charity,  holding                that  even  a  sick  Religious  has  to  observe  holy  poverty                and to suffer  some want  or negligence  as  permitted  by                God in order to set better examples. As a matter of fact,                the good soldier is tested in the battle.                       1. DO NOT BECOME LUKEWARM IN SICKNESS                      While entering this institute, I promise once and for ever                to hand over to the mother superior everything I have without                keeping  anything  secretly,  not  even  the  medals  or  the                scapulars,  still  less  ear-rings,  jewels,  money,  souvenir  of                friends  or  of  relatives,  photos,  letters,  and  the  like.  By  so   561                doing  I  mean  to  embrace  holy  poverty;  hence,  I  will  not                complain of eventual want, not even when I am sick, but I will                be satisfied with the mother superiors' charity.

Both  nurse  and  assistant  will  observe  the  community's                devotion, recollection, and piety in the infirmary, even when                there  is  only  one  patient;  they  will  foster  good  feelings,  will                schedule  the  morning,  noon,  and  evening  prayers  together                with the mother superior, and will read the meditation on the                intimate  sorrows  of  Jesus  in  the  morning  and  the  evening;                likewise they will help the sick say the prayer before and after                the meal. An hour of silence must be established during the                day, but everything must be done in order to meet the needs                of the sick. In case of epidemic, the utmost must be done with                the Lord's help (S.D.D.Z.).                      When the sisters fall sick, they should not fail in the spirit                of poverty; on the contrary, they will seize that opportunity to                practice  poverty  by  practicing  patience.  They  may  humbly                submit  their  needs  to  the  mother  superior,  relying  on  her                generosity, without claiming the treatment which is due to the   562                rich (C.D.D.Z.).                               2. TAKING CARE OF THE SICK                      Nurse. A patient and charitable Religious, expert in how                to take care of the sick and how to receive, keep, and treat                them through hygiene and medicine will be the male nurse.                He will perceive the people who do not feel well, even when                they conceal it, and in agreement with the superiors he will                take  care  of  them  in  the  infirmary.  Attending  to  the  sick                means  care  of  the  bed,  of  the  room,  of  hygiene  and  of                cleanness.  Treating  the  sick  requires  that  he  send  for  the                doctor, carry out the prescriptions, and be responsible during                the  course  of  their  illness,  for  the  food,  and  for  everything                required.","The  male  nurse  will  also  see  to  it  that  devotion  and                piety  be  observed  in  the  infirmary.  Paying  careful  attention                that the Holy Communion be available to the sick every day,                he  will  read  spiritual  passages  for  those  who  are  able  to                listen, will exhort the sick to cheerfulness and patience, will                prevent defects and idle talk, making them bear in mind that                the  devil  makes  the  sick  relax  when  bodily  health  only  is                cared for.                      Since the male nurse must take care of the sick by day                and by night, he will the given some helpers. He will set apart                the contagious sick with due precaution, and will take care of                all the patients during their convalescence until they recover.                      If  a  sick  grow  worse,  the  male  nurse  is  obliged  under                strict  obligation of  conscience  to  inform  the superiors about                the  administration  of  the  holy  sacraments  and  about  the                appropriate assistance. He will see that the place for the most                holy  Viaticum  be  prepared  with  the  greatest  decorum,  that                holy confession, extreme unction, and the most holy Viaticum   563                be available in time so that the sick person may be spiritually                prepared and may also heal naturally (C.R.).                      The  nurse  will  be  a  charitable  sister  who  is  compas-                sionate,  loving,  sympathetic,  and  who  sees  Jesus  Christ                suffering  in  the  sick  persons.  Fully  aware  of  her  delicate                office, which deserves a great reward, she will cope with the                sick  as  she  herself  would  like  to  be  treated.  The  nurse                helpers  will  do  the  same.  The  nurse  will  often  inform  the                mother superior about the sick, especially the serious ones,                and  will  be  most  vigilant  that  the  holy  sacraments  of  the                confession,  Viaticum,  and  extreme  unction  be  available  to                them, according to the Church's teaching. Besides forgiving                sins  and  their  vestiges,  extreme  unction  heals  the  body                without fail at these two conditions:","1.  That  the  sick  receive  the  extreme  unction  when  a                decisive change may occur in the course of disease without a                miracle; if the sacrament is given when such a change cannot                occur without a miracle, the extreme unction has no effect on                the body, because it does not work through miracles.                      2. That the sick improve in spiritual life after recovering;                in  fact,  if  recovery  were  to  the  prejudice  of  the  soul,  God                would  deprive  the  extreme  unction  of  its  healing  power.                Therefore, so that the extreme unction may heal the sick, it                must  be  received  in  time,  when  the  disease  is  serious,  but                death is not unavoidable; and the sick must make resolves of                behaving  in  a  new,  perfect,  holy  manner  through  the                amending of defects and bad inclinations as well as through                the  practice  of  holy  virtues  and  the  perfect  observance  of                divine law.                      If extreme unction is given in time and the sick will keep                his resolves, the sacrament will heal without fail.                      The  mother  superior  and  the nurse  are  warmly  recom-  564                mended  to  prepare  the  sick  for  extreme unction  in  time;  on                the other hand, each sister must be mindful of asking for this                sacrament when she is struck by serious disease. Because                extreme unction has frequently healed when it was received                in time, the sacrament has been called Anointing of the Sick;                also the prayers of this sacrament implore the healing of the                sick who are receiving it. (S.D.D.Z.).                                    3. SPIRITUAL MEANS                      The chief spiritual means to recover from sickness is the                use  of  Holy  Oil.  Additional  means  are  the  community's                prayers, novenas or triduos, especially when the sick suffers                a great deal.","Another  spiritual  means  is  the  invocation  of  the  most                holy name of Jesus by saying one Our Father, Hail Mary, and                Glory  before  and  after  the  sick  swallow  a  slip  of  paper  on                which  the  name  of  Jesus  is  written.  When  this  most  holy,                powerful  name  was  given  and  was  received  with  faith,  it                healed many times.                      Oil  from  the  tabernacle's  lamp  may  be  used  together                with the prayers from the Riva Filotea, or with other prayers                and  pious  practices;  but  the  community  and  the  sick  will                perform everything, conforming perfectly to the divine will.                      These  means  must  be  used  for  the  sick  in  the  same                way,  without  preference;  by  so  doing,  we  please  our  Lord,                who  will  heal  the  persons,  especially  those  who  are  more                concerned with the community's interests. While using these                means,  the  sick  are  also  prepared  to  trust  in  the  divine  will                and to conform to it.                      When  even  the  least  among  the  Religious  is  seriously                sick, all earthly and celestial means will be used to make her   565                recover (S.D.D.Z.).","566","CHAPTER XXXVII                               ACCEPTING THE CHANGES                                IN THE DECLARATIONS                     I am signing these declarations and promises with a                free will after examining and considering them carefully. I                acknowledge that the spirit of the institute, of the rules,                and of the constitutions Is contained in them.                     From now on I accept any addition or change that the                legitimate authority will consider just to ameliorate them,                or to make them more fitting to the observance, or more                effective for the Institute and the congregants. In view of                what may arise in the future, I will follow the superiors'                advice and directives as well as the usages and customs                of the institute.                     I  also  declare  to  accept  the  rules  and  the                constitutions  that  the  legitimate  authority  will  make  for                the     congregants     of    this   pious     Institute.  567","568","CHAPTER XXXVIII                            READING THESE DECLARATIONS                     I will take care to read daily, with full attention from                the book of declarations and promises that the superiors                will give me, at least one article a day and try to conform                my behavior to it. I will also pay careful attention to the                reading of the declarations in the community in order to                profit by them.                     I promise to be attentive to the reading of these protests,                promises, and declarations in order to keep them in my mind,                and to avoid any excuse when my behavior does not conform                to them. Furthermore, I consent and accept that the mother                superior  admonish  me  on  the  ground  of  these  promises,                especially if I am so negligent as to be at fault with same of                the  protests  and  declarations  that  I  have  made  and  signed                (D.P.).                                                                           569","570","CHAPTER XXXIX                         DUTY TO OBSERVE THE DECLARATIONS                     As to the duty to observe the declarations, I conform                to  the  religious  orders'  constitutions  written  by  saints:                they declare that the rules themselves do not oblige the                congregants  to  the  observance  under  pain  of  sin.  For                instance:  the  rules  command  to  keep  silence  during                certain  hours;  It  is  understood  that  the  command  does                not oblige under pain of sin; likewise, mortifications, life                in common, and so on, are commanded without pain of                sin.                     However,  I  know  that the holy  writers,  among  them                St.  Francis  of  Sales  and  St.  Alphonsus  de'  Liguori,                doctors of the holy Church and founders of orders, teach                that  the  congregants  may  sin  even  gravely  against  the                rules in the following cases:                     1.  When  they  transgress  the  rules  which  coincide   571                with divine or natural or ecclesiastical law, such as: the                duty to set good example, the devout celebration of the                mysteries, and the fasting commanded by the Church.                     2. When they transgress the rules by contempt.                     3.  When  the  repeated  transgression  of  the  rules                scandalizes or upsets the community.                     4. When the transgressor runs the risk of losing his                vocation  or  of  relaxing  to  such  a  degree  as  to  fall  into                serious  faults,  because  of  his  repeated  transgressions                against the rules.                      Given  all  this,  since  now  I  entreat  my  superiors  to                warn,  to  admonish,  or  to  reproach  me  with  these                promises and declarations that I sign, when I am at fault                with  some  of  them  either  for  human  frailty  or  for  the                hellish enemy's suggestion; I deposit them in their hands                as in the adorable Lord Jesus","Christ's  hands,  to  be  in  their  power.  Furthermore,  If  I                happen  to  contradict  the  superiors'  warnings,  or                admonitions,  or  reproofs,  or  if  I  happen  to  excuse                myself, or to break these sacred pacts, I declare that all                this  may  only  happen  because  of  my  fault,  by  mind's                blindness,  the  hellish  suggestion,  and  my  own  pride,                despite  the  false  reasons,  or  the  sophisms,  or  the                expedients that I may use to justify myself.                     I repeat what I have said in passing at the article 28:                If  I  happen  to  be  at  fault  with  these  declarations  and                promises, I will go to confess my fault in the sacrament                of reconciliation.                                                                                  572","CHAPTER XL                               PRAYER FOR PERSEVERANCE                      Because I feel myself too needy of the divine help I                order  to  observe  these  holy  promises  and  to  faithfully                persevere  until  my  last  breath,  I  humbly  entreat  my                superior and brethren to implore divine help for me from                the Lon Jesus and from the most holy Virgin, as I myself                promise  to  do.  Since  now,  I  put  this  Intention  in  the                prayer  of  the  divine  office,  in  the  holy  mass,  in  the                rosary, as well as in any work of charity and religion that                I will perform with the divine help, and in any sorrow that                the Lord will let me suffer. (1)                      I acknowledge that this divine help will never fail as                Iong as I keep these intentions and persevere in my good                will; but,  If  my  will  fails, everything  will  fail  for  my  own                fault.

At  last,  to  observe  these  promises,  protests,  any                declarations,  from  now  on  I  will  implore  humbly  and                perseveringly the most holy Heart of Jesus, the immaculate                Heart of Mary, the great Patriarch St. Joseph, St. Michael the                archangel,  the  angels,  the  holy  apostles,  and  my  patron                saints, especially St. Anthony of Padua. I am convinced that                as long as I have good will, the divine help will not fail; but, if I                break  these  promises,  protests,  and  declarations  in  such  a                way  as  to  lose  perseverance  or  to  compel  the  superiors  to                expel me from the institute (God","forbid it), since now I acknowledge that this ruin will happen                for my own bad will.

(2)                      Messina,  Sept.  25  (Sunday,  feast  of  Our  Lady  of                Lourdes), 1898.                      Owing  to  the  moral  and  to  the  material  circumstances                which threaten the institute with death, the ruling staff of the                institute along with the elders and the more faithful members                have made the following resolutions in the name of Jesus and                Immaculate Mary.                      I.  -  By  the  Lord’s  help,  the  individuals  of  this  spiritual                union  promise  to  redouble  their  trust  in  God's  infinite                goodness, in the most holy Heart of Jesus' infinite mercy, and                in  the  most  holy  Mary's,  in  the  angels',  and  in  the  patron   574                saints'  powerful  intercession.  The  greater  the  growth  of                tribulations,  the  want,  the  human  suspicions,  the  perils  of                dissolution  of  this  Institute,  the  more  the  members  of  this                spiritual union will trust in God. They choose as their motto                the Apostle Paul's saying: «We hope against hope. »                      Il.  -  So  that  their  hope  and  trust  be  truly  Christian,  the                members of the spiritual union decide:                      1. To receive everything from God. They will consider all                happenings,  as  coming  from  him  through  his  reigning  or                permitting will, not from human beings or by chance; they will                find a reason, therefore, to humble themselves, to praise, and                to bless the divine will in any event.                      2. They will rectify their intention in order to seek in this                institute the glory of God, the sanctification, and","the salvation of souls, for the greater consolation of Jesus'                Heart.                      3.  They  will  give  all  their  cooperation  through  prayer,                work, and sacrifice for the salvation of the institute.                      4.  They  first  will  suffer  with  holy  conformity  the  penury                permitted by God; will embrace the community's most difficult                work,  and  will  sacrifice  themselves  as  victims  of  charity  for                God's glory and for the souls' good.                      5. They will pray in private and in common every day for                the institute; if the circumstances allow it, they will also pray in                the  night.  Their  prayer  and  work  will  be  combined  with                mortification and fasting;                      6.  They  will  redouble  their  attention  to  the  practice  of                holy  virtues,  setting  good  example  with  the  Lord's  help  in                order to avoid sin. Avoidance of sin will appease God, who                will be merciful to us.                                   575                      7. They will receive Holy Communion every day with the                Lord's help, if it is possible. (3)                      8.  The  members  of  the  spiritual  union  renew  explicitly                their  resolution  to  persevere  in  the  service  to  God  in  this                institute  in  spite  of  persecutions,  failure,  discouragement,                tribulations,  want,  and  oppositions,  unless  the  Lord  shows                manifestly  through  the  ecclesiastical  authority  that  he  does                not want this institute any longer.                                            NOTES                     (1) Our padre wrote this prayer:                    «O  Mother of the  holy perseverance,  we  appeal  to your motherly                love. Please grant us this great grace that crowns the others: help us to                persevere,  to  grow  in  religious  virtues,  and  to  die  a  good  death  for                eternal salvation.                    O glorious St. Joseph, we also put our perseverance in your hands;                pray for us. Amen.","Ejaculatory prayer: Lord Jesus,  save us from mortal and venial sin,                giving  us  holy perseverance. Amen.»                    (2)  Our padre gave this, title. Keep in  mind  the date  Sept. 25,                1898: the institute was surviving  the painful trial that threatened  it with                death.  Melania  was  going  to  leave  Messina  and  our  padre  was                compelled  to  resort  to  the  older  persons'  generosity,  who  were  more                faithful  and  affectionate  to  the  institute:  to  guarantee  the  institute's                future, he excited their zeal for their sanctification. In that time, the feast                of Our Lady of Lourdes was not universal and  was  perhaps celebrated                on that day in Messina,                    (3)  Be not amazed at this article. In those times, the decrees by St.                Pious  X  on  the  daily  communion  had  not  come  out  yet;  our  padre,                however, was a forerunner.                                                                                   576","APPENDIX                                                                                577","578","1. THREE VOWS OF TRUST                   A) About forgiveness of sins                      My Lord Jesus Christ, kneeling in your divine presence                like the prodigal son at the foot of his father and helped by                your divine grace, I protest through my vows to never distrust                your  infinite  goodness,  clemency, and  mercy  in  spite  of  my                past,  present,  and  future  iniquities,  either  grave  or  light,  in                which I might fall. As for my past sins, I protest through my                vows  that  I  will  be  always  confident  that  you  have  forgiven                them, even though I do not give up the holy fear and the sad                remembrance of them. As for the future faults in which I may                fall, I protest through my vows that I will never distrust your                mercy, even though I might fall in the most serious iniquities                of the world; I will always trust to be forgiven in full by falling                down  at  your  feet  and  by  asking  pardon  for  your  sweetest   579                Heart's sake.                      Were  I  to  fall  seventy  seven  times  seven  in  the  same                iniquities  which  I  committed  in  the  past  or  in  worse  ones,  I                protest through my vows that I will always trust in your infinite                goodness, imploring your pardon in the same way, sure that                your sweetest Heart's superabundant piety shall forgive me in                full as though I had never offended you before. Therefore, I                take my vows that in any case, and in any relapse, I will come                to you as though that fault were the first one, sure that you                will  receive  me  with  open  arms,  on  condition  that  my                repentance be true, sincere, and loving.","B) As to the prayer's efficacy                      San  Pier  Niceto,  May  5,  1905  (Ascension  of  our  Lord                Jesus Christ)                     My  beloved  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  kneeling  in  your  divine                presence,  in  the  abyss  of my  nothingness  I  protest  through                my vows that I always want to trust in your infinite goodness                as well as in your divine promises that you hear our prayers.                You said: «The Father will give you whatever you ask of him                in my name » (Jn. 15, 16); «Ask, and you will receive; seek,                and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you»                (Mt. 7, 7); « Until now you have not asked for anything in my                name; ask and you will receive, so that your happiness may                be complete» (Jn. 16, 24). Likewise, I intend to confide in the                expressive parable of the friend knocking at another friend's                door in the night and asking for three loaves to welcome other                persons  -  the  friend  is  you,  my  supreme  goodness.  -Even                though the friend was unwilling to get up to give the loaves,                still  he  surrendered  because  of  the  importunity  of  the                situation,  and gave  the  three  loaves.  Also  in  the  parable  of                the woman seeking justice from an unjust judge  -not from a   580                judge friend, what a wonder! - and the unjust judge - you are                not, my supreme goodness - satisfied that woman because of                her importunity!                      In  the  presence  of  these  ineffable  and  surprising                promises,  I  take  my  vow  to  always  trust  in  you,  in  your                adorable  Heart,  in  your  infinite  goodness  and  liberality,  as                well as in your most holy mother, in your angels and saints,                whom  I  implore  in  your  name.  I  trust  that  you  will  infallibly                grant me the graces I have asked, the ones I am used to ask,                and will ask for your glory, for the salvation of the souls, for                me  the  miserable  and  for  my  relatives,  as  well  as  for  the                Rogation's  and  for  Divine  Zeal's  institutes  along  with  their                charitable and religious works.","If  I  ask  you  or  your  most  holy  mother  or  the  angels  or  the                saints  for  these  graces,  mercies,  and  celestial  favors  with                pure  intention,  humility,  holy  fervor,  pious  insistence,  and                perseverance,  conforming  to  your  adorable  merciful  will,  I                trust that you will hear me.                      My  beloved  love,  if  after  praying  with  all  the  good                disposition and with the greatest trust I do not receive these                graces and mercies, or I think of not receiving them, all this                notwithstanding  I  take  vows  to  always  believe  your  true,                infallible,  divine  promises,  imputing  to  my  unworthiness  and                ill-dispositions the cause for not obtaining these graces and                the mercies that I ask for myself and for others. Therefore, I                will  humble  myself,  will  hope  and  strive  to  become  worthy,                making my petitions through your merits, through the merits                of your most holy mother, the angels, and the saints, as well                as  through  the  merits  of  the  just  and  innocent  souls.  I  will                always  firmly  believe  that  you,  most  liberal  Lord,  can  and                want and will grant the graces, the mercies, and the celestial                favors that I have asked, I am asking, and will ask.      581                      Sweet Heart of my Jesus, even though you or your most                holy mother or the angels or the saints do not hear, or repel                my prayers seventy seven times seven, and quite the reverse                of my petitions happens to me, I take my vow that my trust                will  not  fail  with  your help.  I  will  hope  against  hope,  always                asking  and  waiting  for  the  divine  mercies;  to  do  homage  to                your  infallible  promises,  I  trust  and  will  trust  that  you  will                always grant me more abundant graces than the ones I wish,                hope, and ask.                      I  base  this  unlimited  vow  of  trust  in  your  infinite                goodness  upon  your  divine  merits,  on  your  most  holy                mother's, on the angels', and on the saints' merits as well as                upon  the  just  and  innocent  souls.  My  Jesus,  please  accept                this vow and lock it in your sweetest, most merciful","Heart as well as in the most Ioving, pure Heart of your most                holy mother. Look at this vow benignly and mercifully every                time I ask, wish, long for, and cry, but do not obtain or do not                seem to obtain the graces I am asking. Look at this vow every                time  your  most  just  and  holy  motives  prevent  you  from                granting what I am asking, or you do otherwise, or I do not                understand that you are granting the favors.                      O most loving sweet Heart of Jesus, 0 most immaculate                Heart of Mary, be merciful to me and to the persons for whom                I wail, sigh, and pray! Have mercy! I am a poor man in need,                and my years fail in lamentations, etc.                      Angels and saints, please have mercy on me and on my                petitions!... Celestial friends... Souls of the just on earth, may                your prayers help me. Amen.                 C) In the Institute's distress                      My  sweetest  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  in  the  sorrows  and   582                tribulations, in the doubts and want surrounding me, I come at                your feet, expecting your help and the appropriate providence                with humble, loving confidence. So that my confidence may                never  fail,  because  of  my  frail  nature,  at  your  feet  I  take                explicit vow of never distrusting, nor yielding to diffidence in                the midst of want, disappointments, failure, and persecutions,                On  the  contrary,  I  bind  myself  through  vow to  redouble  my                humble,  loving  trust  in  the  sweetest,  superabundant,  divine                piety  of  your  most  benign  Heart,  as  well  as  in  the  gentlest                motherly  charity  and  in  the  compassion  of  the  immaculate                Heart of Mary, who is your mother and ours.                      Helped by your grace and by my own good will, I bind                myself by vow to have a steady faith and hope that you and                your most holy mother can and want to free us","from any situation and risk of dispersion; that you and your                most  holy  mother  can  and  want  to  maintain,  help,  provide,                shelter;  want  to  assist,  protect,  free,  and  save  so  many                orphans, priests,  virgins,  and  poor  that  you have  supported                by  mercy,  as  well  as  these  nascent  institutes  that  are                decorated  with  your  divine  word:  «  Pray,  therefore,  to  the                owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in                his  harvest»  and  are  committed  to  spread  this  word;  these                institutes that you have guided and protected until now with                many wonders of your power and mercy.                      Meanwhile,  my  Lord,  I  bind  myself  to  never  be  dis-                heartened  in  the  fulfillment of  this  vow,  because  of  my  sins                and  of  this  institute's.  On  the  contrary,  I  will  trust  in  your                infinite  clemency  that  you  will  pass  over  our  indignity  by                covering it with your divine merits and by atoning it with your                Most Precious Blood.                      My beloved Lord, please accept this vow and lock it in                your most loving Heart and in the immaculate Heart of Mary;   583                please help me observe it exactly in the most embarrassing                situations, even when you have brought us to the hell's doors                and  almost  to  nothing;  then,  please  see  to  it  that  full  of                humble trust, hope, and confidence I may have the living faith                that  you  can,  want  and  will  save  us  unexpectedly  even  by                working miracles of omnipotence and mercy! Amen!                      I say one Hail Mary to the most holy Virgin, asking her to                bless this vow, to help me fulfill it faithfully, to hope against                hope,  and  to  present  it  to  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus.                Amen.                      Messina, July 5, 1905","2.

By  doing  your  most  holy                mother's will in everything, and by living under her obedience,                we will perform everything according to your most holy will, O                Eucharistic Heart of Jesus.

As humble congregants  of the                least order of the Evangelical Rogation by the Heart of Jesus,                we kneel at your motherly feet and entreat you to present our                petition  to  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus  so  that  he  may                constitute  himself  as  our  immediate, absolute,  and  effective                superior,  as  well  as  our  guide  and  teacher.

We  entreat  you,  O  immaculate  mother,  to  crown  this                ineffable grace by obtaining from your adorable son that you                too  may  constitute  yourself  as  our  immediate,  effective                mother superior, as well as our guide and teacher.

We know that 9 years ago, on Dec.                8, fifty years after your Immaculate Conception's dogma, the                houses  of  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  by  the  interests  of                Jesus'  Heart  proclaimed  you,  O  Immaculate  Mother,                absolute,  effective,  and  immediate  owner,  superior,  and                teacher,  but  always  mother.  Since  then,  you  have  shown                through  several  signs  that  you  have  accepted  that   588                proclamation  by  constituting  yourself  owner,  teacher,  and                superior general and particular of that community and of the                future ones. What about the miracle you worked in the house                of  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  in  Trani,  (2)  through  this                sacred statue Then, you showers yourself to be really mother,                teacher,  and  immediate  superior:  mother,  because  you                rushed  to  help  a  wailing  creature  struck  by  an  incurable                disease. You said: « Daughter, get up; I have healed you. »                Then,  you  signed  her  with  the  cross,  adding:  «  I  bless  and                restore you to health. » In a moment, the sick daughter was                free from disease. Teacher, because you brought everything                to  a  successful  conclusion  through  holy  teachings  of  pru-                dence and discipline. Effective and immediate superior,","because you called one sister by name at midnight, telling her                to wake up in order to inform the sisters about the wonder,                and  to  praise  the  Lord  all  night  long  before  the  Holy                Sacrament, which they did.                       O  sweetest,  loving  Immaculate  Mother,  not once  but  a                thousand  times  we  proclaim  you  absolute,  immediate,  and                effective mother, owner, teacher, and superior together with                the  most  holy  Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus.  We  firmly  trust  in                your  motherly  sweetest  charity,  being  sure  that  you  will  not                repel this humblest petition on this day, which is three times                most  solemn  for  us.  On  the  contrary,  we  trust  that  you  will                accept  it,  as  you  accepted  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal's                proclamation  some  years  ago.  To  tell  the  truth,  we  do  not                deserve  such  an  ineffable  grace,  but  we  exhibit  the  divine                word which came from the divine zeal of Jesus' Heart: « Pray,                therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that he  will  send  out                workers to  gather  in his  harvest,  »  which  is  flashing  on our                chest.

We are a little seed springing up right now from                the  soil.  Please  make  us  grow  in  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of                Jesus and in your Immaculate Heart.                      To be sure that the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus along with                you  has  accepted  and  granted  our  petition  through  your                powerful intercession, we ask no supernatural signs like the                miracle you worked in Trani. We ask you instead to heal our                souls  from  the  bad  inclinations,  to  purify  us  from  sins,  to                enlighten our intellect with the light of divine","wisdom, to kindle our heart with the flames of divine love, to                strengthen  our  will,  and  to  increase  our  religious  affection                toward the institute. O mother, we beseech you to work the                wonders  of  grace  in  us,  such  as:  conversion  to  Jesus,  our                supreme good, acquisition of the virtues, especially humility,                holy  meekness,  detachment,  perfect  obedience,  and  pure                zeal  for  the  interests  of  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus.  O                beautiful Immaculate Lady, please see to it that we become                always more fond of Jesus in the Holy Sacrament and that he                may  be  our  love  and  our  goal  for  ever.  Immaculate  Lady,                owner,  mother,  and  teacher,  give  us  holy  perseverance  in                good, and eternal life at the end.

C)  LITTLE  RULE  in  compliance  with  the  proclamations                on July 1 and 2, 1913.                      1. The present and the future Rogationists will have the                Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus  and  Immaculate  Mary  as                immediate,  absolute,  effective  superiors,  who  are  always                present in the midst of them, although invisible, according to                the proclamations;                      2. The Rogationists will see the divine superiors in any                order, command, and direction given by those having power                on them;                      3. While reading the rules and the constitutions, they will                learn  each  article  as  if  Immaculate  Mary  were  reading  on                behalf of the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus;","4.  They  will  say  the  brief  Latin  prayer  Sacratissimum                Cor... (most sacred Heart), before any action in common;                      5.  They  will  hold  as  a  holy  secret  of  the  institute  the                ineffable  grace  of  the  double,  divine,  celestial,  absolute,                effective, and immediate superiority, which is invisible to the                senses but visible in the legitimate external relations; they will                say  secretly  in  their  heart:  it  is  a  secret  of  mine.  Calling  to                mind the words of Raphael the archangel, they will say: «It is                good concealing the king's secret»;                      6. Before making an important decision, the rectors will                appeal  to  the  divine  superiors,  submitting  the  case  to  them                and  imploring  enlightenment  and  direction  in  order  to  work                out the divine will in everything;                      7. In minor cases, before making a decision, the rectors                or  overseers  will  appeal  privately  by  internal  prayer  to  the                divine superiors;                      8.

When each Rogationist receives Holy Communion, he                will  receive  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus  as  the  celestial,                divine  superior  with  intimate,  proper,  and  due  love.  He  will                offer himself as a son, subject, slave out of love, and disciple,                promising  perfect  obedience  to  his  most  holy  will  in                everything;  he  will  honor  and  obey  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of                Jesus with faith and, love through his representatives;                      10.Beginning  with  the  happy  double  proclamation,  the                Rogationist by the Heart of Jesus will have a special affection                and  respect  toward  his  institute's  holy  emblem:  «  Pray,                therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that he  will  send  out                workers to gather in his harvest. » He will see","in the holy tabernacles the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, who is                afflicted for lack of clergy, as pointing to St. Luke's (10, 2) and                to  St.  Matthew's  (9,  37)  verses,  showing  the  people                abandoned  like  sheep  without  a  shepherd,  and  inviting  to                watch  the  ample  harvest  in  ruin  for  lack  of  workers.  He  is                saying:  «  As  sweet,  benign,  and  loving  superiors,  I  and  my                most  holy  mother  give  you  a  rule.  Pray  continuously  in  my                name to the owner of the harvest (me and my father) as well                as  to  my  most  holy  mother  that  we  hasten  to  send  out                copious  and  holy  workers  to  the  mystical  harvest.

We deem to publish the two                formulas,  where  the  padre states  his  thought  and teaches  how  to  live                under  the  spirit  of  subjection  to  the  Divine  Superiors.
