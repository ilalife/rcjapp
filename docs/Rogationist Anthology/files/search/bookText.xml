                    The  unforgettable  Fr.  Vitale  wrote  the  precious
               biography  of  our  padre,  the  main  source  for  those  future
               authors who will write his story. However, this biography does
               not contain the whole padre. As Fr. Vitale has pointed out, we
               perceive  the  spirit  of  our  padre  equally  and  perhaps
               prevalently  in  his  own  writings.  Because  his  writings  are  a
               precious  guide  to  the,  Rogationists  and  the  Daughters  of
               Divine Zeal's spiritual life, as well as to their government and
               to the efficient development of the Rogationist apostolate, Fr.
               Vitae hoped that they would be published.
                    Our communities feel the need of reading and meditating
               on our padre's writings; but the superior general, even more
               so, feels such a need; and urges that they be published since
               he  has  the  responsibility  of  keeping  the  spirit  of  our  padre
               alive in the institutions. To meet his urgent solicitude we have
               made this Anthology - a collection of flowers - flowers plucked
               from the garden of our padre's writings.                  5
                    It is well known that our padre was a prolific writer, but
               due to lack of time he did not finish any work. Not even the
               dossier    «  Spirit  of  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  »  (*)  is
               complete; in fact, the treatise about the





                   (*)  Our  padre  addressed  the  work  to  the  Daughters  of  Divine
               Zeal  because  they  were  more  numerous  than  the  Rogationists;
               however,  our  padre  repeatedly  said  that  he  fixed  the  spirit  of  the
               whole institute in this work and that he had a mind to add what was
               peculiar to the Rogationists.]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[Rogate that he had promised does not exist! What a pity!
                    However,  we  have  voluminous  notes  of  speeches,
               circulars, confidential letters, numerous outlines of rules such
               as the rules or the plain prescriptions which he wrote for the
               use of various male and female communities; these writings
               are  not  mere  outlines,  on  the  contrary  some  paragraphs  of
               rules resemble true treatises on the spiritual life, which reflect
               the spirit and the personality of the person who is our padre.
                    Our  padre's  records  are  a  vast  treasure;  by  picking  up
               spangles, nuggets, and golden streams we can easily gather
               riches. Getting out of the metaphor we say that the wealth of
               our padre's teaching springs from his records, outlines, and
               directions;  if  we  gather  them  with  love,  follow  them  with
               wisdom,  and  are  generously  faithful  to  the  grace  of  our
               vacation, we Rogationists and Daughters of Divine Zeal will
               became children worthy of our padre.
                    As a scheme of this work we have chosen the « Forty
               Declarations and Promises » our founder wrote far the priests
               in August 1910, in St. Pier Niceto. Around that time, Fr. Vitale
               had already entered the order, while Canon Celona was also
               willing to enter. Through this work, our padre expounded the   6
               spirit  of  the  order  briefly.  The    «  Forty  Declarations  and
               Promises  »  form  the  forty  chapters  of  this  book:  each
               declaration is a somewhat broad topic, around which we have
               gathered our padre's writings we felt to be appropriate.
                    This  work  is  not  meant  to  be  a  rule  for  changing  or
               substituting  the  rules  in  force  in  the  communities;  in  these
               writings  we  find  the  whole  padre  with  his  spirit,  ideals,
               teaching, charity, and zeal along with references to usages of
               time and places sometimes superseded.]]></page><page Index="7"><![CDATA[Especially  the  repetitions  we  have  not removed  because of
               the  nature  of  the  work.  They  show  our  padre  alive  and
               working,  always  busy  to  sanctify  his  children,  as  well  as  to
               strengthen the foundation in the way of the Lord. This was his
               only  aim,  the  program  of his  life.  This must be  ours  for  the
               greatest consolation of the heart of Jesus!

                               by His Eminence Cardinal

                             ARCADIO MARIA LARRAONA

               To  the  Rogationists  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus  and  to  the
               Daughters of Divine Zeal

               My dear children of Padre Di Francia:

                    Your venerable and beloved padre could rightly tell you
               the sweet, strong words that St. Paul said to the Corinthians
               (I. Cor. 4, 15): « Even if you have ten thousand guardians in
               your life in Christ, you have only one father. For in your life in
               Christ Jesus I have become your father by bringing the Goad
               News to you.» With easy, ample, deep application your padre
               tells  you:  «  Through  the  grace  of  Gad,  source  of  any
               fatherhood, I have begotten you to the religious life, spirit, and   9
               apostolate of the Rogationists by giving you the constitutions,
               the treasure of my teaching, and fecund abundance of heroic,
               continuous,  practical  examples  as  well  as  by  immolating
               myself  for  the  foundation  of  the  order  and  for  each  one  of
               you. » This complete, generous, effective, spiritual fatherhood
               of  your  Padre  founder  continues  «  until  Christ's  nature  is
               formed in you,» until each of you reproduces Jesus in himself
               according to his vocation, following the perfect, lovable, close
               model  of  Padre  Di Francia,  who  says  to  you:  « Imitate  me,
               just as I imitate Christ» (I. Cor. 4,16; 11, 1).]]></page><page Index="10"><![CDATA[It is fortunate for the children of Padre Mary Hannibal Di
               Francia  to  have  preserved  such  a  great  treasure  of
               documents, exhortations, counsels and criteria that deal with
               so  many  standpoints  of  ascetism,  discipline,  formation,
               apostolate,  and  government  of  the  orders.  This  fatherly
               heritage could not be hidden or scattered. We heartly praise
               the superior general for having disposed with wise perception
               the  collection  and  the  arrangement  of  the  fatherly  treasure
               and for having entrusted sedulous, clever, and filial hearted
               people with this responsibility.

                    A man's honor derives from the respect he showed to his
               father (Eccl. 3, 11). Since this blessed book will be the fecund
               root which is going to infuse new blood into so many works,
               booklets, and editions of any kind, it will be the conductor of
               the  strengthening,  sweetest,  continuous  blessing  of  your
               padre; an the other hand, by explaining and applying the new
               blood they will draw from this anthology, the works will form
               the Rogationists' sound literature.

                    While presenting my warmest congratulations, I pray to   10
               obtain  elect  blessings  on  the  two  orders  and  I  encourage
               them to follow such a great, lovable father founder with the
               most generous, happy loyalty.

                        Rome, Aug. 22, 1960

                                            Sincerely yours,

                                RELIGIOUS VOCATION

                    Following  the  call  I  felt  in  my  heart  I  entered  this
               community to serve God more closely, to seek a greater
               personal sanctification, and to affect a greater good for
               souls  through  the  regular  observance,  discipline,
               practice of religious virtues, and the sacred bond of the
               religious  profession  without  any  ulterior  motive  of
               personal convenience.
                    I  intend  to  accomplish  all  this  with  God's  help  and
               my own good will.


                                 1. PURE INTENTION

                    The Little Refuge of St. Joseph novices will keep in mind
               the  holy  aim  they  had  when  they  humbly  applied  for
               admittance  in  the  Little  Refuge.  The  aim  is:  to  want  only   13
               Jesus  and  to  belong  to  him  only...  By  belonging  totally  to
               Jesus and by rejecting totally the corrupt deceiving world; by
               striving for a virtuous life, overcoming defects and bad habits;
               to achieve the happy state of divine union (R.L.P.).
                    The  Little  Poor  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  will  be
               detached  from  worldly  goods  in  order  to  find  and  possess
               Jesus only, he who is the hidden treasure of faith. Having no
               concern with worldly matters, they will seek the glory of God
               and the salvation of souls, which are the interests of the most
               holy heart of Jesus (R.L.P.).
                    They will attentively beware of the lightest voluntary]]></page><page Index="14"><![CDATA[defect, also avoiding the unintentional ones, as much as they
               can (D.S.S.).
                    The  Little  Retreat  probationers  will  have  the  pure
               intention to enter the religious status in order to belong totally
               to God, to promote the greater consolation of the most holy
               Heart  of  Jesus,  and  to devote  themselves  to  the  service  of
               the poor (R.P.).
                    I declare that I entered this institute because I felt myself
               moved  by  pure  intention  of  achieving my  own  sanctification
               and of giving up myself to God, living the religious life through
               the  perfect  observance  of  this  institute's  rules  without  any
               perspective  of  a  personal  position  or  any  ulterior  motive.
               Since I have renounced worldly matters I enter the institute as
               a new creature, keeping in my mind and heart nothing of the
               world; therefore, I will never think of it nor will I speak of my
               past  life  in  the  world  or  in  my  family  with  anyone  in  the
               institute (D.P.).
                    « The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are
               clear, your whale body will be full of light; but if your eyes are
               bad, your body will be in darkness » (Mt. 6, 22).
                    The  eyes  stand  as  a  symbol  for  pure  intention  to   14
               accomplish  everything  for  God,  for  his  glory,  and  for  the
               greater  consolation  of  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus.  Pure
               intention will make the actions of the probationer upright and
               good, while lack of pure intention will make them obscure.
                    The probationer who does not purely work for Jesus will
               never achieve the spiritual life. For him, the virtues will be like
               an  external  practice  whose  performance  will  lead  him  to  a
               spirit  of  simulation  and  hypocrisy,  which  makes  him
               undeserving to live in the house of the Lord (P.R.P.).]]></page><page Index="15"><![CDATA[2. POSTULATE

                    The  probationers  who  aim  at  entering  the  religious
               community for the greatest consolation of the Heart of Jesus,
               must form their spirit according to Christian perfection. During
               the  postulate  they  shill  aim at  destroying  the  desires  of  the
               natural self, or better yet, at putting to death their old being
               (Rom. 6, 6) in order that they may live a new life with Christ.
               They mint aim at becoming men of God, with the Lord's help
               (P.R.P.).
                    Before the taking of the garb the candidates for religious
               life  are  to  be  tested  accurately.  The  master  of  piety  and
               experience will train them in Christian perfection, teaching the
               religious  virtues  and  the  order's  rules.  If  the  candidates  for
               religious life have no, disposition to piety or recollection, but
               have  attachment  to  themselves  or  to  their  relatives  or  are
               mendacious and false or gluttonous or wrathful, they must be
               sent home, unless they amend since the beginning (C.R.).
                    (Talking  to  the  Lord):  Postulate  is  the  time  when  our
               vocation is tested in order that we may see whether we really
               want  to  answer  the  divine  cell.  Now  is  the  time  when  the   15
               strongest proofs will rigorously test our intentions in order to
               see whether they are right or wrong, sincere or false. Now is
               the time when the test is going to discard those who have no

               pure,  good  intention  so  that  we  may  accept  any  test,
               mortification,  and  contradiction,  heartily  and humbly.  Please

               goodness,  let us  grow  in  our  holy  vocation, let  us be  yours
               and persevere in your call till our last breath (From a primal
               rite and prayer far admittance to postulate)!]]></page><page Index="16"><![CDATA[Since  I  am  going  to  take  the  garb  of  the  Rogationist
               novices of the heart of Jesus:
                       1. I assert that I am unworthy of such a great grace,
               because my admittance to the novitiate is due to God and to
               my superiors' kindness;
                       2. I formally assert that the entrance into the novitiate
               along with the taking of the sacred garb is the beginning of
               the true test which will help me to develop religious virtues.
               Henceforth  I  acknowledge  that  from  now  on  I  cannot  be
               excused for my faults, which will be more serious owing to the
               religious  garb,  which  binds  me  both  to  give  good  example
               and to practice the virtues.
                    Likewise  I  acknowledge  that  the  novitiate  requires  a
               humble,  penitential  life,  which  needs  to  be  tested  by
               mortifications, humiliations, and penances that my superiors
               deem to give me; therefore I will humbly accept them without
               reply or excuse, even though I think or I am sure of not being
               at fault.
                    I  recognize  that  the  constitutions  are  the  rules  of  my
               behavior.  I  promise  to  observe  them  exactly  and  to  accept
               any penance in case of infringement.                      16
                    At last, I declare that if these promises are hard for me
               or the life of the novitiate is too severe for me, I am free to
               refuse  the  taking  of  the  garb;  but  if  I  take  it,  by  doing  so  I
               confirm the promises and declarations, putting myself in the
               hands  of  holy obedience  as  an  unworthy  slave  of  the most
               holy  Virgin,  in  order  that  I  may  uncomplainingly  accept  the
               suffering  and  the  humiliations  that  are  part  of  my  spiritual
               formation. The life that destroys my natural self to let me live
               with Jesus Christ my Lord begins with the taking of the garb
               (Promises before the taking of the habit, March 17, 1907).
                    I  solemnly  promise  that  when  God's  will  has  been
               discerned by my superiors and I am permitted to take]]></page><page Index="17"><![CDATA[the  garb  I  will  not  deceive  myself  by  thinking  that  the
               probation  time  is  over  or  that  I  may  live  as  I  like;  on  the
               contrary, I will acknowledge that the true test of religious life
               (mortification,  humility,  obedience,.  practice  of  divine  love,
               charity  toward  neighbor,  patience,  and  perfect  execution  of
               my duties) begins with the entrance in the novitiate.
                  The  duties  of  the  novitiate  are  the  following:  prayer,
               penance,  humiliation  for  Jesus,  renunciation  of  my  opinion
               and will, perfect observance of the runes, pure zeal and holy
               wishes for divine glory and salvation of souls, fervent prayer
               to  obtain  good  workers  toy  the  Church,  practice  of  holy
               poverty,  detachment,  true  service  to  our  divine  owner  and
               mother,  of  whom  I  am  a  faithful  slave  of  love,  and  the
               acquisition of interior virtues.
                  This  is  my  opinion  about  the  novitiate;  therefore,  when
               holy  obedience  calls  me,  I  will  enter  the  novitiate  with  holy
               fear in order to begin the destruction of my natural self and to
               transform myself in the crucified Jesus.
                  As  an  aspirant,  as  a  probationer,  and  above  all  as  a
               novice, with the Lord's help and my own good will I promise
               to accept any test and mortification the superiors will ask of   17
               me, knowing that without roofs of penance, mortification, and
               humiliation I wild be unable to subdue my own pride in order
               to become a perfect bride of the crucified Jesus (D.P.).


                                3. TAKING OF THE GARB

                  You  have  taken  the  garb  to  your  great  satisfaction  as  it
               usually  happens  to  those  who  take  it.  Take  care,  however:
               your  fervor  must  not be  superficial  and  fleeting,  but  serious
               and  lasting.  You  must  understand  the garb's  significance  in
               your life.
                    The meaning is: renunciation of the world. In fact, is]]></page><page Index="18"><![CDATA[there  any  likeness  between  the  worldly  habits  and  the
               religious ones? Not at all. On the contrary, they are quite the
               reverse.  The  worldly  habits  are  made  of  good  fabric,  the
               religious ones of poor material; the former are dazzling, the
               latter  dark;  the  worldly  habits  have  fringes  and  lace,  the
               religious  ones  are  simple;  the  first  are  tight  or  open,  the
               second, roomy and closed; the first appear vainglorious, the
               last modest and humble; the mundane habits are the uniform
               of  the  world,  the  religious  garbs  signify  belonging  to  Jesus
               Christ!
                    Haw very precious is the religious garb! The saints loved
               it so much that they wanted to die wearing it.
                    The religious garb is precious because it represents the
               religious  virtues,  while  impatience,  disobedience,  pride,
               immodesty are at loggerheads with it.
                    Take care: the cowl does not make the monk! How many
               laymen,  who  bear  no  religious  garb,  will  appear  better
               dressed  with  virtues  and  spirit  on  the  judgment  day!
               Therefore, follow your holy vocation faithfully, complying with
               the duties the religious garb requires of you (Speech, May 18,
               1915).                                                    18
                    To the amazement of the angels, God clothed you with
               the  precious  religious  garb,  at  whose  comparison  the  most
               costly worldly clothing are rags. Before you took the religious
               garb, it was blessed with these words: « Garb which the Saint
               Fathers considered to be a symbol of innocence and humility
               for those who renounce the world. »
                    By  celestial  enlightenment  the  holy  Fathers  felt  that
               those  who renounce  the  world  wear a  garb as  a  symbol  of
               innocence and humility; therefore, you must be innocent and
               humble:  innocent  by  keeping  yourselves  free  from  any  sin
               and by purifying yourselves of past faults,]]></page><page Index="19"><![CDATA[because by taking the sacred garb you die to the world and
               are  born  to  a  new  life.  Humble,  because  the  religious  garb
               has nothing to do with worldly pride... Your garb obliges you
               to  answer  God's  call  and  to  Lift  up  your  heart  and  soul  in
               foretaste  of  the  heavenly  happiness...  (Speech,  Aug.  24,
               1809).
                    Dearest  children,  the  Lord  called!  you  to  religious  life
               through  a  special  grace.  By  answering  the  divine  cold  you
               leave the world, where everything is risky for the soul, where
               Gad is often forgotten, and where predominate bad example,
               pernicious  sayings  and  happenings,  human  respect,
               disregard for the sacraments and for eternal salvation.
                    By entering the order you enter a haven of salvation, you
               enter the house of God.
                    In  the  religious  community  everything  leads the  soul  to
               Christian perfection, assuring eternal salvation. Religion is the
               rule of life, is continuous merit of holy obedience, worship of
               God and honor to the most holy Mary, to the angels and the
               saints. Religion demands devotion to holy prayer and spiritual
               readings,  exercises  of  virtue  and  mortification,  care  of
               preaching, good example, reception of the sacraments, and   19
               mutual  charity.  The  Religious  live  in  the  presence  of  God,
               meditate on the truths of faith, stay with Jesus in the Blessed
               Sacrament,  pray,  serve  God,  performing  good  works  and
               taking  care  of  their  own  eternal  salvation  as  well  as  that  of
               others.  They  enjoy  peace  of  conscience  and  divine
               providence, which never fails those who are at the service of
               God  living  in  his  grace.  At  last,  they  die  in  a,  holy  manner
               sharing the life of the unintelligible, eternal happiness.
                    Dearest  children,  to  achieve  these  ,goods  you  have  to
               enter  religion  with  purest  intention,  With  a  fullness  of  faith,
               and with determined will to persevere until death.]]></page><page Index="20"><![CDATA[Pure  intention  requires  of  you  to  seek  God,  his  glory,
               and  your  sanctification:  it  requires  of  you  to  enter  the
               community in order that you may belong to God totally.
                    The fullness of faith requires of you to be aware of the
               special grace God gave you as well as of the preeminence of
               religious  life  in  order that  you  may  consecrate  yourself  with
               your  whole  heart,  being  ready  for  any  sacrifice  in  order  to
               achieve the great goods of so celestial a status.
                    Determined will to persevere must be the base and the
               unshakable  foundation  of  the  holy  status  you  choose.  It  is
               better  not  to  start  than  to  go  back  after  the  start.  No  one
               compels,  you  to  take  the  sacred  garb;  however,  once  you
               take it, never will you put it off, not even at your death; it must
               go with you to the grave. You will never back temptations of
               the hellish enemy, personal passions, false suggestions and
               snares of the world which will try to lure you back. But you will
               fortify yourselves by renewing your determined resolution to
               persevere.  Arm  yourselves  with  constancy  and  courage.
               Prepare yourselves for the battle against the contrary powers,
               natural  fickleness,  and  boredom.  Be  aware  of  the  apostle's
               saying: « An athlete who runs in a race cannot win the prize   20
               unless he obeys the rules » (2 Tim. 2, 5), as well as the word
               of  Jesus  Christ:  «  Whoever  holds  out  to  the  end  will  be
               saved» (Mc. 13, 13). (From a primal rite of the taking of the
               Rogationist garb).


                            4. HAPPINESS IN THE RELIGIOUS LIFE

                    Dear youth, you have entered the house of God; please
               consider the following goads you find.
                    Peace.  What  is  it?  The  most  precious  thing  which
               includes sweetness of heart, stillness of passions, quiet]]></page><page Index="21"><![CDATA[of  the  soul  in  God.  Jesus  Christ  said:  Peace  with  you!  You
               find this peace in religious life.
                    Cheerfulness.  It  is  the  outcome  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  the
               fountain  of  holiness.  Owing  to  the  comfort  of  faith,  a  true
               Religious is always cheerful, even in the midst of opposition;
               therefore you must devote yourself to the service of God with
               cheerfulness.
                    Holiness.  If  you  follow  your  vocation,  you  will  be  holy.
               You  entered  the  religious  house,  which  is  the  fertile  field  of
               God's  grace  paying  30,  60,  100  per  cent.  In  this  place  you
               find every means for your sanctification such as prayer, the
               sacraments,  preaching,  rules,  exercise,  care.  Do  you  find
               these in the world? You know that the world is full of risks,
               sins, scandals, and that those who live in it are seldom able
               to attend to religious life!
                    Most  affectionate  parents.  Jesus  Christ  said:  «  Every
               one who has left... father or mother... will receive a hundred
               times more » (Mt. 19, 29). You find the priests, who are both
               fathers and elder brothers, the superiors, who are fathers, the
               fellows,  who  are  brothers.  Is  there  any  family  more  joyous,
               lovely,  and  dear than  the  religious  one?  Where  do  you  find   21
               more union, love, and fidelity?
                    You are also provided with the temporal goods, by divine
               providence. I assure you that 'the necessities of life will never
               fail the house of the Lord. Bread fails so many tables, never
               those  of  the  good  Religious:  the  rich  have  wanted  and
               suffered, those, however, who search for the Lord shall not
               be  deprived  of  any  good  (Ps.  33,  11).  «  We  seem  to  have
               nothing,  yet,  we  really  possess  everything»  (2  Cor.  6,  10).
               Jesus Christ said: «Be concerned above everything else with
               his, kingdom and with what he requires, and he will provide
               you  with  all  these  other  things»  (Mt.  6,  33).  The  Lord  will
               endow you with spiritual goods, also providing the temporal
               ones you]]></page><page Index="22"><![CDATA[need. O lucky youth, what else will you find in the house of
               God?  When  I  told  you  what  you  will  find,  I  began  with  the
               lesser: now I will go on to the greater.

                    You are lucky! You will find... Jesus, the bridegroom of
               loving souls!

                    He is beautiful, and no one can compete with him. He is
               rich, and we find everything in him because he has all riches
               in  his  hands.  He  is  noble  for  his  eternal  generation  and
               kingship! He is powerful, for he moves heaven and earth, and
               the  universe  obeys  him.  He  is  loyal,  and  he  never  fails,  as
               men  do.  He  is  God,  and  he  makes  a  sister  consecrated  to
               him a queen on earth and in heaven (Speech, Jan. 18, 1903).

                    Happiness springs from peace, but only Jesus gives it.
               You  find  this  peace  abundantly  in  religious  life.  Here  the
               passions  are  mortified  and  subdued  to  reason  through
               observance of rules and obedience. Here the soul lives in the
               grace  of  God,  feels  His  presence,  feels  herself  united  with
               Him, finds peace, and rests in Him.                       22

                    Christian  hope  is  a  fountain  of  great  happiness.  In  the
               world, people hope vainly, looking after phantoms, but hope
               often  comes  to  disappointment,  and  disappointment  to
               desperation. Religious life is unlike mundane life. The great
               hope of the soul consecrated to Jesus is God, who makes her
               happy, or better yet, very happy! While growing in holiness in
               religious life, the soul looks at heaven expecting to be united
               with God for ever.

                    Joy.  In  this  world,  entertainment  bores!  But  how  much
               the  consolations  given  by  Jesus  outdo  the  worldly
               amusement!  The  soul  consecrated  to  the  Lard  renounced
               earthly recreation, amusing conversations, theaters, movies,
               walks,  futilities;  she  renounced  everything  for  Jesus'  sake...
               Do you think that our Lord does not know how to recompense
               her? He does. He visits her in prayer, in]]></page><page Index="23"><![CDATA[Holy  Communion;  he  makes  her  savor  a  thousand  spiritual
               joys  such  as  the  religious  feasts,  liturgies,  devotions,
               preaching,  spiritual  readings,  elating  her  with  a  sweetest
               happiness.  She  shares  these  celestial  entertainments  with
               Jesus, Mary, and the angels as a thrilling anticipation of the
               heavenly joy (Speech, April 6, 1919).

                    I do not deny that even in the world and among married
               people there are elect souls, Who achieve eternal salvation
               with  divine  help.  But  almost  all  of  them  live  unhappily
               because  of  troubles,  responsibility,  works,  mishaps,  and  a
               thousand pains. Most of them exclaim: « Oh! If I had devoted
               myself to God in my youth! If I had foreseen what I was going
               to  suffer,  I  Would  have  decided  otherwise!  Happy  the
               Religious who live without worldly thoughts attending to their
               sanctification only! » The complaints of those who live in the
               world ' are too late!

                    Quite the opposite is the fate of a youth who answers the
               call of divine mercy, leaving the World to consecrate himself
               in a religious order. I will show you what this youth is like. He   23
               is like a small boat that the stormy waves rock in the open
               sea along with other boats, but an invisible hand draws and
               thrusts it to the harbor: the lucky boat is safe, but the others
               are still; running the risks. O lucky boat, enter the harbor. You
               are safe from the storm of the world. Now you are in peace
               (Speech, Jan. 18, 1903).


                                  5. THE NOVITIATE

                    You  are  entering  the  novitiate.  Just  as recruits  are  put
               under  military  training  to  become  experts  in  discipline  and
               strategy,  the  novices  are  trained  'in  religious  practices  to
               became  true  servants  of  Jesus  Christ.  Exercises  of  prayer
               and  of  ready,  blind,  joyous  obedience as  well  as  of  charity,
               patience, and sacrifice's will transform the]]></page><page Index="24"><![CDATA[novice into a Religious who will found himself upon humility,
               obedience,  love  of  God,  and  zeal  for  his  own  sanctification
               and salvation. This is what the novitiate is all about (Speech,
               Oct. 20, 1909).

                    The novices will be aware of the novitiate as a time of
               preparation to become true servants of our Lord Jesus Christ,
               the king of eternal glory. Consequently, they will make use of
               the novitiate far putting their inner self to death. The novices
               entered  the  novitiate  in  order  to  die  to  their  self,  to  be
               corrected,  humiliated,  to  be  poor  and  to  be  crucified  with
               Jesus  Christ  all  their  4ife  long.  They  will  offer  themselves,
               therefore,  as  victims  of  the  divine  love  of  Jesus'  Heart
               beginning  from  their  entrance  in  the  novitiate  (Rules  for
               Novices. Oct. 4, 1909).

                    A pious priest of the Lord will be the novices' master. He
               will take care of the novices, training them in the holy virtues
               of  humility,  obedience,  and  meekness  as  well  as  in  prayer
               and  daily  meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our  Lord.  He  will   24
               accustom them to mortification, penance, and self denial and
               to grow in their love of Jesus and the most holy Virgin Mary.
               He  will  give  proper  lectures,  forming  the  novices  in  the
               specific  zeal  of  the  institute,  which  is  the  zeal  for  the  great
               command of Jesus: « Pray, therefore... » He will correct the
               novices when they fall into defects and by infusing a holy fear
               of  the  little  faults  as  a  probable  cause  of  relaxation  he  will
               prepare them for the vows (R.R.C.).

                    The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  novices  of  the  Heart  of
               Jesus  will  consider  the  novitiate  as  the  preparation  time  to
               reach a perfect union with Jesus, who is the divine groom of
               souls,  and  will  strive  to  become  perfect  brides  and  faithful
               servants  of  this  king  of  eternal  glory,  who  will  make  them
               share in his everlasting happiness in heaven. But he wants
               them to be brides of sacrifice, suffering,]]></page><page Index="25"><![CDATA[love,  and  zeal  on  earth:  the  bides  of  a  suffering,  poor,
               humiliated God, crucified and immolated for the glory of the
               Father and the salvation,, of souls.

                    To  prepare  themselves  for  the  mystical  wedding  of
               religious  profession,  the  novices  of  I  this  least  institute  will
               consider  the  novitiate  as  the  time  qualified  for  putting  their
               inner self to death. May they enter the novitiate as sentenced
               to  death,  as  guided  to  the  gallows  of  justice  Where  their
               passions  wil9  be  put  to  death  in  the  midst  of  tears,
               mortification, and suffering. For them, the most holy cross of
               their  beloved  crucified  spouse  represents  the  mystical
               gallows;  upon  this  cross  they  will  find  both  death  for  their
               inner  self  according  to  the  flesh  as  well  as  our  Lord  Jesus
               Christ, who is the resurrection and the life.

                    The new Daughters of Divine Zeal of Jesus' Heart must
               understand  that  their  religious  exercises  and  virtues  begin
               with  the  novitiate  and  must  grew  with  the  profession  till  the
               end of life, when they Will be already true copies of the divine
               groom. They will be poor, humiliated, fond of contempt, dead   25
               in  the  hands]  of  holy  obedience,  pure  in  the  melting-pot  of
               suffering  as  well  as  mortified  penitent,  detached  from
               everything end everybody, exhausted by work and sacrifice,
               lighted and blazing with the love for Jesus and his most holy
               mother, full of pure zeal for divine glory and salvation of souls
               as well as zealous for the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests.

                    For their august name of Daughters of Divine Zeal of the
               Heart of Jesus and for the sublime mission of the Evangelical
               Rogation the sisters of this least institute must be just as we
               have described above. The novices will be just as the sisters
               through  the  divine  help  which  never  fails  the  souls  of  good
               will. Jesus, the sweetest over and groom, wants them to be
               perfect.]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[To  achieve  this  goal,  the  sisters  will  be  hungry  and
               thirsty  for  suffering  with  Jesus  and  for  Jesus,  for  being
               humiliated,  mortified,  and  held  in  contempt.  They  will  do
               everything to please the divine Heart of Jesus and to destroy
               their  pride,  anger,  attachment,  spirit  of  simulation,  and
               laziness of nature as well as bad passions, the results of past

               fulfilled with divine light and wisdom (From the beginning of «
               Rules for the Novices of Oria»).


                               6. INNER DISPOSITIONS

                    « You must be perfect - just as your Father in heaven is
               perfect » (Mt. 5, 48).

                    Our  Lord  did not  say these  words  to  the  apostles  only
               nor  to  all  the  people  without  discrimination,  because  these
               words  must  agree  with  the  following  tremendous  saying:
               «Many  are  called,  but  few  chosen  »  (Mt.  20,  16).  To  the
               chosen ones he said these words: « You must be perfect... »   26
               You  that  I  choose  from  the  thousand  to  follow  me,  «  be
               perfect just as your Father is perfect ». Where it not the Son
               of  God  speaking,  these  words  would  be  absurd!  And  yet,
               Jesus spoke so to the elect, preparing the necessary grace to
               reach such a perfection (Speech, 1901).

                    Because divine mercy let me yield to the strong, gentle
               impulse  to  leave  the  world  and  enter  the  Evangelical
               Rogation's  institute  in  order  to  better  attend  to  my
               sanctification and to the salvation of souls, I want to specify
               my  resolves  as  soon  as  I enter  the  order. Since  the  call  to
               religious life is a call to sanctification, I declare that I enter this
               institute  with  a  steady  mind  of  persevering  and  sanctifying
               myself.  By  destroying  my  old  self  and  mortifying  my  bad
               habits I will live a new life with Jesus Christ.

                        Even though I am an unworthy priest, I recognize]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[that the sanctification I have to aspire is higher than the most
               pious and holy laymen's sanctification, and I have to long for
               it, making continuous effort to achieve it.

                    To reach this perfection with the Lord's help, I will train
               myself in the virtues as a true Christian, a true priest, and a
               true Religious (Declarations of 1907).

                    Besides facing troubles and torment, not answering the
               divine call faces the risk of getting lost. St. Alphonsus, who is
               a doctor of the Church, suggests that you should be cautious
               about  speaking  of  your  vocation,  even  with  your  confessor.
               Because  any  delay  may  expose  the  divine  call  to  risk,  he
               recommends  that  you  follow  it  quickly.  He  quotes  a  holy
               father's  saying:  «  To  be  quick,  instead  of  loosing  the  rope
               fastening the boat to the beach, cut it ». In other words he is
               saying: answer the call quickly, and leave the world.

                    This  is  the  duty  of  those  who  are  called.  On  the  other
               hand, the people who are responsible for receiving them have
               the right to look into the matter, to delay, etc. For that reason,   27
               before making the formal request for admittance to the order I
               strongly  suggest  you  to  make  an  inner  steady  decision  of
               embracing religious life along with its rules and sacrifices. To
               belong totally to God and to be victim of his love, you need to
               enter  religious  life  with  pure  intention  as  well  as  without
               ulterior  motives,  you  must  be  convinced  that  being  a  true
               Religious  means  dying  to  your  self  in  the  midst  of
               contradictions,  inner  and  external  mortifications,  and  self
               denial, it also means love of the cross, humiliation, and even
               being put off, neglected, and not loved.

                    Do  you  think  that  these  sacrifices  along  with  dying  to
               your self are not the beginning of a true life and happiness?
               Do you think that the Lord does not know how to recompense
               his faithful servants and brides?]]></page><page Index="28"><![CDATA[By entering the institute you have to leave off the « my
               character,  »  the  «  I  cannot  stand  injustice,  »  the  «  I  would
               break  rather  than  yielding,  »  and  the  like,  belonging  to  the
               world and to vanity.

                    If  there  is  no  sin,  you  shall  yield  to  and  through
               everyone; you shall be silent, approving of what your superior
               says, ever though you think that what he is saying is inexact;
               you must become like a humble, malleable child.

                    What a vast field you have for battling and winning with
               the  divine  help  land  your  good  will!  What  a  difference
               between these battles and the worldly battles and victories for
               which the world praise you! And yet, you perhaps feared of
               idling by entering the institute! It is written: « Better... a man
               master of himself than one who takes a city » (Prov. 16, 32).

                    In  this  great  battle  you  will  be  helped  by  exhortations,
               warnings, prayers, good examples, as well as by mortification
               and penance, tat you will receive and accept as a tender child
               does.                                                     28

                    In the presence of the new way of living, of the rules and
               of  religious  discipline,  your  miseries,  defects,  bad  habits,
               anger,  pride,  vanity,  attachment,  over-confidence,  etc.  will
               stir, rise up, driving you to distrust, to react, to condemn, and
               to turn back. Besides; something more horrible will happen:
               the  devil  will  battle  tremendously,  will  stir  your  passions,
               breaking  into  your  imagination,  bringing  sadness  and
               boredom in your innermost self, filling you up with doubts; he
               will make your life in the institute painful by exciting your pride
               and by trying to overcome you by all means! Perhaps, he will
               make use of an unobservant fellow! What will you do in such
               situations? Don't you think that this battle will be harder than
               those you would hive faced in he world?]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[I  am  foretelling  such  things  to  you  because  I  aim  at
               helping  your  good  will,  not  at  disheartening  you.  You  will
               overcome  these  tremendous  battles  by  being  completely
               prepared,  humble  of heart,  determined,,  and  fond  of  Jesus.
               Oh! how many things the love of Jesus teaches!

                    As to food and its quality, do not mind, because we take
               care of the youths' health; on the other hand, you will do your
               best  to  get  used  to  the  community  food,  and  God  will  help
               you. If special card is needed in some circumstances, it will
               be  taken  with  pleasure  and  charity,  as  we  do  for  all  the
               needy.  Besides,  you  have  to  surrender  yourself  to  divine
               Providence! Be sure that our dearest daughters do not take
               as much care of themselves as we do in order not to let them
               decay (Letter, Oct. 13, 1909)!

                    If you want to become a sister, I warn you, because I feel
               that  your  call  is  not  a  true  vocation.  Indeed,  true  vocation
               consists of being fond of humiliation, contempt, last position,
               under the rule of obedience; these things are sweet, beautiful,
               and  a  fountain  of  great  consolation  to  those  who  are  truly   29
               called; on the contrary, they are disgusting to those who have
               an imperfect vocation to religious life. If you were truly called
               to a life of self-denial, to a life of destruction of your will and
               mind, in a few words, to true religious life, you wouldn't have
               taken my words amiss, you would not get discouraged, you
               would  have  replied  in  the  affirmative  instead,  accepting  my
               words and saying that you were ready to everything, etc.

                    Blessed, dear daughter, God knows how dearly I paid for
               having  distressed  you  with  my  previous  letter,  but  your
               admittance in the religious community, without true signs of
               perfect vocation, would have hunt you and my community.

                        It may be that grace will overcome you later, and]]></page><page Index="30"><![CDATA[the Lord will strongly call you to religious life through lave for
               Jesus as a poor, humiliated, despised person, and longing to
               imitate  him.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  is  the  essence  of
               religious life (Letter, Feb. 14, 1910).


                               7. DIVINE PREDILECTION

                    The  predestination  mystery  is  the  most  inscrutable
               among  God's  mysteries.  The  human  mind  gets  lost  in
               considering  both  the  mysterious  ways  through  which  God
               leads  his  creatures  and  the  hidden  reasons  for  which  he
               raises some people from the dust, while bringing others down
               from their thrones. No created mind is able to fathom it (Par.
               XXI,  96).  St.  Augustine  said:  «  Why  me  and  not  others?  »
               Why did God single me out to be an object of his grace and
               mercy?  And  yet,  the  predestination  mystery  is  as  profound
               and inscrutable as certain. Putting aside the school questions
               whether  predestination  occurs  before  or  after  the  foreseen
               merits,  we  see  that  God  humiliates  same,  while  lifting  up
               others;  raises  same,  bringing  others  dawn;  afflicts  some,   30
               consoling others; impoverishes some, but making others rich;
               calls same to glory, singling others out from the thousand to
               destine  them  to  a  greater,  sublime  glory  without  depriving
               human will of its rights nor contravening his unfailing justice
               (Speech, April 27, 1888).

                    What  a  grace  is  religious  vocation!  It  is  a  sign  of
               predestination, which is not given to everyone! After the grace
               of baptism, the greatest grace God gives a soul in his mercy
               is the call to religious life. He could have chosen others, not
               you. How many youths in the world are better than you, but
               he did not call them! The Lord preferred you (Speech, April
               25, 1920).

                    Religious vocation is a priceless grace not only because
               it offers great benefits and goads, but also because]]></page><page Index="31"><![CDATA[it brings about a special predilection of God: it is the outcome
               of  a  particular,  immense  love  that  moves  God  toward  a
               person calling her to perfection in the religious life. When God
               calls  a  person  to  religious  life,  such  a  person  is  an  elect
               among  the  thousand  (Song  5,  10).  This  predilection  also
               includes  a  particular  predestination;  God,  invites  the  person
               as  He  did  with  the  apostles  and  disciples  when  He  said,  «
               Follow me » (Speech, April 21, 1907).

                    The holy gospel speaks of two Women (Mt. 24, 40) who
               were busy with grinding grain: one of them was taken away,
               the other was left behind. A great truth is concealed under the
               obscure words of this brief parable.

                    In  its  general  meaning  the  parable  shows  that  some
               people  are  assumed  for  eternal  salvation,  but  others  are
               abandoned  to  eternal  perdition.  The  mill  grinding  meal
               represents the ceaseless work of the people Who earn their
               living  in  order  to  meet  their  physical,  moral,  and  intellectual
               needs: it is the work which earns material and spiritual bread.
                                                                         31
                    The gospel uses the singular for the plural, the individual
               for  the  collective  in  this  parable.  Two  women,  one  is  taken
               away, the other is abandoned; they represent those who are
               saved,  and  those  who  tare  lost.  The  former  is  assumed  by
               God  in  his  happy  kingdom,  the  latter  is  abandoned  to  the
               power of Satan in the hellish abyss.

                    In the particular meaning, this parable makes reference
               to the liturgy we have just performed. Here, the two women
               represent  two  different  groups:  the  laywomen  and  the
               Religious. The woman God assumed is the youth God called
               to  religious  life;  the  one  left  behind  is  the  woman  who
               remained  in  the  world.  Gad  calls,  draws,  takes,  and  places
               the former in his peaceful, rich house severing her from the
               Babylon of the world: one is assumed.]]></page><page Index="32"><![CDATA[The latter does not enjoy this predilection. She is left behind
               in  the  world,  as  abandoned  to  the  stormy  human  fortunes:
               one is left behind.

                    My  dear,  you  see  how  lucky  you  are  for  having  been
               called  by  God  to  religious  life,  whose  sacred  garb  you  took
               today. So man youths, perhaps worthier than you, are not so
               lucky,  for  God  did not  call  them;  but  He  called  you,  a  poor
               creature, td such a singular favor... You were in the world as
               a little boat in the open sea, exposed to the worldly risks, in
               the midst of a thousand distractions, useless talks, dissipation
               of spirit, unavoidable occasions of sin and defects. You were
               working  in  the  mill,  busy  with  earning  your  material  and
               spiritual bread. As the mill goes around grinding the meal, so
               did your thoughts, because the powers of your soul had no
               point of concentration and peace.

                    Lo and behold! The merciful eyes of your Creator, who
               redeemed your, with his precious blood, perched on you... He
               who  sees,  the  humble  things  in  heaven  and  on  earth  (Ps.
               112,  6)  looked  on  you  mercifully,  even  though  you  were   32
               unworthy, of so a great honor. He made you feel the strong
               call  of  vacation  saying: «  Follow  me! My  dear,  come  in  the
               clefts of the rock, in the coverts of the cliff (Song. 2, 14), I will
               marry you on faith. »

                    Oh call, oh vocation, oh singular d4vine wedding! Let the
               luckiest woman in the world come here to see whether she

               grooms are wild, fruitless tries good for nothing but to burn to
               ashes. In the words of the prophet Jesus is the most beautiful
               among men; his beauty is unbeatable, because it is infinite;
               his  voice  is  more  melodious  than  the  angels',  and  one
               intonation,  one  of  his  word makes the  soul melt:  «  my  soul
               melted when he spoke » (Song of Solomon 5, 6). He is the
               richest, the most powerful groom because heaven and earth
               are made by his word.

                    Jesus  is  the  most  faithful  groom:  the  Lord  has  sworn,
               and he will not repent (Heb. 7, 21). When he gives himself to
               a soul, when he chooses a soul as his bride, he never leaves
               her, but he fills her to overflowing with new favors and new
               gifts,  on  condition  that  the  soul  remains  faithful.  Dearest
               daughter,  please  meditate  on  your  good  fortune,  continue
               looking at this picture. Today you got married to Jesus, who is
               the king of 'eternal glory. Here we have not the splendor, the
               riches, the superb coaches and palaces, the visits of ladies
               anti  gentlemen,  as  it  happens  when  a  noble  woman  gets

               singing the Idyll of this divine wedding and playing the golden
               harps, While the celestial Jerusalem was rejoicing. The happy
               spirits  of  the  celestial  court  kept  company  with  the  divine
               groom, who told you in the shadow of faith: come, my bride.

                              ROGATIONIST VOCATION

                   I declare that I felt a particular devotion to this pious
               institute and that I chose it not only for my own upright
               reasons  but  also  for  the  following  ones:  because  it
               commits  itself  to  the  finest  works  of  spiritual  and
               temporal  charity  such  as  the  rescue  of  abandoned
               orphans,    evangelization   and   assistance   to   the
               unprivileged  classes,  and  because  this  institute  is
               perhaps the only one in the Church which is committed
               to the sublime mission of carrying out the command of
               Jesus: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest that
               he will send out workers to gather in his harvest. »

                   Through the vow obedience to this divine command
               of the Heart of  Jesus' divine zeal, the institute commits
               itself  to  pray  in  order  to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy
               Church and to continuously spread all over the word the
               vocation prayer, which is called Evangelical Rogation of   35
               the Heart of Jesus.

                   I recognize that a great deal of good for the Church
               and for the people may come from the faithful obedience
               to this divine command and from the propagation of the
               Evangelical  Rogation.  Such  a  prayer  may,  incline  the
               merciful God to look favorably on this least institute, on
               condition  that  its  members  answer  this  particular
               vocation, with the help of grace and with good will.

                   I  also  acknowledge  and  declare  that  both  my
               vocation to this institute and the benign admittance the
               superiors have conceded to me depend on a particular,
               merciful,  undeserved  grace  of  the  Lord;  therefore  I  am
               grateful to divine goodness and to my superiors' charity.]]></page><page Index="36"><![CDATA[1. THE ROGATIONIST IDEA

                    At the beginning of his spiritual life and before knowing
               these divine words of Jesus: « Pray, therefore, to the owner
               of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in his
               harvest, » a youth was immersed in the predominant thought
               of increasing elect priests, hdlg and apostolic men according
               to the Heart of Jesus by winning them from God through an
               insistent  prayer.  He  felt  that  such  a  prayer  was  the  best
               means  to  work  a  greater  good  in  the  holy  Church,  to  save
               many souls, and to expand the kingdom of God on earth as it
               happened  in  the  times  of  St.  Dominic,  St.  Francis,  St.
               Ignatius, St. AIphonsus, etc.

                    For this youth, this idea was clear and unquestionable.

                    Later he was amazed and absorbed after reading these
               divine words in the gospel: « There is a large harvest, but few
               workers to gather it in. Pray to the owner of the harvest that
               he will send out workers to gather in his harvest » (Mt. 9, 37).   36
               When he became a priest, he deemed that the foundation of
               a male and a female order that would commit themselves by
               vow  of  obedience  to  the  command  of  Jesus:  «  Pray,
               therefore... », would please the Heart of Jesus and the most
               holy Virgin, besides being a fountain of great benefits.

                    The Orders should be committed to the following three
               concerns:

                    1. To pray every day to the adorable Heart of Jesus, the
               most holy Virgin Mary, St. Joseph, the angels, and the saints
               to  win  numerous  holy  priests  and  workers  (1)  for  the  holy
               Church, for the people and the nations of the world, and to
               win  extraordinary  holy  vocations  for  the  seminaries,  the
               religious orders, and the dioceses.]]></page><page Index="37"><![CDATA[2. To widely spread the spirit of this prayer all over the
               world in honor and in compliance with the divine command.

                    3. To be workers of the mystical harvest for the spiritual
               and  temporal  good  of  the  people  within  the  sphere  of  their
               activity.

                    Following  this  fixed  idea  the  poor  priest  examined  the
               religious communities and the religious orders existing in the
               Church,  as  well  as  those  that  were  being  formed;  he  was
               amazed that no religions order had picked up that divine word
               from the mouth of our Lord Jesus Christ; that command had
               almost passed unnoticed.

                    After  reflecting  on  the  gospel  he  seasoned  that  these
               words are words of Jesus Christ arid of supreme importance,
               and they are a command of his divine Heart's zeal and are
               proposed  as  an  infallible  remedy  for  the  salvation  of  the
               Church  and  society.  Consequently  that  priest  -  may  God
               forgive  his  daring,  -  began  forming  the  two  religious  orders
               that  are  bound  by  vow  to  carry  out  the  divine  command   37
               through the three concerns mentioned above.

                    Several  years  have  passed  since'  he  began  forming
               these orders.

                    The male order consists of a few priests, brothers, and
               young  students  who  are  candidates  for  the  priesthood  or
               religious  life.  They  are  called  Rogationists  of  the  Heart  of
               Jesus;  this  name  originates  from  the  Latin  word  Rogate,
               which means to pray.

                    The  female  order  consists  of  sisters  who  are  called
               Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus, because the
               divine  command  to  pray  for  vocations  originated  from  the
               Heart of Jesus' zeal.

                    These Religious wear a badge with a red heart printed]]></page><page Index="38"><![CDATA[on it reading, « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest
               that  he  will  send  out  workers  to  gather  in  his  harvest  »  (2)
               (Rules for founders, etc.).

                    You have picked up from the adorable mouth of Jesus
               Christ and from his divine Heart these words, which hold the
               secret of he peoples' and the nations' salvation: « Pray to the
               owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in
               his harvest. » Two Evangelists have registered these words
               in  the  gospel.  Thousand  of  religious  orders  have  devoutly
               studied  the  divine  book  singling  out  a  verse,  a  saying,  a
               command, a counsel, choosing them as the foundation stone
               of  their  rules,  but  it  seems  as  though  our  Lord  Jesus  had
               concealed that sublime word, that  command under his hand,
               and no one noticed it until our adorable Savior revealed it to
               the poorest among his creatures. He showed it, made it re-
               sound in your ears, had it printed in your heart and on your
               chest along with his wounded, blazing heart.

                    Oh!  Please  profit  by  such  a  great  and  inexpressible   38
               predilection. Make' use of it incessantly; lift up your implorant
               hands to haven and wail so that heaven unfold; pour out the
               just, end let the earth blossom the saviors. Wave this sacred
               banner;  the  more  you  raise  to  the  owner  of  the  mystical
               harvest  this  prayer  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  commanded,
               preserved for our times, and entrusted to you, the mare the
               good  evangelical  workers  will  increase  on  earth  and  the
               mystical harvest of souls will be saved.

                    Sublime, diving is the mission that the free distributor of
               his gifts entrusted to you. If you are faithful, it will draw the
               blessings  of  God  and  of  humankind  upon  you  (Speech,  St.
               Joseph, 1908).]]></page><page Index="39"><![CDATA[2. THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES

                    Living together under a rule of holy charity, in obedience,
               poverty, and chastity as our Lord Jesus Christ counseled, the
               saints practiced, and the Church ratified, is a great means of
               sanctification. This union brings many benefits: it helps us to
               carry  out  God's  aim,  to  fulfill  His  divine  will,  to  do  good  for
               ourselves and others, to be holy and to attain salvation.

                    The  world  understood  both  this  truth  and  need,  and
               invented the saying, « union is strength. » Hence societies,
               administrations, companies, and factories... developed. If the
               world forms these associations in order to attain a temporal
               goal, with greater reason those having more important goals
               are bound in duty to reach them by forming community.

                    Applying the saying, « union is strength » , we say: union
               of souls living together with religious vows and mutual love in
               the  service  of  God  is  a  great,  powerful,  spiritual,  invincible
               strength.  A  community  of  faithful  followers  of  the  rule  is  a
               strength,  a  bastion,  a  company  which  battles  with  spiritual   39
               weapon, gaining plenty of victories!

                    This spiritual power is based on Jesus' saying: « Where
               two  or  three  gather  together  in  my  name,  I  am  there  with
               them » (Mt. 18, 20). If Jesus Christ is with us, does it matter
               that  we  are  few?  Not  at  all.  This  kind  of  fortress  does  not
               depend  on  numbers.  Jesus  Christ  said  that  two  or  three
               persons who gather in his name, who are strict followers of
               his word, who are lovers of him, are enough! He is with them!

                    Oh! What a great consolation this statement brings to us!
               We are a little, an insignificant flock, but Christ is saying to us,
               « Do not be afraid, little flock (Lc. 12, 32; as long as you are
               with me, I am with you! »  And if God]]></page><page Index="40"><![CDATA[is with us, who  can be against (Ram. 8. 31)? (Speech, April
               21, 1925).

                    By  committing ourselves  to  the  service  of our  Lord,  by
               pleasing  him  in  everything,  by  glorifying  him  through  our
               sanctification and the sanctification of our neighbor, we draw
               God's  continuous  blessings  upon  the  institute  and  the
               communities, which will grow from nothing, becoming fruitful
               trees in the holy Church. To be specific, with all my heart I
               exhort  you  to  beware  of  any  sin,  even  the  least  one!  If  by
               human weakness or by surprise, a person happens to sin or
               to  be  at  fault,  she  must  not  became  disheartened  or  lose
               confidence, following the devil's suggestion; on the contrary,
               with quiet humility and pious confidence she must rise, beg
               pardon  from  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  whose  mercy  is
               infinite, apply a remedy (if it is necessary), go to confession,
               and recommence the practice of virtues with renewed energy,
               always  imploring  God's  help.  Thus,  the  soul  groves  in  the
               holy fear of Gad, who is the foundation of all wisdom, since
               no  wisdom  is  better  than  the  one  that  prevents  us  from
               offending God, even in the least (Letter, Feb. 13, 1922).   40

                    Blessed daughters, you see how many small trees are
               rising in the Church of our Lord; they take different shapes,
               but all of them are beautiful. They give new  fruits for Jesus
               and souls... Who knows whether divine mercy wants to bless
               this seed, this little grain, making it grow in the holy Church's
               garden!  Due  to  my  sins  and  defects,  I  am  unworthy  of  so
               much; you, however, pray the Lord to continue giving you the
               means of sanctification that he has granted until now.

                    If you zealously practice holy virtues, especially the daily
               little ones; if you love your rule, your name, and]]></page><page Index="41"><![CDATA[your emblem, we have ground to hope that the little seed will
               fructify.

                    Pray  to  the  Lord  of  the  harvest:  this  is  your  emblem.
               Persevere praying to him, letting the spirit of this prayer grow
               in you, for it is fecund, and will produce much good. Those
               who  win  good  workers  to  the holy  Church will  be  rewarded
               (Letter, May 13, 1889).


                      3. RULE BOTH FLEXIBLE... AND RIGOROUS

                    I accept the two postulants you proposed... However, I
               let you know that I am going to put them to the test, with your
               approval,  because  we  must  be  sure  that  they  are  apt  and
               have the vocation for the regular discipline. A person may be
               a  pious,  good,  devout,  excellent  woman,  and  at  the  same
               time  she  may  be  unqualified  far  a  religious community,  still
               less  for  a  nascent  community,  Where  the  sacrifices  are
               double. Likewise double are the merits of the first members,
               who are like the foundresses.                             41

                    Even  though  my  institute's  rule  is  not  rigorous,  we  are
               seriously concerned about obedience, respect and subjection
               to  the  superior,  education  and  mutual  fine  manners,  and
               exact fulfillment of one's own duty. We require that the youths
               be detached from everything, even from personal devotions,
               being ready for self-denial. In short, the rule is moderate in its
               external  penance,  but  it  is  severe  about  the  formation  of
               interior  virtues.  We  inform  the  candidates  for  religious  lift
               about  it  beforehand,  because  being  dismissed  for  lack  of
               observance  is  painful  for  a  postulant  who  has  entered  the
               institute with fervor: furthermore, their leaving often results in
               prejudice to the institute, because the former candidates say
               that they were not to blame for their leaving (of course!), but it
               was  the  fault  of  the  institute,  Which  made  it  impossible  to
               remain. Thus, vocations are discouraged.]]></page><page Index="42"><![CDATA[Experience  has  taught  me  all  this;  so,  when  the  pos-
               tulants request admission into the order I meet with them and
               question them so as to form an idea from the whole. I am not
               appeased by their so many declarations and promises. It is
               obvious that we can be mistaken; far this reason we receive
               the  petitioners  for  one  year  as  aspirants,  another  year  as
               postulants, and two more years as novices (Letter, Aug. 28,
               1902).


                                4. ROGATIONIST VOW

                    This  year,  Jesus  in  the  Holy  Sacrament  will  teach  you
               another thing. Last year he taught you how to live as faithful
               subjects in his little kingdom, giving you the gift of persevering
               in his service, when others abandoned it. His title being the
               Highest Pontiff (3) this year, he will teach you how to fulfill the
               great mission of winning good workers far the holy Church.
               Our Lord Jesus Christ is so kind and merciful that he entrusts
               you,  who  are  humble  and  poor  creatures,  with  this  sacred,
               sublime task. Really, it is a divine mission! The point is that a   42
               miserable  little  poor  creature  becomes  a  mother  of
               innumerable souls; furthermore, she reaches a greater glory
               by spiritually begetting priests to the holy Church!

                    I  feel  myself  confused,  full  of  admiration  toward  divine
               goodness!  It  has  been  since  yesterday  that  I  am  being
               enlightened  about  your  vocation.  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's
               command: « Pray, therefore » , etc., which adorns your poor
               garb of Little Poor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, shows the
               aim of your vacation. You must pray to win the good workers
               for the holy Church, and work to win them... We will not be
               satisfied  by  prayer  alone,  so  we  will  combine  work  with
               prayer:  we  will  combine  prayer  with  an  active  life,  always
               aiming at winning good workers far the holy Church.]]></page><page Index="43"><![CDATA[My  dear  daughters,  the  most  beautiful  field  of  perfect,
               charitable works is open before you. If the good Jesus does
               not look an my sins, but blesses you, your vocation is formed
               and  the  zeal  is  heady,  the  zeal  for  the  interests  of  Jesus'
               Heart who demands prayer to win good workers for the holy
               Church,  which  farms  the  fourth  vow.  «  The  zeal  of  your
               house, God, burns in me like a fire » (John 2, 17).

                    Whether contemplating or working, the Little Poor of the
               Heart of Jesus will be always aware of this aim. In the choir
               she  will  implore  God  to  send  out  goad  workers  to  the  hilly
               Church; in her teaching the orphans, she will teach the prayer
               for winning the good workers; in her begging she will wear on
               her chest ,the badge reading, « Pray, therefore, to the owner
               of  the  harvest  »;  and  when  people  ask  the  meaning  of  the
               reading, she will explain it and spread the vocation prayer.

                    The Little Poor of the Heart of Jesus will do more: taking
               from  her  collection  of  alms  end  from  her  work  only  what  is
               necessary to live a really poor life, she will use the surplus to
               help the needy clerics and to form the sacred patrimonies for   43
               them.  (4)  Really,  this  is  a  divine  mission  and  a  great
               revelation that the most holy Heart of Jesus has given to four
               or five prior creatures in his mercy and charity.

                    Blessed daughters, this is the enlightenment about your
               vacation  that  the  Lord  gave  me  I  yesterday,  after  so  many
               years of darkness, while we were dedicating the title Highest
               Pontiff to him, who is the eternal chief of the priests.

                    Now I have nothing else to say to you but to exhort you
               to pray always so that we may Meet the divine will perfectly
               (Letter, July 2, 1888).]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[5. BUILDING STONES, NOT ROOM FURNITURE


                    The divine Hearts of Jesus and Mary long for generous
               souls.

                    Forming a religious community is an effective means to
               foster God's glory and the salvation of souls. Because union
               is strength, the formation of a religious community makes hell
               shudder, but the angels rejoice. When a religious community
               is formed, the first vocations are like the building stones, and
               the first members are, neither more nor less, the foundresses
               of the religious institute, sharing in the goad the institute will
               accomplish in the future (Letter, March 25, 1913).

                    Unfortunately, vocations usually happen to be opposed;
               but when it concerns a nascent institute, opposition is more
               passionate and more arrogant through various pretexts such
               as saying that the institute is not yet formed, that its future is
               uncertain,  and  the  like.  The  people  arguing  in  such  a  way
               forget that no institute is perfectly formed at its beginning, that   44
               the institute needs good vocations to be formed, and that they
               are working against the formation of the institute by opposing
               vocations. Joining a nascent religious institute sometimes is
               more  deserving  thin  joining  a  formed  one;  indeed,  the  first
               members  are  like  the  first  building  stones.  They  are  the
               founders of the order; they beforehand prepare the institute's
               future  glory.  Through  their  work  and  sacrifice  they  lay  the
               foundation  stones,  preparing  the  treasure  of  grace  for  the
               following members! Oh, if the people pondered on this matter,
               many  candidates  for  religious  life  would  prefer  a  nascent
               institute to a formed one, provided that good dedication and
               holy  aim  are  sure  (On  Fr.  Bonarrigo's  death;  «  God  and
               Neighbor », March 1910).

                    The people who joined a nascent community in the]]></page><page Index="45"><![CDATA[period of its foundation are the building stones, not the roam
               furniture. Since their sacrifice is nobler, their merit is double
               before the Lord; in fact, they prepare the salvation-home for
               the  future  members  by  building  the  ship  that  will  save  so
               many  people.  Any  community  which  is  formed  had  this
               beginning and these foundresses. At its starting each institute
               had  generous  persons  who  did  not  say  that  the  community
               was unworthy of their trust because it was a nascent one, or
               that it was better for them to choose a formed community. I
               Had the first vocations reasoned so, the community would be
               never formed. Therefore those who had faith and courage to
               love,  and  who  joined  the  unknown  or  perhaps  despised
               community, were the foundresses; their name an memory will
               last as a blessing in the institute.

                    Now then, here is the nascent, new-born community that
               comes  forth  in  the  Church  with  this  name:  Daughters  of
               Divine  Zeal.  The  institute  already  enjoys  the  most  elect
               blessings from the sacred prelates of the holy Church. But the
               community  needs  vocations:  to  grow!  It  needs  generous,
               intelligent people who understand not only the sacred mission   45
               of charity toward their neighbor, but also the divine word that
               makes the institute unique and singular: « Pray, therefore... »
               (Letter, without date.

                    Let us remember the institution at its very beginning, the
               long period of work, want, and sacrifices as it is common at
               the beginning of such enterprises. More than ever it is at its
               beginning that the institute needs generous people who are
               willing to immolate themselves for divine glory, with faith and
               courage,  daring  to  be  the  foundation  stones  of  the  building
               that  the  omnipotent  arm  of  God  wants  to  raise.  Devoting
               oneself to the Lord in a religious order that is already formed
               is easy; but asking for admittance to a nascent order that is]]></page><page Index="46"><![CDATA[nothing but an effort, an impulse of faith, a longing for, and an
               interlacing  of  hard  difficulties,  is  hard.  Only  a  singular,
               generous,  priceless  vocation  does  that.  The  first  vocations
               are  not  fellows,  but  foundresses.  How  marvelous  are  the
               ways of Providence! Such souls are needed at the beginning
               of an institute, when nearly all the vocations shun and avoid it
               (Speech, Aug. 16, 1926). (5)


                            6. I AM BLACK BUT BEAUTIFUL

                    Our least institute lacks the saint founder (6) - mystery of
               God!  -  However,  our  Lord  himself  seems  to  have
               accomplished everything from the time he printed the divine
               word. « Pray, therefore! » - hidden in the gospel for so many
               centuries - on the forehead of this nascent institute, by a flash
               of his infinite goodness.

                    This least institute can say: I am black but beautiful. I am
               black because of the starter who hindered my progress and
               because  of  the  contradictions  surrounding  me;  but  I  am   46
               beautiful because of the shining reflection of the command of
               Jesus' divine zeal, the ceaseless wail oaf the prayer that I am
               spreading widely everywhere, and the most holy longing for
               seeing  the  holy  Church  rich  with  workers  according  to  the
               heart  of  God.  I  am  beautiful  for  the  Sacred  Alliance  of  so
               many prelates of the holy Church, who bless me copiously,
               offering me to God during the sacrifice of the mass; at last I
               am beautiful because of the orphans I am rescuing, and the
               poor I aim feeding and evangelizing.

                    But  so  that  the  fire may  continue  burning,  it  needs  fire
               (Letter, March 25, 1913)!

                    I  am  black,  because  of  the  contradictions...  Everyone
               knows  the  serious  difficulties  opposing  the  Lord's  works;
               humanly  speaking,  these  difficulties  sometimes  seem  in-
               superable.]]></page><page Index="47"><![CDATA[The person who starts such institutions has to fight four
               battles:

                    1.  He  has  to  fight against  those  who  oppose  him,  and
               the external oppositions such as censures, persecutions, and
               disapprovals sometimes coming from good people. Some of
               them  say  that  the  person  starting  such  institutions  is  mad;
               others say that the work will came to nothing with his death,
               while  the  lack  of  resources,  want,  defections,  ingratitude,  a
               hundred difficulties, and vicissitudes make matters worse.

                    2. The starter has to fight with himself. He grows feeble,
               seems  to  fail,  sees  the  enterprise  as  though  it  were
               unattainable  owing  to  his  spiritual  weakness.  On  the  other
               hand,   the   enterprise   requires,   strength,   sacrifice,
               perseverance,  faith,  confidence,  sacred  enthusiasm,  want,
               tolerance, prudence, longanimity, and dissimulation; in short,
               self-denial is to be practiced at any moment.

                    3. Meanwhile one fighter is battling by day and by night,
               extrinsically  and  intrinsically,  by  means  of  other  human   47
               beings and our own passions: he is Satan! The battle against
               the  power  of  darkness  is  so  hard  and  tremendous  that  the
               apostle St. Paul aid: « For we are not fighting against human
               beings, but against the wicked spiritual forces in the heavenly
               world, the rulers, authorities, and cosmic powers of this dark
               ale » (Eph. 6, 12).

                    Satan fears nothing else as much as the foundation of a
               charitable  or  religious  institution  which  aims  at  God's  glory
               and salvation of souls. Such a foundation for him, is like the
               foundation  of  the  Church:  the  anger  and  the  fury  which
               blinded him at the Church's birth return. What doesn't hell try
               to  preclude  the  foundation  of  such  institutes?  To  resist and
               overcome  the  hellish  powers,  people  need  to  provide
               themselves with God's help, the]]></page><page Index="48"><![CDATA[weapons  of  faith,  Christian  wisdom,  prayer,  pure  intention,
               honest conscience, and wise counsels.

                    4.  But  a  very  surprising  battle  defies  the  institute's
               starter: it is the battle Jacob fought with the angel, with God.
               Even though the founder is nothing else but a weak, useless
               tool, since only God is the author of any good work, still God
               works on with this tool! But He wants immolation, and Jesus
               wants us to imitate him. Our Savior fought with the justice of
               his eternal Father when « he made his prayers and requests
               with loud cries and tears to God » (Heb. 5, 7). He did so all
               his life long, on the mountains and in the graves, immolating
               himself on the altar of his divine heart. In his terrible agonies,
               he prayed even more fervently (Lc. 22, 43); so did he while
               combining  his  blood  with  his  burning  tears  until  his  last
               breath. The prophet had foretold: « Would anyone plead his
               cause? Yes, he was torn away from the  land of the living »
               (Is. 53, 8).

                     God  shapes  the  institute  and  its  members  through
               privation,  wails,  sobs,  and  sacrifice;  with  one  hand  he   48
               sustains the feeble tool, with the other he trains the tool for
               the fight; with one hand he gives the necessary help, with the
               other he bars additional help, often blocking the way with cut
               stoned  as  the  prophet  Jeremiah  complained:  «  He  has
               blacked my ways with cut stones, he has obstructed my paths
               » (Jer. Lam. 3, 9).

                    In  the  midst  of  these  troubles  man  comes  to  know  his
               inability, his nothingness; he begins to distrust, to humiliate,
               and debase himself; he realizes that he is an obstacle to any
               good,  and  as  Moses,  he  perhaps  implores,  «  Lord,  send
               anyone you will » (Ex. 4, 13). All paths seem closed. Heaven
               seems defiant, a thousand doubts call in question the work,
               as  an  output  of  foolhardiness  and  over-confidence,  even
               prayer seems useless.]]></page><page Index="49"><![CDATA[God  seems  to  have  withdrawn  himself  in  order  to  punish
               infidelity,  interposing  a  cloud  so  that  prayer  may  not  reach
               him. According to the prophet Jeremiah's saying: « You have
               wrapped yourself in  a cloud too thick for prayer to pierce »
               (Jer. Lam. 3, 44 ). And yet, that is the proper time to wail and
               sob  before  divine  mercy  from  the  profound  abyss  of  one's
               own misery, « for we do not know how we ought to pray; the
               Spirit  himself  pleads  with  God  for  us,  in  groans  that  words
               cannot express » (Rom. 8, 26).

                    That is the time to uphold God's wise delays: « Cling to
               him and do not leave him » (Eccl. 2, 3); this is the proper time
               to endure the mysterious battle for self annihilation, the time
               of wails, sobs, petitions, and any sacrifice so that these wards
               of  the  Psalmist,  «  put  your  hope  in  Yahweh,  be  strong,  let
               your heart be bold » (Ps. 27, 14) may come true.

                    At  last,  the  fight  with  the  angel  finds  with  a  strong
               embrace, but Jacob states, « I will not let you go, unless you
               bless  me  »  (Gen.  32,  26).  The  event  comes  to  terms  with
               copious, divine blessings, which re as much abundant as long   49
               and hard is the mysterious fight.

                    It  was  God  who  was  planting,  not  people  (Precious
               Adhesions, pages 6-8).

                    The  four  difficulties,  which  surrounded  this  little  char-
               itable institute since its start, have been growing, always with
               more  complication  of  things  ands  the  interlacing  of
               circumstances. The institute has been surrounded by a vortex
               of tribulations which brought it at the point of death a hundred
               times  before  being  completely  born.  How  many  times  I  felt
               myself exclaiming, « the waters went over my head; I said: I
               am lost » (Jer. Lam. 3, 54)... We continued sailing in the open
               sea in the midst of light and darkness when, in a few years,
               besides lack of resources,]]></page><page Index="50"><![CDATA[desertions,  and  misunderstanding,  the  tide  of  the  torments,
               oppositions,  and  difficulties  climbed  so  high  that  the
               shipwreck  seemed  impending  and  unavoidable.  I  said  with
               the prophet: « have stepped into deep water and the waves
               are  washing  over  me  »  (Ps.  69,  2).  (Precious  Adhesions,
               1903, pages 6-8).

                    By grace of God, faith began to prevail. I said: if we seek
               God and immolate ourselves far the good of souls, for good
               results, far sanctification, and salvation, the Lord will provide
               for  everything.  Piety,  prayer,  meditation,  work,  special  and
               effective  devotions,  which  we  label  devout,  new,  singular,
               fecund industries, were the pious institute's great resources in
               those  events.  We  hope  that  they  will  continue  (Precious
               Adhesions, page 6).

                    When everything in our enterprises seems to be upside
               down,  the  only  comfort  is  submission  to  divine  will,  which
               guides  everything  to  good  results,  even  though  we  do  not
               understand. The people who have experienced it known how
               dearly  one  pays  for  being  submissive.  In  my  case  a   50
               circumstance  made  the  cup  more  bitter;  I  had  to  submit
               myself  to  the  idea  of  losing  the  aim  of an  institute  which  is
               committed  to  the  most  holy,  celestial  command:  «  Pray,
               therefore »; I had to refold the sacred banner which makes
               the most holy Heart of Jesus' tender utterance shine and to
               which the salvation of souls is very likely connected through
               the  shortest,  surest  way  (Preface  to  Precious  Adhesions,
               1903).

                    If  this  community  along  with  the  whole  institute  did  not
               go to ruin; if the little plant tossed by the storm still exists, it is
               mostly due to some faithful people who practiced holy virtues
               with perseverance, giving assistance and obeying for Jesus'
               sake.  The  Lord  requires  many  sacrifices  in  this  pious
               institute's foundation, owing perhaps to its great destiny!]]></page><page Index="51"><![CDATA[Blessed  daughters,  meantime  you  rouse  your  spirit,

                                        NOTES

                   1   «  Asking  God  for  sending  out  workers  to  the  holy  Church
               means imploring that he send priests according to his heart as well
               as  male  and  female  Religious,  lay  people  full  of  God’s  spirit  and
               zealous for the salvation of souls. For instance, it is obvious that the
               following  people  are  holy  workers  in  the  mystical  harvest:  the
               educators of youth; parents taking care of their children's Christian
               and civil education, wealthy persons investing money for God's glory
               and the goad of souls, Catholic journalists fighting for holy religion
               within  proper  limits,  any  one  cooperating  with  funds  or  prayer  or
               individual holiness for Gads glory and the goad of souls. »

                   2   Here  our  padre  is  simplifying  and  synthesizing;  in  fact,  we
               know how many sorrows he endured and how many tears he shed   51
               for  the  foundation  of  the  twin  orders;  even  their  names  were  the
               outcome  of  long  reflections  and  prayers  (See  VITALE,  «  Fr.  M.
               Hannibal Di Francia etc. », pages 154-155).

                   3  This Is the Eucharistic title of 1888; in 1887 the title was King.

                   4  Our  padre  was  writing  in  1888,  when  the  Rogationists  order
               was not yet born.

                   5  Obviously, now our orders are not at their start any longer, but
               if we  are  faithful  and  generous, the  grace  of the beginning  will  be
               also granted to us. Let us read St. Theresa's idea on this topic: « I
               often hear some people say that at the religious orders' beginning
               God granted more graces to the saints founders. That is true; how-
               ever, we cannot help realizing that the living are the foundation of
               the new generations. If we and our successors will imitate the fervor
               of the previous Religious, the institute will always stand firm. Does
               the predecessors' holiness matter to me, if I am so miserable as to
               ruin  the  house  through  my  bad  habits?  It  is  obvious  that  the  new
               comers  follow  more  the  pattern  of  those  who  are  living  than  the
               pattern of those who are dead. It's odd putting the blame on the]]></page><page Index="52"><![CDATA[fact that I am not one of thè first! Why don't I  think of my lite and

                            LOVE FOR JESUS AND MARY


                   To reciprocate the great divine mercy, with the help
               of grace and my own good will, I declare that I will devote
               myself to the practice of the religious virtues, especially
               the ones forming « inner life », such as:

                   1.  Humility  of  heart.  Through  the  practice  of  this
               virtue  I  will  be  always  aware  of  being  nothing,  and  the
               last among the order's fellow-members.

                   2. Constant practice of divine presence and love. The
               only  aim  in  my  actions  and  life  will  be  Jesus:  loving
               Jesus as much as he deserves, sighing for him, pleasing
               him in everything, and belonging to Jesus with the most
               fervent  love,  and  with  the  perfect  union  of  his  and  my
               will. Through lively faith I will contemplate Jesus in the
               Innermost depth of my heart where he dwells, urges me     53
               to  love  him,  asks  for  love,  attracts  me,  longs  for  being
               one  with  me,  and  grieves  so  much  every  time  I  do  not
               make up for my faults.

                   I  will  listen  to  him  talking  in  my  spirit,  asking  for
               souls, and for sacrifice out of love for him and for souls.
               By only pronouncing the name of Jesus I will be aware of
               his  presence.  It  will  revive  my  motives  to  love  him  by
               recalling  to  mind  the  following:  that  he  created,
               redeemed,  and  called  me;  that  he  has  granted  me  so
               many  favors;  that  I  belong  to  him  as  a  priest.  While
               pronouncing  or  hearing  the  sweetest  name  of  Jesus,  I
               will also bow my head.

                   3. After Jesus and in Jesus I will love his most holy
               mother, whose devotion forms a particular characteristic
               of this pious Institute, to my great consolation.]]></page><page Index="54"><![CDATA[1. INTERIOR VIRTUE

                       The rules are norms governing the external actions;
               but  unless  they  are  joined  by  interior  life,  external  actions
               alone are of little avail.

                       The aspirant must have an upright, pure intention of
               achieving  his  own  sanctification  for  God's  glory  and  the
               salvation of souls. He will be living in the presence of God,
               having Jesus Christ in his mind, in his heart, in his actions, in
               his words, and in his desires. Belonging totally to Jesus will
               be the only aim of the aspirant's life.

                       To  achieve  this  goal,  the  aspirant  must  carefully
               beware of  any  sin,  hating  either the mortal or  venial  one  in
               order to avoid causing grief to the most holy Heart of Jesus
               (R.A.).

                       Because  external  observance  of  the  rules  cannot
               endure  without  internal  virtue,  each  congregant  will  seek  to
               attain  spiritual  union  with  God.  They  will  endeavor  to  be   54
               always  in  his  presence  and  to  please  him  entirely  by doing
               everything  for  Jesus,  and  by  seeking  God alone  with  virtue
               and pure intention. It is necessary to be a person of prayer
               and penance, meditating on the adorable Lord Jesus Christ
               every day, mortifying the senses especially those of gluttony
               and hearing, keeping external and internal silence, and being
               detached from everything and everybody; even from oneself
               (C.R.).

                       To faithfully fulfill the Rogate's divine command and
               to become worthy of propagating it, we must work toward our
               own  sanctification  by  practicing  evangelical  and  priestly
               virtues, by regular observance and discipline, and by prayer
               and  spiritual  reading.  To  became  spiritual persons  we  must
               mortify  our  sensual  self  sedulously,  doing  our  utmost  to
               achieve internal virtue and the pure intention of pleasing God
               alone, to be detached from any earthly]]></page><page Index="55"><![CDATA[affection,  and  to  devote  ourselves  entirely  to  the  love  of

               holy  Church,  we  first  must  be  good  workers  in  the mystical
               harvest by looking after our sanctification, the sanctification of
               the  people,  and  their  goodness.  As  the  elect  priesthood  of
               Jesus Christ in the world wish God's glory and the good of all
               the people, so also shall we do (R.R.C.).

                    Dearest  daughters,  I  recommend  you  to  answer  the
               grace of the Lard, who is calling you to holiness. He is calling
               you to belong totally to Jesus, and to become the first stones
               of the building that he is raising. Because God makes use of
               poor,  weak  tools,  He  chose  you,  the  poor;  but  if  someone
               does not answer the call faithfully and humbly, He will reject

               superiors as representatives of the most holy Virgin by loving

               No  one  will  live  according  to  her  own  will, but  according  to
               obedience. Daughters in Jesus Christ, I recommend growth in
               the  spiritual  life  and  union  with  Jesus  by  humiliating
               yourselves, obeying, and working for his sake. Love our most
               holy mother Mary to the utmost, and appeal to the angels and
               the saints with faith and love (D.S.S.).

               they  be  simple  and  sincere,  avoiding  any  lie,  which  is  the
               souls' ruin. Let them involve themselves in winning souls to

               (D.S.S.).

                    The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  novices  will  diligently
               adorn their soul with holy virtues.

                    Considering  how  precious  the  virtues  are,  they  will
               meditate  on  the  examples  that  our  Lord,  his  most  holy
               mother, and the saints have given us. They will long far and
               struggle  hard  to  become  humble,  for  holy  humility  is  the
               foundation of the virtues, and to achieve perfect obedience,
               the  short  and  sure  way  to  holiness,  and  meekness,  which
               edifies and sanctifies.

                    They will be patient, silent, recollected, modest, fond of
               prayer and spiritual reading, finding their spiritual nourishment
               in  confident,  humble  prayer.  Disposed  to  accepting
               correction,  they  will  be  able  to  accuse  and  despise
               themselves,  and  to  long  for  the  last  place  and  things  as
               humble  servants  of  the  community.  Always  aware  of  God's
               presence,  they  will  do  everything  with  the  pure  intention  of   56
               seeking God and Jesus alone, and of pleasing Jesus and his
               mother. They will be active, vigilant, diligent, and industrious.

                    While  performing  their  religious  duties,  the  novices  will
               be recollected in the presence of God (From the beginning of
               the Rules for the novices of Oria).

                    Religious  virtues  and the practice  of  divine  love  will  be
               the  rules  for  the  novices.  To  grow  in  the  love  of  Jesus,
               supreme goodness, they will do and suffer everything for his
               sake. They will think of him, meditate on his life, his Passion,
               his  death,  and  on  the  mysteries  of  his  infinite  love.  Always
               keeping in mind the adorable, divine Savior they will meditate
               especially  on  the  pain  of  his  divine  Heart.  They  must  be
               loving souls. If they are, love will make them strong in their
               suffering, in their work, and in their immolation, leading them
               to the divine union,]]></page><page Index="57"><![CDATA[which is the aim of their suffering and work. (1)  They must
               always ask the most holy Heart of Jesus for his love, the love
               of the most holy Virgin, and other holy loves. The perfection
               of law is love. Happy is the silent, humble, meek, industrious,
               and diligent novice who burns with love for Jesus and sighs
               with love for him. Out of love for Jesus, and to grow in it, she
               humiliates herself, she obeys, she suffers, she does penance,
               she prays, and she works. She is aware of the least defect, is
               devoted to the perfect observance of the rules, as well as to
               the  practice  of  the  holy  virtues.  The  celestial  groom  invites
               her  saying,  «  Come  my  beloved,  my  dove,  you  shall  be
               crowned » (R.N.).

                    Spiritual  life  includes  works  that  are  invisible  to  the
               human sight, but they are the secret of the priestly, episcopal,
               and  apostolical  action;  they  are  the  efficient  cause  oaf  the
               most  charitable  institutions,  the  fire,  which  produces  the
               energy,  and  the  driving  power  which  moves  all  things.  Ah!
               Without  the  interior  fire,  which  we  call  spiritual  life,  neither
               prayer  nor  penance,  nor  any  relationship  between  creature
               and Creator, nor a loving union of the soul with God may be   57
               achieved.  No  redeeming  ward  can  be  said  to  conquer  the
               hearts,  no  truly  useful,  lasting  beneficence  can  be
               accomplished. Without this fire, any struggle can be summed
               in  this  statement  of  the  apostle:  «  I  have  become  like  one
               beating  the  air,  like  an  instrument,  whose  sound  makes  a
               vanishing noise » (Speech, April 17, 1915).

                    What  does  it  mean  to  be  holy?  God  wants  it,  and  the
               apostle put it in these terms: « This is God's will for you: he
               wants you to be holy » (1 Thes. 4, 3).

                    In  the  shallow  view  of  some  people,  true  holiness  is
               always surrounded by severe penances, great manifestation
               of transcendental happenings, and first rate miracles,]]></page><page Index="58"><![CDATA[but they are mistaken, True holiness is perfect union of our
               will  with  God's  will  out  of  love  and  with  pure  intention  of
               pleasing Him. When a person reaches this happiest state, he
               longs  only  to  remain  hidden  in  God,  and  sometimes  he
               reaches this goal without being aware of it.

                    To work miracles by halting natural laws is unnecessary
               for this person, because he has worked the greatest miracle
               by giving himself up to God. People can say that his glory is
               from  inside  (Ps.  44,  13),  and  he  can  answer:  «  My  life  is
               hidden with Christ in God » (Col. 3, 3).

                    Jesus  has  said,  «  every  tree  is  known  by  the  fruit  it
               bears,  and  a  healthy  tree  bears  good  fruit. »  It  follows  that
               simple  and  hidden  as  a  person's  holiness  may  be,  it  is
               unavoidable that its clearest signs are perceived by people in
               the long run, and in same circumstances. Recollection, mind
               always fixed an God, human will always standing fast in the
               divine  will,  purest  intention,  chastity,  and  hidden  holiness
               cannot help transpiring outside. The people perceive it in his
               modest look, in his gentle words and actions, in his upright,   58
               wise, prudent talking, in his constant patience and uniformity
               in  the  midst  of  the  human  events.  The  people  perceive  it
               always mare in his loving, sincere, effusive charity, especially
               in his charity toward the offenders. If this person lives under a
               rule,  the  hidden  treasure  transpires  through  his  perfect,
               scrupulous observance and in the prompt, faithful obedience
               to the superiors. Despite whatever effort, the burning fire of
               divine love cannot be hidden.

                    Elect  and  lucky  people of  any  state and  condition  who
               are  holding the fire of  divine  love  in  your  heart,  the  Church
               says of you: « May your charity burn with fire and your ardor
               kindle your neighbor » (Speech, Nov. 5, 1907).]]></page><page Index="59"><![CDATA[2. HUMILITY

                    Indispensable means to obtain divine grace and eternal
               salvation is the virtue or disposition we call humility.

                    A definition of this great virtue is as clear as it is simple:
               humility  is  quite  the  reverse  of  pride.  Since no  one  likes  to
               appear  haughty,  everyone  blames  pride.  Pride  inflates  the
               person's heart; it makes us believe that we are so great and
               so endowed with understanding, and with so many moral and
               natural  gifts,  that  we  can  do  without  teachers,  and  even
               without God! On the contrary, humility makes us believe that
               God is the supreme being to wham we must be subject, that
               our natural, moral, and intellectual gifts depend an God, who
               can, deprive us of them. The Apostle St. Paul wrote: « Didn't
               God give you everything you have? Well, then, how can you
               brag, as if what you have were not a gift? » (1. Cor. 4, 7).

                    Humility  makes  us  depend  on  God,  his  holy  laws,  and
               somehow  on  those  who  represent  Jesus  Christ  in  civil  and
               ecclesiastical societies.                                 59

                    Jesus  taught  us  this  great  virtue  with  words  and
               examples. In spite of being and remaining God, he became a
               man  submitting  himself  to  Mary  and  Joseph,  who  were  his
               creatures: « He was obedient to them, » says the evangelist.
               Later, he let his enemies take him to the tribunals, suffering
               affronts, derision, slaps, and even the infamous death on the
               cross  in  the  middle  of  two  thieves.  He  had  said  to  his
               disciples: « Learn from me, because I am gentle and humble
               in spirit » (Mt. 11, 29).

                    Divine  grace,  which  is  granted  through  humility,  is
               indispensable to reach eternal salvation.

                    If our divine Savior degraded and humiliated himself far
               our sake up to the death on the cross in order to sweep away
               the pride that Lucifer introduced in human]]></page><page Index="60"><![CDATA[hearts,  and  to  convince  us  to  be  humble,  how  can  he
               introduce in his kingdom those who do not want to be subject
               to his law, and to his divine will?

                    What are we, compared with the Creator of heaven and
               earth, but an imperceptible atom? What madness it is to set
               ourselves up above God!

                    My Lord, we humiliate ourselves before you with loving
               humility.  I  said  with  loving  humility,  because  love  often  has
               the power to subdue the lover to the beloved with free, joyous
               humility,  as  we  experience  in  the  world.  I  said  with  loving
               humility,  because  Jesus  Christ  is  our  father and  we  are  his
               children;  he  is  so  loving,  indulgent,  and  benign  with  those
               who love him and are subjected to him as children are to their
               father!

                    Thinking  of  the  times  we  have  sinned  against  God
               through  words  and  actions  is  a  great  motive  for  humiliating
               ourselves  before  Him.  Haw  many  times  we  forgot,  ignored,
               and neglected God despite the fact that he endows our soul   60
               and our body with so many gifts, and loves us immensely!

                    If we happen to offend a person who loves and helps us,
               we feel we have to apologize and beg pardon.

                    As for me, my Lord and friend, whom I love so much, I
               glory in being lovingly subject to my Lord Jesus Christ, to his
               law,  and,  relatively,  to  the  ecclesiastical  or  lay  people  who
               have power over me. I think of myself as of a sinner needing
               and begging divine forgiveness from the lowing God; kneeling
               at his feet I think of being nothing and in need of divine help,
               which I implore with clasped hands. I feel myself truly longing
               for eternal salvation, which I beg from my Lord Jesus Christ
               for  myself,  for  you,  and  far  all  people  with  the  most  ardent
               sighs of my heart.

                    My  lord  and  brother  in  Jesus  Christ,  do  not  dislike
               kneeling before the loving, sweet Jesus, who is our brother]]></page><page Index="61"><![CDATA[in  human  nature,  but  eternal,  infinite,  omnipotent  God  in
               divinity.

                    You  may  consider  haw  many  personalities  and  haw
               many highnesses did not dislike bending toward the dishonor
               of  Golgotha,  who  practiced  the  religious  devotions  that  so
               many people flee from as though they were suitable only to
               simple women and weak souls (Letter to the Friends)!

                    The preciousness of this virtue was unknown before our
               Lord Jesus Christ's coming. But when God-man washed the
               apostles'  feet  and  died  with  shame  as  a  criminal  on  the
               infamous cross in the middle of two thieves, humility became
               a precious virtue.

                    Some  people  think  of  humility  as  dejection,  while  it  is
               quite the reverse: humility makes us grow and lifts us up to
               Gad.  Besides  being  the  death  of  pride,  ambition,  and
               arrogance, the passions that vilify the person, humility makes
               us kind, prudent, and agreeable. While arrogance makes us
               odious, humility wins everyone's esteem for us by making us   61
               restrain from boasting and despising, because it is mother of
               modesty and prudence.

                    Since  «  God  resists  the  proud,  but  gives  grace  to  the
               humble » (1 Pt. 5, 5), it is impossible to obtain graces from
               Gad without humility (Letter to the friends).

                    Even  though  we  do  not  take  a  vow  of  humility,  -  it  is
               included in obedience and poverty and it is the foundation of
               the  religious  virtues  -  even  so,  we  Rogationists  have  to
               cultivate it in a special way. We must endeavor to be interiorly
               humble by acknowledging our nothingness and by attributing
               everything  we  do  to  God.  Because  our  failures  waste
               everything,  we  are  always debtors  to  God  for  any good  we
               accomplish,  and  we  must  show  our  gratitude  to  Him  in
               humble words and behavior. Each one will love the last place,
               the humblest things, and the]]></page><page Index="62"><![CDATA[vilest jobs according to the teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ.
               When  someone  is  reproached  or  admonished,  he  will  not
               excuse himself but will humbly accept everything and amend;
               if  necessary,  he  may  explain  his  motives  once.  Each
               fellow-member  will  meditate,  or  at  least  be  aware  of  the
               shame  and  infamy  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  endured  in  his
               Passion for our sins and will accustom himself to love infamy
               and contempt as the greatest spiritual goods. Submission of
               one's  own  will  to  the  superior,  and  detachment  from  one's
               own opinion belong to the virtue of holy humility (C.R.).

                    Humility contest. (2)  Even though this sublime contest is
               concerned  with  exterior  behavior,  still  it  fosters  the
               community's edification and one's own sanctification.

                    To  foster  good  external  behavior,  the  people  must
               combine  it  with  the  internal  attitude  of  humility,  mortifying
               themselves  interiorly,  acknowledging  their  weakness,  and
               punishing their selfishness with acts of external humility with
               our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  divine  humility,  practicing  them  in
               perfect  union  with  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  and  trying  to   62
               imitate  the  great  mother  of  God's  attitude,  she  who  is  the
               humblest  among  the  creatures.  Till  the  end  of  the  contest,
               every day they will ask the adorable heart of Jesus, the mast
               holy  Virgin  Mary,  the  angels  and  the  saints  for  a  particular
               grace  so  that  they  may  properly  train  themselves  in  this
               sublime virtue, which pleases the Hearts of Jesus and Mary
               as much as it disheartens and puts down the devil.

                    During  the  time  contest,  the  people  will  direct  the
               religious  practices,  the actions  in  common,  the  exercises  of
               piety  and  charity  to  the  holy  aim  of  improving  themselves
               through  humility  in  order  to  please  the  mast  holy  Hearts  of
               Jesus and Mary as much as they can.

                        The sisters must be told that the aim of the contest]]></page><page Index="63"><![CDATA[is to be humiliated, not glorified before others; therefore, the
               slaves of the queen of heaven and earth will make use of the
               holy  industries  to  humiliate  themselves,  and  to  remain  the
               humblest among all.

                    Advises:

                    1.  During  the  time  of  the  virtue  contest,  the  spiritual
               reading  in  common  or  in  private  will  be  appropriate  to  the
               specific virtue of the contest.

                    2. The contest is not under pain of sin, and the winner is
               the person who accomplishes everything with mare virtue, not
               the one who does more.


                                3. THE SPIRIT OF THE INSTITUTE

                    The  spirit  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation's  institute  is  the
               spirit oaf charity, zeal, and sacrifice as our Lard Jesus Christ
               manifested it in his earthly life and, as the holy gospels report.   63
               Charity,  zeal,  and  sacrifice,  however,  must  be  founded  on
               humility and meekness of the most holy Heart of Jesus, who
               invites us to imitate these virtues.

                    We  have  to  make  continuous  efforts  to  love  God,  our
               Lord  and  Creator,  with  a  predominant,  strong,  tender,
               constant,  fervent,  active,  compassionate,  effective,  and
               uniting love. Love of Jesus must be the beginning, the object,
               the  end,  and  the  mover  of  our  intentions,  actions,  and
               observance:  Jesus,  everything  in  Jesus,  through  Jesus,  for
               Jesus, and from Jesus. Through Jesus and his divine love we
               have  to  nurture  the  holy  affections  in  our  heart,  along  with
               love  for  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  who  is  the  creature
               predestined  from  among  all  the  others,  the  mother  of  God
               and  ours,  the  mystical  city  of  God,  the  masterpiece  of  his
               omnipotence; also the Patriarch]]></page><page Index="64"><![CDATA[St. Joseph, who is Immaculate Mary's Virgin spouse and the
               Son  of  God's putative  father; as  well  as  the  dearest  angels
               and the saints, whose happy company we hope to enjoy for
               ever.

                    At last, in Jesus along with his pure love, we have to love
               our  neighbor  as  ourselves  with  passionate,  brotherly
               affection, because our neighbor is image of God, our fellow,
               and  touch  stone  of  our  love  far  Jesus;  love  for  God  and
               neighbor  became  one  precept  including  the  law  and  the
               prophets as well. This precept sums up the Old and the New
               Testament, the holy Church's laws, the Fathers, Doctors, and
               ecclesiastical  writers'  works  as  well  as  the  word  that  the
               apostles,  the  martyrs,  and  the  confessors  preached  in  all
               times; in short, everything depends on love of God and love
               of  neighbor  as  of  ourselves':  this  is  charity,  charity  is  God,
               and God is charity (Points of Rules).


                                 4. LET US LOVE GOD
                                                                         64
                    God  is  infinite  goodness,  and  we  must  love  Him.  He
               holds  all  perfections,  beauties,  treasures,  which  we  are
               unable to understand. If we look at nature, we see a faintest
               image of the divine properties. Let us look at space: it is so
               immense that the human mind cannot compute it; still, God is
               more.  Look  at  the  stars:  they  are  millions  and  millions  and
               many  of  them  are  greater  than  earth  a  hundred  thousand
               times;  suspended  in  the  empty  space,  they  orbit  with
               admirable order, stiII they cannot express how powerful God
               is, because he created there with a word and He is able to
               create  as  many  of  them  as  he  wants.  Look  at  nature:  how
               many beauties it has! Beautiful is spring, fragrant the flowers,
               majestic the mountains, pretty the creeks, pleasant the fields,
               mysterious the graves, terrible the oceans: how much beauty
               and variety the author of them holds!]]></page><page Index="65"><![CDATA[The virtues of the saints come from God, who is infinite
               goodness.  He  shows  Himself  to  the  blessed  ones  who  see
               Him face to face, experiencing a loving happiness that differs
               from one another. Without lessening Himself, He rewards the
               merits of the elect by making them contemplate Himself for
               ever as eternally new, despite His being all the same. They
               love Him because He is worthy of being loved, not because
               they  take  pleasure  in  loving  the  infinite  goodness.  Even
               though  He  would  make  them  suffer  eternally,  they  would
               continue loving Him.

                    Now,  then,  if  God  is  infinite  goodness  holding  the
               wholeness of beauty and greatness, does He not deserve our
               love (Speech on the love of God, June 21, 1877)?

                    When  we  consider  that  God  loved  us  with  eternal
               charity, our mind is moved, our heart is touched. We were not
               yet  born  nor  our  parents  nor  our  forefathers,  and  God  was
               loving us. Neither earth nor the sky nor the stars existed, and
               God was loving us.
                                                                         65
                    Do  you  think  God  was  in  need  of  us,  poor  creatures?
               wasn't  He  fully  happy  without  us?  Being  all  the  same  fully
               happy, God did not need us, nor was He obliged to love or
               create us; and yet, He loved our souls so much that He not
               only created, but also redeemed us. He made us in His image
               and when we lost His image because of sin, He sent His only
               son on earth to redeem us. What does this most benign Lord
               demand oaf us for his love? Nothing else but love!

                    Which  merciless  heart  will  deny  love  to  God?  Poor
               creatures!  They  love  everything  but  God!  And  yet,  earthly
               loves are vain, are nothing. Look at the, world and show me
               what God's creature love. Some love money, others clothing;
               some  food, others  property  and  wealth;  some  conversation,
               others glory and honor; some love creatures;]]></page><page Index="66"><![CDATA[and with what profane love, transport, and passion they love
               them! Ah! The main loves blinding human beings are loves of
               self-interest  and  of  creatures.  How.  do  they  sacrifice
               themselves  for  the  sake  of  self-interest  and  of  creatures!
               They  spend  nights,  face  risks,  struggle  for  a  living,  swear,
               work,  and  endanger  their  life!  They  declare to  live  for  each
               other, to share the days, the pains, the sufferings of their life!
               People go so far as to idolize creatures!

                    But happy is the person who is penetrated by the sparkle
               of divine love; happy is the person that out of love lives with
               great  transport,  loving  the  Creator  in  creatures:  instead  of
               loving self-interest, he loves the king of all treasures, instead
               of  loving  vanity,  he  loves  the  eternal  truth!  Happy  is  the
               person who says to the world: « Treacherous world, you do
               not  suit  me!  You  have  nothing  else  but  tribulation  and
               bitterness;  I  have  drunk  from  your  cup  experiencing  hove
               bitter it is; I do not love you, I do not surrender my heart to
               you;  on  the  contrary,  I  love  Jesus,  I  want  to  surrender  my
               heart to Jesus » (Speech on God's love for us).
                                                                         66
                    God! The eternal, infinite being that gave existence to all
               things; the pure holiness, pure goodness, pure beauty holding
               all things without being held, seeing and knowing everything
               without  being  totally  known;  the  light,  life,  splendor,  glory,
               truth, and eternal love! If a son must lave his father because
               he is the begetter, with greater reason the people must love
               God,  who  created  them  from  nothing  and  redeemed  them
               from eternal death. Far this reason God said: « You must love

               all  your  strength,  and  with  all  your  mind  »  (Lk.  10,  27).

                    Dearest  children,  I  exhort  you  to  expand  your  heart  in
               the  most  holy  love  of  the  adorable,  most  loving  Jesus  our
               Lord. Oh! What results may youths achieve, if they do not feel
               love for Jesus (Letter, Feb. 13, 1922)?

                    Jesus  dislikes  cold  hearts,  but  likes  intimate,  tender,
               effusive, strong, calm, constant love. Please love Jesus with
               great  transport  of  will  and mind,  with  all  the  interior  powers
               and  the  feelings  of  your  soul;  be  always  fully  aware  of  his
               adorable  person  and  of  the  mysteries  of  his  most  holy  life.
               May the holy tabernacle, which is the loving nest where his
               divine body gathers the eagles, attract you (Speech, 1906).

                    If you can do a favor to Jesus, the best you can do is to
               say « I love you. » He longs for and wants love from us. Let
               us  say  it,  therefore,  over  and  over  again;  when  unable  to
               speak, we will say it by heart! So that no moment of our life
               be  without  pronouncing  such  a  saying,  we  declare  that  we
               intend to repeat « Jesus, I love you! »  at each beat of our   67
               heart.  Jesus  deserves  our  love;  why  shouldn't  we  heartly
               reciprocate his infinite love by loving him with our little love?
               We say, therefore, aver and over again with all our heart: «
               Jesus, I love you. » (3)

                    Daughters  in  Jesus  Christ,  let  us  endeavor  to  sanctify
               ourselves, because all else is vanity. The Holy Spirit said: «
               Where there is no science of the soul, there is no good. » Let
               us love Jesus, our supreme goodness, attend to him with one
               heart,  one  soul,  one  mind;  let  us  look  at  Jesus,  work  far
               Jesus,  zeal  far  the  interests  of  his  heart,  worry  for  what
               worries him, and rejoice far what pleases him. Let us have no
               thought but Jesus, because we find happiness in Jesus only.]]></page><page Index="68"><![CDATA[It  is  true  that  we  face  0pposition,  contradiction,
               straightness, and troubles, but all these things are means of
               sanctification. Daughters, be sure of this: if you were in the
               world, you would be suffering tribulation and labor much more
               serious and bitter than the ones you endure in the religious
               life,  but  without  merit.  Therefore,  let  us  be  pleased  with
               suffering  some  pain  together  with  Jesus,  our  supreme
               goodness, who suffered so much for our sake! Besides, he
               knows how to reward even in this life those who suffer for him
               (Letter, May 13, 1889).

                    Today is the feast of the most holy Heart of Jesus; I do
               not  know  whether  you  applied  and  concentrated  your
               thoughts on the importance of Jesus and his divine heart for a
               while.

                    If this precious sparkle of love for Jesus does not get a
               light in our hearts, everything is useless. The apostle said: « I
               may  have  all  the  faith  needed  to  move  mountains...  I  may
               give away everything I have, and even give up my body to be
               burned, but if I have not love, it does me no good » (1 Cor.   68
               13, 2-3).

                    We must consider what Jesus is, his love for the people,
               and  the  happiness  in  loving  him.  But,  pay  attention!  Loving
               Jesus does not mean to feel some sensible devotion or the
               pleasure of doing nothing else but staying in the Church; on
               the contrary, it means mortification, submission to obedience,
               avoiding sins, even the least ones, carrying the cross of labor,
               privation,  contradiction,  and  suffering.  Divine  love,  which
               brings consolation, is kindled in the soul this way.

                    You  see  how  very  important  your  cultivation  of  daily
               virtues  is.  The  people  striving  for  perfection  are  greatly
               rewarded even in this life because Jesus likes taking humble,
               pure,  fervent  souls  as  his  brides.  The  tepid,  negligent,
               stubborn souls are unsuitable.]]></page><page Index="69"><![CDATA[The people willing to belong totally to the Lord will help
               themselves  by  prayer  and  by  appealing  to  the  most  holy
               Virgin, because without her protection we achieve no good.
               Since  the  foundation  of  religious  life  is  the  most  perfect
               subjection,  respect,  and  confidence  toward  superiors,  I
               recommend these virtues to you.

                    I bless you all; I intend to give a particular blessing from
               the Heart of Jesus to the one who, after reading this letter,
               will make the best resolves, putting them into practice (Letter,
               June 19, 1903).


                           6. THE MOST PRECIOUS BLOOD

                    By  the  Lord's  grace,  in  our  institutes  we  have  always
               been devout to the most holy Heart of Jesus, to his most Holy
               Name, and to his most Holy Face.

                    For a long time I have been having a mind to combine
               the  three  devotions,  which  are  related  to  our  Lord  Jesus   69
               Christ, with the great devotion to the most Precious Blood, in
               whose honor we say this beautiful ejaculatory prayer: « We
               salute Man-God's immaculate blood, precious money for the
               sinners' ransom. »

                    On  purpose  I  sent  this  booklet  of  the  Most  Precious
               Blood to this house; please take note in the calendar so that
               this devotion may be practiced in July, every year. (4)

                    In these gloomy times we can present our regards and
               homages of atonement to the most Precious Blood that the
               divine  Savior  of  our  souls  shed  for  sinners  with  such  great
               suffering; we can also present this great price of our ransom
               to  the  eternal  divine  Father  for  the  salvation  of  the  holy
               Church and of the world through plenty of holy workers (Circ.,
               July 24, 1919).]]></page><page Index="70"><![CDATA[7. THE MOST HOLY NAME OF JESUS



                                                          Feb. 22, 1921

                    Since  Jan.  1888,  about  34  years  ago,  we  have  been
               attributing  a  great  importance  to  the  petition  we  present  on
               Jan. 31, a day consecrated to the feast of Jesus' holy name
               in our houses; this importance should never decrease.

                    Such an importance is based on our Lord Jesus Christ's
               divine promises, who said to his disciples, the apostles, and
               all the Christians till the end of the world: « I tell you the truth:
               the Father will give you whatever you ask of Him in my name
               » (Jn. 16, 23). On another occasion he said: « And I will do
               whatever  you  ask  for  in  my  name  »  (Jn.  14,  13).  He  also
               added:  «  Till  now  you  have  not  asked  for  anything  in  my
               name; ask and you will receive, so that your happiness may
               be complete » (Jn. 16, 24).
                                                                         70
                    Not  believing  these  divine  promises  is  not  believing  in
               Jesus Christ's divinity. Asking in the name of our Lord means
               asking through his divine merits, which can obtain everything
               from the eternal Father. By praying in the name of Jesus we
               join his earthly, perfect prayers which the eternal Father could
               not help granting; now, Jesus repeats his divine petition from
               the tabernacle, and we join them every time we pray in his
               name,  firmly  trusting  that  God  will  deny  nothing  owing  to
               Jesus' promise. If we have to pray so in any time, with greater
               reason we have to do so an the day dedicated to his mast
               Holy Name.

                    The feast in honor of the Holy Name falls twice: on New
               Year's Day, Circumcision of the Lard, when he was given the
               sweetest name Jesus, and in the first days]]></page><page Index="71"><![CDATA[of January when the liturgy specifically celebrates the Name
               of Jesus. Owing to this, January is usually dedicated to the
               most holy name, which is above all names, in which we find
               safety, before which heaven, earth, and hell kneel.

                    This  beautiful,  beneficial  devotion  is  among  the  main
               ones in our institute. During the mass we read from a booklet
               on  the  most  holy  name  of  Jesus,  say  its  litany,  and  sing  a
               song  of  the  most  holy  name  after  the  benediction.  The
               solemn  novena  to  the  holy  name  begins on  Jan.  22  before
               the Blessed Sacrament solemnly exposed, and the novena is
               preached wherever it is possible.

                    We celebrate the feast on Jan. 31 saying two masses of
               the most holy name, one low, the other high by permission of
               the  Holy  See.  A  most  special  petition  is  presented  to  the
               eternal Father on that day following the custom we began 34
               years ago. The petition along with 34 requests concerning the
               best  spiritual  goods  is  conveniently  prepared  in  January;
               through  this  petition  we  implore  from  the  eternal  Father
               spiritual  good for  ourselves  and  our houses  in  the  name of   71
               Jesus; we also implore the temporal goods that are related to
               the sanctification and improvement of our communities.

                    The  petitions  we  have  already  made,  especially  the
               printed  ones,  show  how  the  new  petitions  are  going  to  be
               formed. To comply with the precept of the Apostle Paul: « In
               all  prayers  ask  God  for  what  you  need,  always  asking  him
               with  a  thankful  heart  »  (Ph.  4,  6),  each  request  will  be
               preceded  by  a  tender  thanksgiving  for  the  graces  we  have
               already obtained. Every year we add or take away something
               from the previous petitions, according to the circumstances;
               by so doing we diversify them; sometimes, however, we had
               no need to make changes.]]></page><page Index="72"><![CDATA[The Daughters of Divine Zeal must know that this great
               devotion to the most holy, adorable name of Jesus must be in
               force and fervor in our institute forever, dedicating January to
               his  name,  celebrating  the  feast  on  Jan.  31,  and  presenting
               the  petition  along  with  the  34  requests  to  the  Father  in  the
               name of Jesus.


                         8. HOW TO PRESENT THE PETITION

                    The  private  petition  we  present  in  our  semi-public
               oratories  or  in  our  houses  or  in  our  churches  may  use
               different para-liturgies.

                    In  the  oratories,  after  the  mass  we  expose  the  Holy
               Sacrament for the adoration we do until midday. At noon, the
               communities gather in the oratory at the foot of Jesus, and a
               priest of ours reads the petition. AM follow the reading with
               their  mind  and  heart,  saying  with  contrition «  Gloria  Patri  »
               after each request. At the end, the priest places the petition
               behind  the  altar-card  and  ends  the  para-liturgy  with  the   72
               blessing of the Holy Sacrament. « Te Deum » may precede
               the benediction..

                    In  default  of  our  priests,  we  invite  another  one  for  the
               benediction. Should be this the case, the mother superior or
               an older sister will read the petition.

                    Presenting the petition to the eternal divine Father in the
               most holy name of Jesus contemporaneously in our houses is
               beautiful,  pleasant,  and  of  greater  effectiveness.  If  the
               community  has  only  a  public  church,  the  petition  will  follow
               this pattern:

                    Before noon the community gathers in the closed church
               to present the petition. If a priest happens to be available he
               will open the tabernacle shortly before the reading. If no priest
               is available, the tabernacle will remain closed, but the lights
               will be on.]]></page><page Index="73"><![CDATA[If the church is open to the faithful, the priest will prepare
               the people in order to present a public petition, which may be
               one of those we have published in the booklets of the most
               Holy Name of Jesus, but he may adapt it to circumstances of
               time and place (S.D.D.Z.).

                    The following day we begin offering 34 masses to have
               the requests granted; the offering of these masses is private
               (Circ. Jan. 25, 1920).


                               9. MARY! THE MOTHER!

                    Here is the stormy sea's mystic star of our life: Mary!

                    The  infinite  wisdom  of  God  met  the  inner  needs  of
               human nature by giving us the most holy Mary as mother!

                    The name mother is sweet, dear to the sensitive heart.
               Everyone feels a tender affection for his mother, because she
               conceived him, carried him, begot him in labor pains, hugged   73
               him  in  her  motherly  arms,  warmed  him  with  kisses,  raised
               him,  and  raised  him  with  the  irresistible,  effusive  love  of
               motherhood.

                    Besides giving us such a natural mother, God also gave
               us  a  more  tender,  laving  mother  in  the  supernatural  order.
               This mother is the ideal of any beauty, grace, holiness, and
               love!  By  gathering  in  her  the  highest  degree  of  beauty  and
               goodness, God made her creation's masterpiece.

                    The  Evangelist  St.  Luke  (1.  46-55)  reports  the  Magni-
               ficat, the inspired hymn Mary spoke extempore to exalt God
               for the gifts and privileges He had endowed her with: « My
               heart is glad because of God... because of the great things
               the Mighty has done for me. »

                    The  most  holy  Mary's  highest  claim  of  glory  and
               greatness resides in the divine Word's incarnation in her]]></page><page Index="74"><![CDATA[purest  womb  by the  work of  the  Holy  Spirit.  She  conceived
               Jesus  Christ,  God  and  man,  in  her  immaculate  womb,  and
               begot  the  divine  child  in  a  grotto  at  Bethlehem  without
               lessening her virginity, but remaining always a Virgin. A virgin
               mother!  Virginity  and  maternity  combined  together!  What  a
               supernatural beauty!

                    Virgin-Mother of God! Such a maternity's sublime glory
               exalts  Mary  above  the  angels,  giving her a throne  near  the
               most holy Trinity. Furthermore, by becoming mother of Jesus
               Christ Mary also became our mother, mother of humankind.

                    Please  check  the  holy  gospel.  Because  of  his  human
               nature  descending  from  Adam,  Jesus  Christ  called  himself
               our brother; we are, therefore, children of the most holy Mary
               through  Jesus.  The  evangelist  John  reports  the  touching
               event of Jesus that, being at the point of death and making
               signs with his head to his mother in sorrow at the foot of the
               cross, pointed to John and said, « Woman, here is your son »
               (Jn.  19,  2G).  The  sacred  writers  explain  that  our  Lord
               bequeathed humankind and all the people as children to the   74
               most holy Mary in the disciple John.

                    What  an  inexpressible  testament  of  love!  Showing  the
               mother Jesus also said to John, « Here is your mother » (Jn.
               19, 26). What a loving, lucky filiation is this one! While Mary is
               bound  to  take  care  of  us  as  her  children,  we  are  bound  to
               love and respect her  as our mother! We are unable to fully
               understand how much the most holy Mary loves each of us.
               Standing before God she prays and obtains so many graces
               for us!

                    My  dearest  lord,  if  you  happened  to  be  saved  from  a
               danger or if you recovered from illness or  succeeded in any
               enterprise  or  received  benefits,  all  this  depended  on  our
               celestial mother's love, even though you did not]]></page><page Index="75"><![CDATA[appeal to her! Probably you happened to suffer because of
               God's plan. That suffering made you wish to lead a better life,
               owing to human events; however it may be, suffering cannot
               be avoided on earth; and yet, the cure of illness as well as
               patience  and  submission  to  suffering,  are  due  to  the  mast
               holy Mary's intercession (Letter to the Friends).

                    My  dearest  lord,  do  you  want any  flavor  from  heaven?
               Do you want to be sure of your eternal salvation? Love and
               entreat the most holy Mary. She is the Star of the Sea of our
               life. The Church greets her « Star of the Sea. » She is the
               rising dawn, the Morning Star, the Ark of salvation!

                    The Church's Fathers and Doctors affirm that devotion to
               the mast holy Mary or even a sparkle of love toward this great
               mother  or  a  tender  look  far  her  sorrows  at  the  foot  of  the
               cross is a sign of predestination.

                    My lord, do you know what Mary begins to do when you
               endeavor to lave her, to invoke her, and to pray to her? She
               draws  you  up  to  God,  letting  lave  for  Jesus  spring  in  your   75
               heart for your salvation; she enlightens your mind about the
               mysteries of faith, infuses humility and docility, lets you know
               and  long  far  divine  grace  and  far  God's  friendship.  There
               arises  in  you  a  sweet  impulse  to  practice  our  holy  Catholic
               religion;  in  short,  she  gently  leads  you  to  eternal  salvation
               (Ibidem).

                    It is a general opinion of the sacred writers, the Fathers,
               the Doctors of the Church, and of Catholic doctrine that love
               and  devotion  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  is  a  great  sign  of
               predestination to eternal life.

                    The reason is that the most holy Virgin has been elected
               by God to be our mother and mediatrix before His throne. Oh!
               If  we  fully  understood  the  most  holy  Virgin's  motherly  love
               toward each soul; how she longs]]></page><page Index="76"><![CDATA[for  the  salvation  of  all;  haw  she  prays  before  God  for  the
               eternal salvation of each of us!

                    Her  motherly  love  notwithstanding,  our  cooperation  is
               necessary for we have to believe, love, hope, avoid sin, and
               observe  divine  law.  My  dearest  lord,  I  exhort  you  to  love
               intensely  this  great,  purest,  beautiful,  immaculate  mother.
               She is the reflection of God's splendor, the purest mirror of
               divine  perfections,  the  powerful  mediatrix,  the  benign,
               merciful  lady,  the  queen  of  heaven  and  earth.  God extolled
               her above the saints and the angels in the celestial glory for
               she  is  related  to  the  most  holy  Trinity,  is  the  first-born
               daughter of God the Father, the always virgin mother of God
               the Son, the immaculate bride of God the Holy Spirit.

                    Please  put  your  eternal  salvation  in  the  hands  of  this
               great mother (Ibidem).



                          10. ALL GRACES THROUGH MARY                    76

                    « Out of the fullness of his grace he has blessed us all »
               (Jn. 1, 16). When St. Bernard the doctor ascribed this saying
               to  the  most  holy  Mary  he  did  not  limit  her  beneficent,
               universal  action  to  the  sphere  of  our  earthly  life.  The  most
               holy  Mary's  beneficent  action  transcends  the  boundaries  of
               this  world,  reaching  the  happy  souls  of  heaven  as  well  as
               those  who  are  in  purgatory,  making  the  triumphant,  the
               militant, and the purifying Church enjoy streams of her grace
               and glory: « of her fullness we all have received » (Jn. 1, 16).

                    Besides  perceiving  that  their  salvation  depended  an
               Mary,  the  blessed  of  heaven  feel  themselves  overpaid
               because  they  see  and  share  in  the  celestial  beauties,  the
               sublime dignity, the virtues, and the incomparable glory of the
               great Queen of Angels and Saints. Their predestination]]></page><page Index="77"><![CDATA[to glory is bound to the eternal predestination of God's first-
               born daughter; they, therefore, enjoy God through Mary. As to
               the militant Church, who can explain how all the people have
               received  and  are  receiving  from  her  fullness?  Always  and
               everywhere the most holy Mary's beneficent, celestial action
               represents  the  continuous,  unfolding  fecundity  coming  from
               Jesus' merits. From aver 20 centuries the most holy Mary's
               beneficent action wonderfully displays her favor an the souls
               in  purgatory:  she  enters  into  the  dark  prison  and  the
               tremendous  fire  to  relieve  and  set  free  those  afflicted
               prisoners. The sacred writers, many Fathers and Doctors of
               the  Church  as  well  as  many  revelations  to  the  saints  show
               identical opinions on this matter (Speech, Dec. 1, 1918).



                          11. THE SACRED HEART OF MARY

                    I  would  like  to  submit  two  reasons  that  show  why  the
               Heart of Mary is the most perfect.
                                                                         77
                    1. The Heart of Mary is immaculate.

                    Adam's  corrupt  blood  carrying  the  germs  of  the  pas-
               sions,  as  well  as  any  passion  coming  from  Adam's  blood
               never  took  effect  in  the  purest  Heart  of  Mary:  no  feeling  of
               anger,  no  throb  of  grudge,  no  move  of  wrath,  no  envy,  not
               any passion ever defiled the finest delicate fiber of that Heart
               that  came  out  of  God's  hands  so  pure  and beautiful.  Since
               the  Word's  most  hilly  human  body  was  going  to  be  farmed
               through Mary's blood, only immaculate blood ran through her
               Heart. Likewise since the Heart of Mary was immaculate, free
               from  any  breath  of  passion,  pure,  candid,  innocent,  it  was
               also tender, noble, sensitive, and generous beyond all hearts.]]></page><page Index="78"><![CDATA[2.  The  Heart of  Mary  was  full  of  all  graces and  burning
               with the flames of divine lave.

                    Human mind can hardly reach the full understanding of
               the  abundance  of  grace  that  God  put  in  the  Heart  of  Mary
               when He created it: how many lovely touches, gentle charms
               God  exerted  on  that  Heart,  how  many  tender  plays,  how
               many  games  God  worked  in  the  Heart  of  Mary.  It  is  not
               possible to fully understand the flames of divine love burning
               in her sacred heart, nor can we comprehend the meaning of
               that  burning,  at  whose  comparison  the  angels'  love  is  a
               sparkle.  It  is  well  known  that  when  grace  makes  nature
               perfect,  it  regenerates  it.  Under  the  work  of  grace  the
               roughest  souls  and  the  most  indelicate  natures  became
               tender and sensitive; once entered into the heart (rough and
               insensible as it may be), the fire of divine love purifies from
               any  earthly  affection,  elevates,  deifies,  and  transforms  the
               heart into a new one. What grace and divine love operated in
               the Immaculate Heart of Mary so filled as it was with God's
               love? To what degree did they make perfect the nature that
               God created perfect and endowed with the finest qualities?   78

                    The bride of the Songs says: « My Beloved has spoken
               unto me and my soul has melted with love. » The Beloved not
               only  made  the  Heart  of  Mary  hear  his  voice,  but  he  also
               entered it to gather lilies. « My Beloved, » says Mary, « went
               dawn  to  his  garden...  to  gather  lilies  »  (Songs  6,  1-2).  The
               garden  of  the  Beloved  is  the  Heart  of  Mary,  where  Jesus
               entered for  the  incarnation,  where  he rested  with  his  divine
               complacency pasturing spices and lilies, which represent the
               virtues, especially holy purity.

                    Created pure and immaculate, full of grace, and burning
               with  divine  love,  the  Heart  of  Mary  was  chosen  far  the
               dwelling of the eternal king; God could not help creating]]></page><page Index="79"><![CDATA[it  as  the  best,  the  most  sensible,  tender,  generous,  noble,
               perfect among all hearts (Speech, without date).

                    The novices will foster devotion... toward the most holy
               Virgin Mary holding her as their mother; they will honor her
               Immaculate Heart along with the Heart of Jesus, and will pray
               to her for the conversion of sinners (5) (R.L.P.).



                         12. TWO HEARTS FORM ONE HEART

                    Yes, two hearts form one heart: the heart of God and the
               heart  of  a  creature,  that  is,  the  Heart  of  God-Man  and  the
               Heart of Immaculate Mary form one heart. We wonder how
               this divine unification appeared in the Son of God's actions on
               earth! If the Heart of Jesus pulsated with a perfect adoration
               of God from the time that it was formed, it did so not alone,
               but together with the Immaculate Heart of Mary. If the most
               holy  Heart  of  Jesus  made  a  continuous  offering  of  itself  to
               God  during  the  nine  months  he  was  developing  in  Mary's   79
               immaculate womb, it did so not alone, but together with the
               Immaculate Heart of Mary. The most holy Heart of Jesus did
               not wail alone while lying on the straw of Bethlehem’s grotto,
               because  the  mystical  dove  Mary  was  wailing  together  with
               him  in  her  heart.  Not  only  the  Heart  of  Jesus  attracted  the
               simple-minded  shepherds  and  the  three  lucky  kings  of  the
               East  to  the  grotto,  but  also  the  Immaculate  Heart  of  Mary
               exerted  that  attraction.  When  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  was  in
               the  carpenter's  shop  or  praying  in  the  mountains  during his
               private life of about 30 years, the Heart of Immaculate Mary
               was  spiritually  joined  together  with  the  Heart  of  Jesus,
               working, praying, and sighing with him. When the time of his
               manifestation in Jerusalem came to pass, the most adorable
               Heart of]]></page><page Index="80"><![CDATA[Jesus  worked  the  wonders  of  his  mercy  teaching  far  three
               years;  in  al  these  manifestations  the  Heart  of  Mary  was
               associated  to  his  intentions.  We  cannot  imagine  Jesus  and
               Mary's way of living as simply natural; when one of them was
               far  from  the  other,  both  of  them  were  sharing  their  life  by
               communicating their thoughts. A proof  of this strict union of
               hearts is found in the miracle at the wedding in Cana; but it is
               in the mysteries of the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ that
               we find the Hearts of Jesus and Mary in perfect union of love
               (Speech, July 29, 1890).



                             13. THE MOST HOLY MARY:
                          MASTERPIECE OF THE C'REATIO'N

                    All creatures somehow carry the image of God Creator,
               enjoying the manifestation of his infinite love..., but the most
               holy Virgin Mary among all creatures enjoys the divine love
               beyond  all  description  because  God  created  her  more
               beautiful,  more  lovable,  and  richer  with  gifts  and  privileges   80
               than all creatures joined together.

                    The  most  holy  Mary's  creation  surpasses  that  of  all
               beings  because  when  God  created  the  universe  along  with
               the reasonable beings, He was keeping in mind the most holy
               Virgin as His masterpiece. For this reason the Church applies
               the words of Wisdom to the most holy Mary, in the reading:

                      Yahweh created me when his purpose first unfolded,
                             before the oldest of his works.
                            From everlasting I was firmly set,
                     from the beginning, before earth came into being.
                           The deep was not, when I was born,
                         there were no springs to gush with water.]]></page><page Index="81"><![CDATA[Before the mountains were settled,
                               before the hills, I came to birth;
                     before he made the earth, the countryside, or the first
                                  grains of the world's dust.
                         When ;he fixed the heavens firm, I was there,
                        when he drew a ring an the surface of the deep,
                             when he thickened the clouds above,
                          when he fixed fast the springs of the deep,
                           when he assigned the sea its boundaries
                           - and the waters will not invade the shore –
                        when he laid down the foundations of the earth,
                            I was by his side, a master craftsman...
                             For the. man who finds .me finds fife,
                                he will win favor from Yahweh.
                                    (Prov. 8, 22-30, 35).

                   The holy Church puts these scriptural sublime ex-
               pressions in the most holy Virgin's mouth, and we draw from
               it that she is the masterpiece of creation. When God created
               heaven and earth He was keeping in mind the most holy
               Mary, who was going to gather in herself the beauties of   81
               nature, grace, and glory.

                   The beauties of nature are wonderfully contained in
               Mary. Beautiful is the sun shooting forward streams of light on
               earth; but mare beautiful is Mary dressed with the Sun of
               eternal light, as St. John saw her in the Revelation: « a
               woman, whose dress was the sun » (Rev. 12, 1). Beautiful is
               the moon brightening with silver light in the dark nights; but
               the moon is the most holy Mary's footrest, « who had the
               moon under her feet » (Ibidem). Beautiful are the stars
               twinkling in the immense dome of the firmament; but the stars
               are the crown for the virginal head of Mary: and « a crown of
               12 stars on her head » (Ibidem). Beautiful are the spring
               flowers, more beautifully clothed than Solomon; but the Virgin
               Mary is Jericho's mystical]]></page><page Index="82"><![CDATA[rose  surpassing  all  roses  with  the  gentle  fragrance  of  her
               divine virtues. She is the most holy Trinity's mystical white lily
               which  appeared  before  the  eyes  of  God  purer  than  the
               angels. The beauty we see in the universe is a faint reflection
               compared  with  the  beauty,  majesty,  and  decorum  of
               Immaculate Mary!

                    All .the beauty of nature is contained in Mary, that is the
               least of her attributes, for she enshrines the marvels of grace,
               surpassing  in  holiness  all  saints  and  angels  together. Many
               sacred writers are so assured of this truth that St. Alphonsus
               coils it « common and certain knowledge. » For that reason
               St. Bonaventure explains the words of Eccl. (24, 16): « I have
               taken  root  in  a  privileged  people  »,  this  way:  Mary  has  the
               fullness of holiness, the saints partake of.

                    Based  on  this  certain  doctrine  St.  AIphonsus  says  that
               Mary  was  probably  endowed  with  such  a  holiness  from  the
               time  of  her  Immaculate  Conception,  because  she  was
               destined  to  be  Mother  of  God;  to  substantiate  this  idea  he
               quotes St. Vincent Ferreri: « The Virgin was sanctified in her   82
               mother's  womb  beyond  the  saints  and  the  angels.  »  The
               prophet David said that the foundation of God's mystical city,
               that is Mary, should be laid on the holy mountain top: « His
               city  founded  on  the  holy  mountain  »  (Ps.  87,  1).  St.
               Alphonsus explains: « The beginning of the most holy Mary's
               life should be higher than that of all the saints. » The prophet
               Isaiah expressed the same idea when he said that the house
               of Gad should be founded on the highest mountain top. St.
               Gregory explains: « The summit of the mountains is Mary's
               lofty  position,  shining  over  all  the  saints.  »  .  What  next?
               Talking  with  Mary  God  said,  «  many  women  have  done
               admirable things, but you surpass them all » (Prov. 31, 29).
               Please note that all refers to the elects together, not one by
               one.]]></page><page Index="83"><![CDATA[If the most holy Mary has surpassed all creatures in the
               gifts of nature and grace, it follows that she surpassed them
               all in the glory in such a degree that she is more glorious in
               heaven  than  the  angels  and  the  saints  all  together;  I  would
               say  that  the  angels  and  saints'  beatitude  does  not  reach  a
               millionth of that of the most holy Mary. We state the reason
               for that: the most holy Mary's relationship with the most holy
               Trinity is so intimate that she shares in the infinite glory. She
               is the Father's firstborn daughter, and he gladdens her with
               his eternal happiness; the San has her as his most beloved
               mother,  and  in  his  infinite  wisdom  he  shares  with  her  the
               inconceivable joy that he enjoys in his Father; the Holy Spirit
               has taken her as his mast privileged bride, and bestows on
               her  the  everlasting  fire  of  sanctifying  love  which  forms  his
               beatitude in the procession from the Father and the Son. The
               most  hidden,  elating  mysteries  of  highest  glory  are  fully
               communicated to the sublime Lady of heaven and earth; to
               make a comparison, we state that the angels and the saints
               are  like  a  drink  from  a  creek  of  glory,  while  Mary,  eternal
               beatitude,  fills  and  gives  joy  to  God's  mystical  city,  like  an
               impetuous river: There is a river whose streams refresh the   83
               city of God (Ps. 46, 4). (Speech, 1899).


                          14. OUR LOVE FOR THE MADONNA

                    The  flame  of  love,  forming  the  saints,  is  their  tender,
               profound, gentle love for the great Mother of God, the most
               holy Mary! Such a love is in full accord with the love of God
               who  gives  all  graces  through  Immaculate  Mary,  making  her
               the love of all the predestined (Speech, May 17, 1915).

                    This  little  community's  rule  proposes  devotion  to  the
               most holy Virgin as an effective means to reach sanctification]]></page><page Index="84"><![CDATA[and any good success. May love for the great Mother of God
               and  devotion  to  her  form  a  chief  point  of  this  little  order's
               spirit!  Probationers,  when  the  love  for  the  most  holy  Mary
               enters our hearts, love of Jesus will reign among us (There).

                    What about a .probationer whose love of the most holy
               Virgin  is  indifferent?  Not  only  will  he  not  persevere  in  his
               vocation, but he will also run the risk of going off course.

                    This  little  community  will  honor  the  most  holy  Mary  as
               Lady, mother, and protectress, paying attention to celebrating
               her  novenas  and  feasts,  especially  the  Immaculate
               Conception,  the  Nativity,  Our  Lady  of  Sorrows,  and  her
               maternity, patronage, and Assumption. As to those of us who
               are citizens of Messina, the feast of the Sacred Letter will be
               at heart (P.R.P.).

                    The Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus will glory in the
               greatest devotion and transport of love for the great Mother of
               God, the most holy Mary, who is the patroness of the order.
               As much as they can, the congregants will endeavor to make   84
               the  people  came  to  know  and  to  love  the  Virgin  Mary,
               propagating  her  devotion  and  celebrating  her  novenas  and
               feasts with greatest fervor (C.R.).

                    We  must  bear  in mind  that  the  eternal Father  gave us
               our Lord Jesus through the most holy Virgin Mary; that Jesus
               gave  himself  up  to  us  through  Mary,  and  the  Holy  Spirit
               brought about the Incarnation of the Ward by agreement with
               Mary.

                    Referring  to  what  was  said  neither  patriarchs  nor
               prophets  nor  upright  men  obtained  the  Redeemer  in  40
               centuries, but the most holy Mary obtained him in 15 years.
               She was endowed with full understanding, wisdom, and the
               most  elect  virtues  since  her  Immaculate  Conception.  She
               knew the situation of mankind, in need of]]></page><page Index="85"><![CDATA[the  Redeemer,  ardently  petitioning  God  to  send  forth  the
               Messiah. From the time of her nativity until the Annunciation,
               she  increased  her  longing  and  ardent  petitions  for  the
               Messiah  to  came,  unaware  that  she  herself,  should  be  his
               mother.

                    Now, then, if the most holy Trinity gave us Jesus through
               the  most  holy  Mary,  should  we  not  obtain  graces  through
               her?

                    Sanctification means acquiring the virtues that our Lord
               Jesus  Christ  taught  us,  since  these  virtues  increase
               sanctifying grace, and make us holy. St. Paul stated: « This is
               God's  will  for  you:  he  wants  you  to  be  holy  »  (Thes.  4,  3).
               Earlier our Lord had said: « You must be perfect just as your
               Father  in  heaven  is  perfect.  »  Let  us  endeavor  to  sanctify
               ourselves,  gaining  great  treasures  of  grace,  which  lead  to
               eternal glory.

                    Mary  is  standing  before  the  divine  treasure  of  grace.
               Whoever  loves,  trusts,  invokes,  and  honors  Mary  will  grow   85
               rich with abundant graces by God's will, but whoever stands
               aloof has no hope, because the other exercises of devotion
               will fail, and perseverance will totter.

                    St.  Ignatius  of  Loyola  once  visited  a  college;  to  guess
               the youths' future he asked them about their devotion to the
               most holy Virgin Mary and from their answers the Saint found
               the fervid and the indifferent. Later, talking with the rector in
               secret he said: « The fervid will succeed, the indifferent will
               not: » History confirmed his word.

                    Dearest children, I know that you love the V4rgin Mary,
               and I delight in it; still I exhort you to love her always more.
               St. Bonaventure called the Virgin Mary « entire reason of my
               hope.» In the « Hail, holy Queen », we too call her: « Life,
               sweetness, and our hope! »

                    May  devotion  to  the  Virgin  Mary  be  a  characteristic  of
               the Rogationists, drawing upon them a special love]]></page><page Index="86"><![CDATA[from the Mother of God. When Jesus reigns among the youth
               of a religious institute Mary loves them, but she loves more a
               community of dear children who besides devoting themselves
               to charitable institutions also promote the divine command of
               our Lord Jesus Christ: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the
               harvest that he will send out workers to gather in his harvest.
               » Of course, Our Lady takes delight in it because she knows
               how  this  prayer  fosters  the  greatest  glory  of  God  and  the
               good  of  souls;  therefore,  she  looks  with  particular  favor  an
               this community which is the only one having such a mission
               in the Church.

                    The  little  seed,  however,  needs  to  grow  rich  with  holy
               virtues, especially with elating love for Jesus!

                    It has been many years since the hellish enemy is trying
               to destroy the best part of this pious institute of the interests
               of Jesus' Heart. How many times the institute has suffocated!
               But  now  the  little  plant  of  the  ROGATE,  which  is  more
               pregnant  far  the  Rogationists  than  the  Daughters  of  Divine
               Zeal,  displays  its  little  branches,  grows  greener  every  year,   86
               and stretches its roots underneath the soil. But which is the
               fecund  soil,  where  the  mats  of  the  tree  stretch  and
               strengthen, making the tree rise?

                    My  children,  the  fecund  soil  is  holy  humility,  and  the
               perfect  model,  as  well  as  divine  teacher,  is  the  most  holy
               Virgin Mary... (Letter, April 1, 1922).


                       15. THE MOST HOLY NAME OF MARY (6)

                                                  Messina, Dec. 7, 1907

                    1. I have received your request far bearing the most holy
               name of Mary, august Mother of God, before the name you
               providentially received in the taking of the]]></page><page Index="87"><![CDATA[garb. We are delighted in your pious wish, because we have
               nothing so much at heart as to put our dearest daughters in

               as well as to see them adorned and protected by such a dear

                                                  Messina, April 7, 1922

                    3. With great  pleasure I meet your request by granting
               the  favor  of  bearing  the  most  holy,  sweet  name  of  MARY
               before the religious name you have been given in the taking
               of the garb.

                    Dearest daughters, I exhort you to answer this grace as
               though you were receiving it from the most holy Virgin Mary.
               Please  strive  to  make  yourselves  worthy  of  bearing  it  by
               imitating perfectly the most holy Mother's virtues.

                    Dearest daughters, please notice that this celestial name
               is granted to you today, April 7, when we are celebrating the   88
               feast of Our Lady in sorrow in the Passion week. It reminds
               you of Mary's faithfulness and love and of the disciple John,
               standing  on  Calvary  at  the  foot  of  the  cross  near  the  great
               Mother in sorrow while the apostles were absent.

               Virgin invite you to meditate every day on their suffering with
               great love and compassion. Only by so doing will you grow in
               divine  grace,  receive  Holy  Communion  devoutly,  observe
               your rules faithfully, practice the religious virtues, and become
               holy.]]></page><page Index="89"><![CDATA[NOTES

                   1  From our padre's spiritual notes that are called « My Lord Jesus
               Christ's Imitation >> we deduce how much he strove to imitate our Lord:

                                                      Trani, Sept. 10, 1910

                           MY LORD JESUS CHRIST'S IMITATION

                   My  Lord  Jesus  prayed  incessantly  with  recollection  during  his

                   My Lord Jesus Christ laved, forgave, excused, and prayed for his
               enemies, returning good for evil, immolating himself, and rescuing many
               of them!
                   My Lord Jesus Christ was meek and humble in heart.
                   My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  was  subject and  obedient  to the most holy
               Mary and St. Joseph.
                   My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  loved  and  honored  his  holy  Mother  very
               much.
                   My Lard Jesus Christ not only loved suffering and dying for me, but
               he suffered and died for me!
                   My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  longed  and  sought  untiringly  his  Father's
               glory, the highest sanctification of souls, and their salvation.   89
                   My Lord Jesus Christ not only did not excuse himself when he was
               strongly charged, but he kept silent.
                   My Lord Jesus Christ loved the poor and consoled the afflicted.
                   My Lord Jesus Christ loved and exalted children very much.
                   My Lord Jesus gave himself for us.
                   My  Lord  Jesus  was  most  frugal  to  drinking  and  eating,  enduring
               hunger and thirst.
                   My Lord Jesus spent the nights in prayer.
                   My Lord Jesus wailed and prayed for the apostles' vocations and for
               the saints of all times.
                   My Jesus Christ was just with everyone.
                   My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  taught  the  truth  without  regard  for  human
               respect.
                   My  Lord  Jesus  Christ  was  always  composed  and  modest  even
               during his incredible suffering.
                   My Jesus Christ kept even Judas' reputation jealously.
                   My Jesus Christ always humbled himself before his Father; he also
               humbled himself before the apostles by washing their feet.
                   My Jesus Christ spent no moment without suffering, praying, and
               working.
                   My Jesus Christ was poor, always loving, and practicing poverty.
                   My Jesus Christ was always gentle, tender, and attractive.]]></page><page Index="90"><![CDATA[My Jesus Christ said only holy and perfect words.
                   My Jesus Christ alternated active with contemplative life.
                   My Jesus Christ observed the whale law, even the civil one, paying
               the taxes to Caesar.
                   My Jesus Christ avoided honors and faced contempt.
                   My Jesus Christ was strong, fearless, and constant in suffering.
                   My Jesus Christ loved and longed far the crass alb life long; he was
               crucified and was immolated on it for my sake.
                   My Jesus Christ was available to everyone; he gave himself up for
               me and far all people by his life, death, and resurrection; and in the most
               Holy Sacrament.
                   My Jesus Christ  did  not  reveal his innermost to  the  Jews,  but  he
               answered their questions properly.
                   My Jesus Christ concealed' his infinite suffering under silence.
                   My Jesus Christ faced contempt with meekness.
                   My Jesus Christ prayed to his eternal Father, bending deeply on his
               knees.
                     My Jesus Christ endured and endures the elects' and the sinners'
               unfaithfulness and their misery with unlimited patience.

                   2  To foster holy emulation among the Religious our padre devised
               the virtue contest. A poster announced the comfiest with one of these
               notices: Holy humility contest - Obedience contest - Meekness contest -
               Gently speaking contest - and so on. The congregants had to emulate   90
               each other in a specific virtue for a period of time following the poster's
               indications; Later the mother superior reported the results to our padre,
               who used to make the proper remarks to the Religious.

                   3  Let us make a copy of this beautiful love prayer: Jesus, I love you!
               I love you, because I long to love you; I love you to satisfy your Heart's
               desires; I love you to atone for the sins of the whole world; I love you to
               atone for the sins I dared to commit; I love you and beg your love far my
               poor heart; I love you and beg your love for all hearts; I love you for all
               the hearts that do not know you; I love you for all the hearts that are
               unwilling to love you; I love you for the coldest hearts; I love you in union
               with the most fervent hearts; I love you for the pitiable sinners; I love you
               with all the just on earth; I love and long for you together with the holy
               souls that are in purgatory; I love you with all the dwellers of heaven; I
               love you with Immaculate Mary always virgin; I love you because I have
               firmly decided to do so until my last breath; I love you because I desire
               to love you and enjoy you in paradise for ever and ever. Amen!

                   4   These  sound  devotions  are  being  always  recommended  by  the
               holy Church; for instance, His Holiness John XXIII talking of devotions
               said: « His first year's experience in the pastoral care has given the new
               bishop of Rome, the universal shepherd of the Church, the feeling that
               same devout, pious souls desire to start new devotions, new]]></page><page Index="91"><![CDATA[titles,  and  worship under inspiration  of local custom,  which  give much
               opportunity to imagination, but little chance for the spirit's concentration.
               We like inviting you to be familiar with simpler and older devotions... To
               enlighten and foster the adoration to Jesus nothing is more suitable than
               meditating and invoking him in the triple light of his Name, his Heart, and
               his Blood... Touching upon various topics, we have come to the Calvary
               where  the name  of  Jesus is  written over the  Cruclfled's  head in three
               languages.  Jesus'  Heart  is  palpitating  in  his  chest,  longing  for  the
               supreme sacrifice: Jesus' blood is bursting out of the opened wound, as
               out of a source unexhausted and inexhaustible for life and for universal
               redemption. At the foot of the cross we find two witnesses: the mother of
               Jesus and his beloved disciple  » (Papal pronouncement at the end of
               the Diocese's Synod, Jan. 31, 1960).
               (5)    As  a  matter  of  fact,  our  padre  erected  The  Confraternity  of
               Immaculate  Mary's    Heart  in  Avignone's  chapel  and  joined    it  to  the
               primary one  in  Paris, and  he  ordered  that a  prayer  to  Immaculate
               Mary's Heart be said every Saturday, for the conversion of sinners.
               (6)   Our padre wanted the sisters professed  in  perpetual vows to join
               the  name  Mary  to  their  religious  name,  but  he  granted  it  only  after
               regular,  repeated  requests,  to  foster  their  desire;  he  also  worded  a
               decree  of  special  privilege  which  stated  that  it  was  granted  by  the
               founder. The sisters were tofd to keep the concession as a great gift and
               to  imitate the  most holy   Mary's virtues.»  (VITALE:   « Fr.   Mary
               Hannibal Di Francia » etc., page 287). The Padre modified the decree   91
               according to circumstances as it appears from the above concessions. -]]></page><page Index="92"><![CDATA[92]]></page><page Index="93"><![CDATA[CHAPTER IV

                                VARIOUS DEVOTIONS


                    I  will  endeavor  to  be  interiorly  pious  and  devout,
               avoiding to appear so only exteriorly.
                    Celebrating  the  feast and novenas  of our  Lord,  the
               most  holy  Virgin,  and  the  saints,  as  we  do  in  our
               Institutes, I will be recollected.
                    I  will  be  affectionate  and  devout  to  the  angels  and
               the  saints,  especially  to  the  Patriarch  St.  Joseph,  St.
               John  the  Baptist,  St.  Michael  the  archangel,  the  holy
               guardian angels, St. Anne, St. Joachim, the apostles, the
               martyrs,  the  patron  saints,  the  Celestial  Rogationists,
               and  the  saints  our  Institutes  honor,  especially  St.
               Anthony of  Padua.
                    To  my  great  pleasure  I  have  learned  that  this
               Institute nurtures a particular compassion and devotion
               toward the souls who are in purgatory; I will foster such
               devotion by often praying for them.                       93
                    I  have  also  become  aware  of  this  Institute's  pious
               and beneficial customs to join pious unions of our Lord,
               the  most  holy  Virgin,  the  angels,  and  to  affiliate  with
               various  religious  orders  to  win  celestial  protection  and
               spiritual benefits. While appreciating this divine mercy by
               giving thanks to the Lord and to the superiors' charity, I
               will join the most holy Virgin's slavery of love according
               to the spirit of St. Louis M. Grignion.




                                       1. PIETY

                    What  is  an  aspirant  worth  if  he  has  no  piety?  He  is  a
               useless, unfruitful tree-trunk.
                    Without piety the aspirant is unable to develop religious]]></page><page Index="94"><![CDATA[status, and is unable to become a good Christian. It is a pity
               to see youths who are cold and indifferent in the practices of
               religion, who have no disposition to devotion toward God and
               the saints, and who have no particular love for the most holy
               Virgin. These aspirants leave no hope for success.

                    Young aspirants, if you feel cold and indifferent to piety,
               please practice the religious observances, asking the Lord for
               grace, enlightenment, and fervor. (R.A.).

                    Remember  that  an  apostle  said:  «  Spiritual exercise  is
               valuable in every way » (1 Tim. 4, 8). Piety not only includes
               the strict union of hearts in the common devotion to God, but
               also the practices that foster and maintains such a devotion
               to God, the most holy Virgin, and the saints (P.R.P.).

                    The  congregants  will  endeavor  to  be  sincerely  and
               interiorly pious and devout while worshipping God and when
               honoring the most holy Virgin and the saints. They will nurture
               the most tender love toward the adorable Lord Jesus Christ,
               meditating  on  his  love  and  his  suffering  for  us  every  day.   94
               They will celebrate with devotion, with an intimate feeling of
               faith, reverence, and love the mysteries and the feasts, which
               the holy Church celebrates (C.R.).

                    The  novices  will  practice  simple,  sincere,  and  fervent
               piety without affectation, scruples, and illusions, and cultivate
               the substance of piety more than its forms. Specifically, they
               will cultivate the following:

                    1.  Devotion  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  -  Because  the
               novices are consecrated to the Divine Heart, they will honor it
               by  meditating  on  its  Passion  and  by  fostering  its  interests.
               They  will  also  nurture  particular  devotion  to our  Lord  Jesus
               Christ  in  the  mysteries  of  his  Infancy,  Passion,  and  Holy
               Sacrament.]]></page><page Index="95"><![CDATA[2.  Devotion  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary.  -  They  will
               honor  and  hold  her  as  mother,  specifically  praying  to  the
               Immaculate  Heart  of  Mary,  which  forms  one  Heart  with  the
               most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  far  the  conversion  of  sinners
               (R.L.P.).

                    By faith, they will always see the guardian angel on their
               side  giving  him  the  precedence,  and  will  be  particularly
               devout  to  the  Patriarch  St.  Joseph,  founder  of  the  Little
               Retreat, and special patron of the pious institute, invoking him
               in the morning and at night (R.L.P.).

                    Both  superiors  and  subjects  must  be  diligent  to
               constantly improve the observance of the religious practices,
               beginning  with  the  meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our  Lord
               Jesus  Christ  in  the  morning,  and  the  Last  Things  or  divine
               benefits in the evening, and consider the inner pains of our
               Lord every  day.  We also  must be  attentive  to  celebrate  the
               ecclesiastical feasts and ours such as the first-fruits, July first,
               the  vigils,  the  monthly  devotions,  the  most  holy  name  of
               Jesus along with the presentation of our petition, etc.; as well   95
               as  the  virtue  contest about humility,  obedience,  and mutual
               charity (Resolves, June 17, 1920) .

                    The Rogationists will foster devotion to the saints, giving
               the preference to the ones who are nearest to our Lord Jesus
               Christ  and  the  most  holy  Virgin.  Because  the  Rogationist
               institute's aim is obedience to the command of Jesus: « Pray,
               therefore,... », the congregants will be particularly devout to
               the apostle saints, especially Peter, Paul, and the evangelist
               John, saying a specific prayer to each of them on their feast.

                    The  least  congregation  of  the  Rogationists  must  never
               forget that it is greatly indebted to the glorious St. Anthony of
               Padua  for  its  economical  existence  as  well  as  for  many
               spiritual gifts; therefore, it will foster in particular,]]></page><page Index="96"><![CDATA[a special particular devotion to this great saint, honoring him
               during  the  year,  especially  on  Feb.  15  and  on  June  13
               (R.R.C.).

                    So that worship to God and devotion to the saints may
               proceed regularly and effectively, we are obliged to observe
               the .liturgical rules, making use of statues and sacred images.
               So  that  the  Rogationists  and  their  employees  may  enjoy
               abundantly spiritual benefits and a more effective protection
               of our Lord Jesus Christ, the most holy Virgin, the angels, and
               the  saints  they  will  join  many  pious  unions  in  the  Church
               without obligation of conscience.


                                   2. MEDITATION

                    Christian,  religious  life  cannot  exist  without  meditation
               and  prayer;  both  are  indispensable  for  attaining  en-
               lightenment and help from heaven.

                    The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  be  fond  of  prayer,   96
               knowing  that  without  it  they  will  be  unable  to  do  anything
               good,  nor  will  they  be  capable  to  improve  holy  virtues.  By
               neglecting prayer they will lose any good, their vocation, and
               their own soul as well.

               a) Meditation and Communion

                    I heartily exhort the Daughters of Divine Zeal to be fond
               of  meditation,  because  it  is  the main  preparation  to  receive
               Communion  worthily,  and  because  it  nurtures  the  spirit  of
               effective  prayer  to  win  any  grace  from  God;  furthermore,
               meditation prompts the soul to reach the highest perfection.

                    The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  must  be  convinced  that
               they  will  never  receive  a  profitable  Communion  without
               prayer, that their existence as a religious institute]]></page><page Index="97"><![CDATA[is tied to Jesus in the Holy Eucharist, and that if the spirit of
               prayer is lacking everything will come to nothing.

                    My daughters in Jesus Christ, you must understand that
               your individual spirituality and growth in holiness as well as
               the  institute's  temporal  existence  and  improvement  depend
               on your receiving the Eucharistic Communion frequently and
               worthily through prayer; otherwise Jesus will became greatly
               disgusted and will stop giving spiritual and temporal graces.
               Remember that your name is Daughters of Divine Zeal. But,
               can  you  be  zealous  for  the  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests  if  you
               wound  him  with  your  receiving  Communion  unworthily?  By
               doing so everything will end such as the spirit of prayer to win
               good workers to the holy Church, your holy zeal for winning
               souls, and you yourselves, will no longer be good educators
               of  the  girls  who  are  entrusted  to  you.  Oh,  what  a  ruin  the
               Communion  you  receive  unworthily  will  bring  about!  If  you
               neglect meditation, prayer will fail and sterility will result. (1)


               b) Meditation and Prayer                                  97

                    Both  philosophers  and  experience  teach  that  our  will
               keeps still if the mind does not know its own good. In other
               terms,  O  soul,  if  you  do  not  know  how  desirable  and
               beneficial the virtue is, you will not ask God for it; neither will
               you endeavor to achieve it through your own cooperation.

                    We  are  pointing  out  that  the  effort  of  prayer  and
               cooperation in achieving a virtue or a grace is always relative
               and  proportionate  to  the  mind's  spiritual  knowledge  or
               enlightenment about that virtue or grace.  If the mind knows
               nothing about the beauty, excellence, and usefulness of such
               a  virtue  or  grace,  it  will  never  be  moved  to  pray  and
               cooperate. If the mind's knowledge about a virtue or grace is
               weak and only speculative and]]></page><page Index="98"><![CDATA[superficial, but is not at all acquired by the gift of the intellect,
               the  will  shall  move  weakly  and  superficially  to  pray  and
               cooperate. On the contrary, if enlightenment and knowledge
               of faith and the Holy Spirit make the mind fully aware of the
               beauty, excellence, and usefulness of such a virtue or grace,
               the whole will shall move entirely and effectively to pray and
               cooperate in order to acquire that virtue or that grace.

                    The mind’s enlightenment and knowledge must not be a
               simple,  natural,  speculative  knowledge  as  the  following
               statement, for instance - virtue is desirable - because no one
               is  moved  to  achieve  the  virtue  by  such  knowledge.  In  fact,
               many people who stand aloof from God know that God may
               punish them in this life and after death for their sins, but that
               does not matter, they continue sinning.

                    Now, prayer or meditation is the indispensable condition
               to  achieve  this  enlightenment  and  knowledge  about  grace
               and faith.

                    Daughters in Jesus Christ, please pay careful attention   98
               to  the  great  importance  of  the  connection  between
               meditation, prayer, and cooperation in order to achieve grace,
               good, and sanctification from God. (2)

                    As  to  the  connection  between  effective  prayer  and
               cooperation in the spiritual order, please note: on one hand
               the  grace  sets  the  will  in  motion,  and  the  good  will  moves
               along with the grace; on the other hand, meditation impels the
               will always to greater activity through the enlightenment of the
               mind; once the will is moved, it determines a way, with all its
               strength, to attain the spiritual objectives, through prayer and
               cooperation.

                    Prayer without cooperation, however, is as imperfect as
               it  is  ineffective.  For  instance,  if  a  person  meditates  on  the
               humiliations our Lord suffered for our sake, resolving]]></page><page Index="99"><![CDATA[to acquire holy humility at any cost, and prays for it, such a
               prayer, to be effective, needs the cooperation of the person
               who wishes holy humility and prays for it. 4n other terms, this
               person  has  to  accomplish  what  is  necessary  to  achieve
               humility,  such  as  humiliating  himself  in  case  of  warning,
               choosing the last place, practicing the humblest jobs through
               obedience, loving and practicing poverty, begging pardon and
               penance for his faults, and the like.

                    This spiritual order is the same for any virtue.
                    By adding our cooperation we make the prayer effective,
               while  our  meditation  moves  us  to  pray  and  to  cooperate
               (S.D.D.Z.).


               c) Meditation and Perfection

                    The daily meditation is the first means which increases
               our awareness of the divine presence making it visible to the
               mysterious  view  of  faith.  It  is  the  source  from  whence  we
               derive both the principle for any action and the ignition for the   99
               enlivening flame of charity and zeal (Speech, April 17, 1915).

                    To form the interior spirit and to perform everything for
               the  sake  of  our  adorable  Lord  Jesus,  nothing  is  more
               efficacious  than  holy  prayer.  It  unveils  our  defects  and  bad
               inclinations,  makes  the  soul  hate  them  and  long  for
               evangelical perfection, and for the kingdom of God, which is
               given  to  those  who  long  and  strive  to  reach  it.  May  the
               probationers  be  fond  of  prayer,  without  allowing  boredom,
               due  to  their  weak  nature,  or  temptation  during  the  prayer
               prevails over. Jesus Christ said: « Keep watch and pray so
               that you will not fail into temptation. The spirit is willing, but
               the flesh is weak » (Mt. 26, 41). (P.R.P.).

                        My dear, we must be convinced of eternity, which is]]></page><page Index="100"><![CDATA[waiting  for  us  with  a  new  order  beyond  the  time  and  the
               boundaries  of  this  mortal  life!  We  are  pilgrims  in this  world.
               God  placed  us  here  for  a  short  time,  to  test  and  make  us
               worthy  of  an  eternal  prize.  Here  nothing  lasts,  everything
               camas  to  an  end,  time  flies rapidly;  today  you  are  children,
               tomorrow youths, the day after tomorrow old, at last eternity
               comes!

                    Millions  and  millions  of  human  beings,  who  dwelt  on
               earth long ago, took this course; they came to life, laved, and
               died. We are on the same run.

                    Who may exactly value the importance and the neces-
               sity of meditation on eternal truths? Meditation should be the
               daily bread of our spirit! If we did it, we would become like the
               just in the words of the prophet: « Happy the man who... finds
               his pleasure in the law of Yahweh, and murmurs his law day
               and night. He is like a tree planted by water streams, yielding
               its fruit in season, its leaves never fading! » (Ps. 1, 1-3).

                    If meditation is necessary to everyone, how much more   100
               necessary it is for you, O clerics. You need to grow in grace
               and  wisdom  as  the  adorable  Savior  did,  gaining  favor  with
               God  and  with  people.  You  need  to  sanctify  yourselves  and
               now is the time! While you are young, while in training, you
               can  strive  to  root  out  the  nascent  passions,  in  order  to
               become obedient to the grace working in you. Please starts
               the work of your sanctification... start it through meditation an
               eternal truths.

                    If  we  often  meditated  an  the  truths  of  faith, if  we  were
               often in the divine presence, if we were fond of prayer, if we
               prayed for hours, if we were fully aware of the mysteries of
               faith in our actions all day long, what mutations would happen
               in us! Bit by bit, a ray of God's infinite splendor would enter
               us,  our  mind  would  be  filled  with  divine  light;  and  darkness
               would be driven away.]]></page><page Index="101"><![CDATA[through divine light we would know how to abhor evil, how to
               embrace good, while a celestial fire would inflame our heart
               and move our will effectively. If we persevered in the exercise
               of meditation, we would become holy; on the contrary, if we
               are  cool  and  attached  to  many  things,  if  our  passions  are
               alive, if our mind is dull, if we are lacking virtues, all this is
               due  to  our  lack  of  meditation.  We  do  not  nurture  our  spirit,
               and it becomes exhausted; we deny ourselves the bread of
               life,  and  it  is  always  remains  as  faint  as  dying;  the  spirit’s
               eyes  are  blind,  its  ears  are  deaf,  its  palate  does  savor  the
               taste  of  the  celestial  things  any  longer.  Thus,  while  the
               starving spirit declines, the body boldly takes over. In short, if
               we  do  not  become  spiritual,  it  is  because  of  our  lack  of
               meditation (Speech, Oct. 1891).


                             3.THE FRUIT OF MEDITATION

                       The  morning  meditation  must  be  on  the  most  holy
               passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. While meditating, the soul
               will imagine the scene or the picture of the meditation event,   101
               such  as  the  garden,  the  arrest,  the  courts,  the  insults,  the
               scourging, the way of the Calvary, etc.
                       After  doing  so,  the  soul  reflects,  discusses  things,
               considers.
                       Sentiments, prayers, and resolves are the three items
               on which the fruit of meditation rests. Specifically they are the
               exercise  of  loving  feelings  toward  the  suffering  Jesus,  the
               petition to know, love, and serve him with humility and fervor,
               the determined resolves to never offend him, to amend, and
               the like.]]></page><page Index="102"><![CDATA[SENTIMENTS.  To  excite  the  sentiments,  you  need  to
               consider two main factors:

                    1.  Jesus  suffered  for  you  in  a  particular  way  what  he
               suffered  for  all,  as  if  you  were  the  only  person  to  be
               redeemed.

                    2. To redeem you, the shedding of a single drop of his
               blood,  or  enduring  the  lightest  annoyance,  or  uttering  a
               simple prayer to his eternal Father would have been enough.
               Why, during his whole life, beginning with his incarnation, did
               he  want  to  suffer  so  many  spiritual;  infinite pains?  Why  the
               hardship,  discomfort,  continuous  want,  and  the  Passion  of
               incredible  torments  in  his  most  delicate  members,  the
               agonies  of  his  loving  Heart,  all  of  which,  the  human  mind
               cannot understand? Why did he want to be wholly ruined and
               consumed with so many pains, each one more terrible than
               the other, and he suffered everything for you, when, in fact,
               he  could  have  saved  you  without  the  suffering?  You  must
               know it: he did so in order to oblige you to love him!
                                                                         102
                    You  will  meditate  on the  adorable  Passion of  our  Lord
               Jesus Christ with these ideas as well as with those that your
               love will excite; when the Lord brings into evidence to you the
               sufferings he endured for your sake, and you find one of them
               overcoming and winning you to his Heart, then you will gay
               with great affection: « My love, it is enough, stop suffering: I
               surrender  myself  to  your  love;  see  to  it  that  I  endure  the
               remnant  of  your  Passion,  dying  for  you.  »  Then,  if  you  are
               truly humble, penitent, and loving, you will add what the Lord
               inspires you to say. (3)

                    PRAYERS. Besides the sentiments, the prayers are also
               the result of meditation. We need to profit by the]]></page><page Index="103"><![CDATA[precious time of meditation, when the soul is in union with
               God, to ask the graces and mercies of which we are in need
               (the  prayer  itself  will  show  us).  We  have  to  ask  the  divine
               lover  for  forgiveness  of  our  sins,  holy  per-severance,  and
               holy virtues praying ardently for the adorable Heart of Jesus'
               interests, for sending out good workers to the holy Church,
               and for the conversion of sinners.

                    RESOLVES. Because the resolves are the outcome of
               meditation,  they  must  never  be  neglected.  When  a  person
               during the meditation is moved and afflicted for the most holy
               Passion of Jesus Christ, she will promise to never grieve him
               again, to amend from the defects in which she usually falls,
               and to practice specific virtues; as well as to overcome the
               predominant  passion,  to  control  herself  when  she  is
               humiliated, to observe the rules of the institute, and the like.

                    When a person practices meditation in such a way, she
               will rapidly grow in holiness (S.D.D.Z.).

                                                                         103
                                4. ETERNAL TRUTHS

                    The  probationers  will  meditate  together  every  day,  in
               the morning and in the evening, making use of some book.
               The  topics  of  their  meditation  will  be  the  Last  Things,  the
               mysteries of our Lord Jesus Christ and his divine mother, the
               divine perfections, and the divine benefits, either general or
               particular.  Their  favorite  topic,  how-ever,  will  be  the
               meditation on the inner pains of the most holy Heart of Jesus
               (P.R.P.).

                    The  sisters  will  meditate  together  three  times:  in  the
               morning  before  the  mass,  for  at  least  half  an  hour,  in  the
               afternoon for fifteen minutes on the Heart of Jesus' inner]]></page><page Index="104"><![CDATA[pains, in the evening for fifteen minutes alternatively on the
               eternal truths and the divine benefits.

                    Since meditation on the eternal truths pervades the soul
               with holy fear of God, which is the beginning of wisdom, it is
               of great importance. This meditation instills the beneficial fear
               of sin in the soul as the Holy Spirit, said: « In everything you
               do, remember your end, and you will never sin » (Eccl. 7, 40).
               Hence  no  sister  will  consider  the  meditation  an  death,
               particular or  universal  judgment  of God,  hell  and  its  eternal
               suffering,  abomination  of  sin,  and  punishment  of  God  on
               earth  and  after  death  as  it  were  unnecessary.  The  Eternal
               Truths and The Way to Salvation by St. Alphonsus M. Liguori
               are of help to meditating (S.D.D.Z.).


                               5. THE DIVINE BENEFITS

                    The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  are  bound  in  duty  to
               meditate  on  the  divine  benefits  of  natural  and  supernatural
               order  that  each  and  all  of  them  received  generously  from   104
               God.

                    Nurturing in their heart an intimate gratitude toward the
               divine, eternal benefactor God the Father, the Son, and the
               Holy  Spirit  for  the  creation,  redemption,  and  the  means  of
               sanctification, the sisters will never neglect the meditation on
               the divine benefits in order to excite their intimate feelings of
               thanksgiving,  praise,  and  blessings  toward  Gad,  the  most
               holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary, the angels and the saints.

                    To foster gratitude and to frequently thank the Lord, the
               booklet by Sarnelli on the Divine Benefits is of great help.

                    A breath or a bit of bread or a little useful abject cannot
               be underestimated, because it is a grace coming]]></page><page Index="105"><![CDATA[from the Lord. We have to get used to consider everything as
               a great gift of the Lord, as it really is. For instance, if you get a
               pin you need, please say in your inner-most, a thanks, God;
               how great your goodness is! » or the like. No gift is a little one
               when it comes from God, or from the divine Heart of Jesus
               that  shelters  the  infinite,  eternal  love  of  God  for  human
               beings. If we have faith, we will not think of finding a pin by
               chance, by coincidence; on the contrary we will see Jesus as
               handing  it  to  us!  If  we  do  that,  no  thing  will  be
               underestimated. If we had the spirit of the saints, we would be
               enraptured  by  the  consideration  of  God's  goodness  who
               prompts the object we need. Let us acquire at least the spirit
               of meditation through our efforts and the divine grace in order
               that we may thank the divine goodness for anything, without
               underestimating  even  the  small  things.  If  we  happen  to
               marvel at the consideration of what a pin or a bit of bread is in
               God,  who  created  them  through  so  many  causes,  our
               marveling will be the result of our meditation.
                                                                         105
                    For instance, let us pick up a bit of bread. Made of flour
               and  water,  it  is  cooked  in  the  oven.  Flour  comes  from  the
               harvest's  seeds  of  wheat.  But  the  harvest,  on  its  turn,  is
               produced  by  other  seeds  of  previous  harvests,  and  so  on
               back through sixty centuries since the creation of the world.
               Providence  kept  fructifying  the  harvest,  which  gave  those
               seeds of wheat, which made the bit of bread, which you are
               about  to  eat.  If  it  is  possible,  let  us  number  the  millions  of
               people  who  worked  through  the  centuries  to  produce  these
               harvests, considering how many times the sun, the earth, and
               the  rain  fecundated  them;  how  many  wooden  or  iron  tools,
               which  imply  millions  of  people  and  minds  working  to  form
               them, were used! Flour, which made the bit of bread that you
               swallow and consume]]></page><page Index="106"><![CDATA[in a moment, was produced in the mill. Haw many things are
               needed to form the mill? Iron was taken from the bowels of
               earth;  linen  was  produced  by  the  plants  that  bred  on  earth
               along  the  centuries,  wood...  etc.  Forming  a  bit  of  bread
               implies millions of people and minds! Please make your paint:
               along the centuries God preserved millions of people to form
               that bit of bread that only you are eating; in fact, only you are
               eating the bit of bread God gave you. We could reasoning the
               same way of the water which was used to work into dough; of
               how it came down from the clouds, went to the sea, and went
               back  to  the  clouds  by  evaporation  over  and  over  again  by
               millions of times. We could say the same thing of how that bit
               of  bread  was  cooked:  we  would  number  more  millions  of
               people  and  minds  who  worked  for  the  linen,  bricks,  coal,
               transfer of stuff, linen, and so on... to form that bit of bread!

                    We  cannot  consider  this  bit  of  bread  a  least  benefit  of
               God; we cannot swallow it without at least saying: «O infinite
               goodness  of  God  who  thought  of  m$  through  so  many
               centuries  and  engaged  innumerable  human  beings,  as  well   106
               as  elements  from  the  natural  world  with  continuous  loving
               care, to prepare this bit of bread for me! For me, when I was
               not yet born!

                    The  Lord  provided  us  with  innumerable  kinds  of  flood,
               linen, clothing, houses, and comforts of life; an each of these
               objects  we  could  reason,  contemplate,  and  find  out  more
               millions of creatures and minds that worked for us, for each of
               us under the Providence's guide!

                    Can we say, then, that the pin we found, when we were
               in need of it, is a thing of little value, instead of saying that it is
               a divine benefit? We could reason in the same way for a sip
               of water or for whatsoever little object.]]></page><page Index="107"><![CDATA[The Lord said that the hairs of our head have been all
               counted and no one of them falls without divine disposition.
               This  saying  teaches  that  even  the  lightest  or  the  most
               irrelevant happening as, for instance, the timely recovery of a
               pin, is grace and kindness of our loving God and a proof of
               his continuous care for each creature.

                    If departing from the marvels of the divine omnipotence
               and  his  goodness  in  forming  a  bit  of  bread  or  some-thing
               useful,  we  proceed  to  the  reign  of  grace,  we  will  discover
               greater  and  sublime  marvels  by  considering  what  the  Lord
               did, operated, and suffered to give each one of us even the
               least  grace!  Each  person  would  say:  «  The  divine  Word
               became man for me, suffered 34 years for me... is dwelling in
               the Holy Sacrament for me; He created the angels, his most
               holy  mother,  and  the  saints  for  me;  He  formed  the  holy
               Church,  the  doctors,  the  preachers,  the  confessors,  the
               pontiffs,  the  bishops,  the  priests,  the  temples,  the  religious
               orders, etc., for me.
                                                                         107
               The  point  of  fact  is  that  Christians  share  in  everything
               because they belong to God's family through the communion
               of the saints. A word or an enlightenment of the mind leading
               to goodness holds the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ as well
               as the prayers and works of the most holy Virgin, the angels,
               the saints, the Church, and the just all over the world!

                    0 soul, please see how each ,person is bound in duty to
               always  thank  God,  the  most  holy  august  Trinity,  for  the
               benefits he receives as though he were alone on earth!

                    While traveling and thirsty, St. Teresa was given a cup of
               water by a charitable 'person, whom she never forgot in her
               prayer to the Lord. Because any good comes from God, we
               are  not  afraid  of making  a mistake  by  saying  that  the  saint
               thanked the Lord for that cup of water all her life long.]]></page><page Index="108"><![CDATA[Following this example, we have to remember any good
               encounter  in  order  to  thank  the  Lord  either  with  a  simple
               thought or an internal act by saying for instance, « My Jesus,
               I thank you for that factor event or preservation or encounter.
               » Even though these things seem to be trifling matter, really
               they are not because they were disposed by divine wisdom.

                    We  also  add  that  the  events  or  things  or  apposition  or
               suffering that are unpleasant to the senses or to the spirit are
               worth  our  thanksgiving,  because  everything,  even  God's
               punishment, depends on Him and is for our good. Owing to
               these considerations, we must thank God.

                    Happy the person who goes deeply into the science of
               gratitude  we  owe  to  God  for  everything,  great  or  small,
               prosperous  or  unpleasant  thanking  Him  not only  when  they
               come  to  pass,  but  also  when  she  remembers  them
               (S.D.D.Z.).


                           6. IMPEDIMENTS TO MEDITATION                  108

                    1.  Distractions.  We  have  voluntary  and  involuntary
               distractions. The voluntary distractions are sins more or less
               grave depending on our awareness and consent of our will to
               them.  Because  they  destroy  the  fruit  of  the  prayer,  making
               matters  worse,  the  person  has  to  battle  vigorously  against
               them.  The  involuntary  distractions  are  those  that  are
               opposed, rejected, and disliked.

                    As long as one strives hard to dispel the distractions in
               order to remain in the divine presence and to meditate with
               affection,  prayer,  and  resolves,  the  involuntary  distractions
               are not at all sins. The fathers of spirit hold that meditation is
               beneficial  even  when  all  of  the  time  is  spent  in  dispelling
               distractions.

                    However,  the  people  must  know  that  they  may  be
               responsible for the distractions that enter. No one can]]></page><page Index="109"><![CDATA[say,  «  I  am  not  responsible.  »  In  fact,  distractions  mainly
               come in because we are not mortified nor dead to ourselves.

                    It  is  worse  when  distractions  arise  because  of  our
               previous  dissipation,  which  originate  from  talking  vainly,
               having attachments, and the like. Usually the chief cause of
               distractions  during  meditation  is  attachment,  because  the
               object or the people to whom we are attached come to our
               mind.  If  opposed  and  rejected,  these  distractions  are
               involuntary in act, but voluntary in cause, but dispelling them
               is  harder,  however,  because  of  their  voluntary  cause.  A
               mortified,  diligent  person  seldom  undergoes  distractions
               during  meditation,  and  when  it  does  hap-pen  she  dispels
               them easily.

                    Hence,  everyone  will  deduce  how  much  she  must
               humiliate  herself  before  God  because  of  the  distractions
               which interfere with meditation; and even though there is no
               sin  in  act  when  she  regrets,  retracts,  and  condemns  the
               causes, still she must plead guilty before God. Retracting the   109
               cause of  distractions is truly sincere when the soul amends
               her attachments and the daily dissipations as well as devotes
               herself to mortification and exercise of holy humility.

                    Besides doing so, the soul has to spray fervently to the
               Lord in order to win over distractions, or better yet, to impede
               them  from  oppressing  during the meditation,  and  the  Lord's
               help will not fail, because he said: « Without me you can do
               nothing » (Jan. 15, 5).

               2. Temptations. To impede the soul to take advantage from
               the meditation, the never sleeping hellish enemy is always on
               guard  fostering  distractions  and  causing  temptations  by
               exploiting the human failings of the soul.

                       As  to  the  temptations,  we  emphasize  that  having  a
               way of living which gives the enemy the opportunity of]]></page><page Index="110"><![CDATA[tempting  us  during  the  meditation  is  like  giving  weapons  to
               our enemy. To win the temptations we must be mortified.

                    Consenting to the enemy's temptations is a grave, mortal
               sin if the object to which we consent with full deliberation is
               grave. To easily repel the enemy's temptations at their rising
               as  well  as  to  become  quick  to  repel  them  during  the
               meditation,  everyone  must  take  diligent  care  to  become
               mortified.  Each  one  must  beware  of  giving  our  enemy
               opportunity  of  perilous  temptations  by  putting  herself  in  the
               occasion; for instance, if someone complains with the people
               against  the  superior's  orders,  the  enemy  finds  that,  person
               inclined to insubordination and may urge her to disobey or to
               fight by pride: on the other hand, the person who is already
               inclined to disobey, may consent to it. Usually the temptation
               pattern is always the same, but the skillful enemy knows very
               well either the temptation he is going to use or the passions
               he is going to stir to make the soul fall into his snare.

                    To overcome distractions we must pray, but to conquer
               the  temptations  we  must  pray  more.  By  combining    110
               mortification  and  the  avoidance  of  occasions  with  fervent
               prayer to the adorable Hearts of Jesus and Mary we obtain
               the grace to overcome the temptations.

                    3. Sleep. Sleep is a great enemy to same people while
               meditating. St. John Climacus holds that sweep derives from
               the devil's temptation, exploiting the sours laziness or from a
               weak  nature  or  from  abundant  food  or  from  the  habit  of
               sleeping excessively. It may also derive from lack of sufficient
               sleep. Sleeping during the meditation is a great thief, since it
               steals the whole profit of meditation when the soul consents
               to it without striving to prevail over.]]></page><page Index="111"><![CDATA[How to battle against sleep in order to prevail over it? By
               a  determined  will  and  by prayer.  The  people  taking  care of
               their spiritual good do their best to overcome sleep during the
               meditation. 0 soul, when you are troubled with sleep, hate it,
               moan, humiliate yourself, and pray over again to the adorable
               Heart  of  Jesus;  Immaculate  Mary,  your  patron  angels  and
               saints; do novenas and penance.

                    To dispel sleep during the meditation, you will use some
               practical means such as standing and kneeling alternatively,
               without  leaning  on  the  pew  and  without  putting  your  hands
               before your eyes. It is also advisable that the superior entrust
               someone  with  awakening  the  lazy.  In  a  community,  those
               who slept during the meditation were ordered by the superior
               to  plead  guilty  in  public  and  to  skip  breakfast;  this  policy
               produced a quick improvement, making evident that good will
               is  sometimes  lacking,  while  appropriate,  sensitive  penance
               proves useful.

                    Should sleep derive from overwork or lack of sleep-time,
               the superior will remedy the situation.                   111


                    4. Aridity. It may originate from present or past faults that
               are under punishment by the Lord. In this case, the person
               must humiliate herself remaining steady in the meditation by
               operating  with  a  pure  will.  If  she  consents  to  aridity  and
               surrenders to it, she loses the benefit of the .meditation and
               comes out of it worse.

                    When the person remains steady, operating with will and
               mind,  even  though  without  sensible  pleasure,  she  loses
               nothing from meditation, on the contrary she makes a point
               by  using  aridity  in  order  to  purify  herself  and  to  improve
               firmness and virtue. After showing her faithfulness in this way,
               the  divine  groom  will  make  her  feel  his  presence  in  faith,
               while  darkness  of  aridity  will  vanish,  and  the  rays  of  the
               groom's face will shine.]]></page><page Index="112"><![CDATA[7.     SPIRITUAL READING

                    Since  it  is an  important  factor  of  sanctification,  spiritual
               reading  will  be  always  in  force  in  our  houses.  When  the
               people  listen  to  it  in  silence  with  interior  and  exterior  quiet,
               they seem to be meditating. Spiritual reading may be public
               or private.

                    Successful  spiritual  reading  is  like  a  beneficial,  gentle
               rain  which  irrigates  the  soul,  penetrates  the  heart  sweetly,
               and spreads wide inside the person to her great pleasure and
               profit.  In  the  meditation  one  may  not  always  be  able  or
               disposed to attract the stream of grace in a sensible way, or
               she has to make many efforts; in spiritual reading instead, the
               soul  receives  the  sweet  stream  of  grace  passively  and
               specifically. To profit by it, each one must be attentive, as if
               Jesus  himself  were  speaking  to  her  with  the  wards  of  that
               took; in fact, any good spiritual reading is from God.

                    a)  Reading  in  common.  The  superior  will  take  care  to
               appoint the readers by turns, choosing the ablest ones. Light,   112
               hoarse  or  unpleasant  voices  must  not  be  considered.  Even
               though they may be few, the people having sound, pleasant
               voices  and  an  understanding  of  the  reading,  take  turns,
               adapting the voice modulation. The superior will see to it that
               the  reading  to  well  timed,  and  the  punctuation  marks
               observed.  If  the  readers  will  follow  these  rules  exactly,
               reading  clearly  and  contritely,  the  message  will  enter  the
               hearers'  soul  sweetly  and  pleasantly.  They  will  be  like
               evangelical  preachers  proclaiming  the  word  of  God.
               Furthermore, if the readers have the intention of sharing the
               hearers' merits as well as the merits that the people loose for
               their  fault,  they  will  share  in  them.  Everyone  attending  the
               reading  will  pay  careful  attention  to  it,  dispelling  any
               distraction  as  well  as  gathering  and  keeping  the  reading's
               divine teaching in their heart.]]></page><page Index="113"><![CDATA[b)  Reading  in  private.  Private  reading  is  also  of  great
               profit to the soul. By permission of the superior or the master
               each one may make use of a book she considers useful. If
               you  happen  to  feel  drawn  to  meditate  on  some  specific
               passage  while  reading,  please  do  it  because  it  will  be
               helpful.


                   c)  Books of spiritual reading. Books of spiritual reading,
               either  public  or  private,  are  allowed  after  having  been
               previously examined. When a youth enters the community,
               her  books  must  be  examined  in  order  to  destroy  those  of
               unsound  doctrine.  Reading  books  written  by  saints  are
               preferable to the works by modern authors about perfection.
               They may be used with permission along with the Rodriguez
               treatise.  The  book  of  books,  however,  is  the  Holy  Gospel
               according  to  the  four  evangelists.  Reading  it  frequently,
               especially  in  the  month  of  June,  which  is  dedicated  to  the
               most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  is  strongly  suggested.  You  will
               also read the remnant books of the New Testament as word
               of God. Those of the Old Testament are also beautiful and of   113
               great  profit,  especially  the  Psalms  by  David,  the  books  of
               Wisdom, and the Prophets: some others, however, are to be
               left out of your reading.

                    Books of passion, such as novels, must be absolutely
               avoided,  even  though  they  combine  profane  with  sacred
               ideas. « Fabiola » only, by Card. Wiseman, may be admitted
               because of its edifying reading (S.D.D.Z.).


                                      8. PRAYER

                    Interior life, union with God, zeal, charity, and thirst for
               souls  give  the  people  of  God  a  great  weapon  to  per-form
               great  things  for  the  Lord  and  for  souls,  not  through  their
               personal work, sacrifices, money, and talent, but]]></page><page Index="114"><![CDATA[through  the  invisible,  or  better  yet,  the  visible  help  of  the
               divine  power.  This  weapon,  which  helps  us  prevail  over
               everything,  this  golden  key,  which  opens  the  treasure  of
               divine  grace,  is  prayer.  A  servant  of  God  (14  said  this
               impressive, unforgettable sentence in his preaching: « God is
               omnipotent, but prayer is the most omnipotent! » Just so! If
               we  priests  or  those  bound  in  duty  to  save  souls  used  it
               always, the Church's mystical fields would blossom (Speech,
               April 17, ...)!

                    God gave us prayer as the great means to win any grace
               and the probationers will pray every day considering it as the
               divine treasure's key. Please exhort the probationers to hold
               prayer in great esteem, and to implore from God the victory
               over  themselves,  as  well  as  divine  love,  the  spirit  of  holy
               virtues, the achievement of their aim, .perseverance, a good
               death,  and  eternal  life.  Since  the  lovers  of  God  desire  the
               good of others as well as their own, the probationers of this
               little  community,  which  is  devoted  to  the  adorable  Heart  of
               Jesus' consolation, will also pray for the interests of the divine
               Heart every day... basing their hope of improvement on the   114
               spirit of prayer. If they pray, everything will be well; if prayer is
               lacking, the source of grace will become dry, and everything
               will came to nothing. May God avoid that (P.R.P.)!


               a) importance of prayer

                    Everyone  will  hold  prayer  in  great  esteem,  dedicating
               himself to it all life long, because our Lord wanted all graces
               to depend on it. He said: « Ask, and you will receive; seek,
               and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you »
               (Mt. 7, 7). Let us bring into focus two points: necessity and
               efficacy of the prayer.

                        1. Necessity of prayer. The theologians teach that]]></page><page Index="115"><![CDATA[prayer is absolutely necessary for our eternal salvation, and
               without prayer no one can be saved. Our Lord Jesus Christ
               recommended it to us over and over again teaching us how to
               pray, especially through the Our Father, nearly compelling us
               to pray following his own example. Even though he needed
               no prayer to obtain graces, being himself omnipotent God like
               the Father and the Holy Spirit, still he always prayed to win
               graces  from  the  eternal  Father  for  the  holy  Church  and  for
               souls until the end of the time. All graces, the least and the
               greatest  as  well  as  the  spiritual  and  temporal  which  are
               granted to the creatures on earth were obtained and prepared
               by  Jesus,  our  supreme  goodness,  through  his  divine,
               continuous prayers.

                    But  even  though  he obtained  and  prepared the  graces
               for  us,  by  divine  decree  no  grace  comes  to  us  without  the
               cooperation  of  our  prayer.  Prayer  is  the  opening  key  of  the
               infinite  treasure  of  graces.  No  prayer,  no  grace.  The  souls
               that  ask  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  will  receive.  Both
               credited  revelations  and  interpretations  of  many  passages   115
               from the prophets say that even though our Lord Jesus Christ
               is the author of any grace, still he prayed for himself to win
               from his Father the help and strength his most holy humanity
               needed to work out our redemption.

                    If our Lord prayed to win grace for himself from God, and
               he  had  no  need  to  do  so,  who  can  obtain  graces  from  the
               Lord without praying? Just as our Lord Jesus Christ prayed,
               so did the most holy Immaculate Mary all her life long, in spite
               of  being  born  holiest  and  unable  to  fall  into  the  least
               imperfection. And yet, she prayed in every moment of her life
               for  herself  and  for  others;  in  union  with  the  prayers  of  our
               Lord  Jesus  Christ  she  obtained  and  prepared  the  graces
               necessary for our salvation and]]></page><page Index="116"><![CDATA[sanctification. She obtained and prepared them, but we are
               bound in absolute duty to ask for them through prayer.

                    The saints were wisest in profiting by this great means.
               To be saved, to improve heroic virtues, to conquer and throw
               down any inordinate passion, overcome any difficulty, prevail
               over  wonders,  the  saints  prayed  continuously.  They
               cooperated  by  hard  work  and  sacrifices.  Works  and
               sacrifices,  however,  would  have  been  of  no  value  without
               fervent  and  continuous  prayer:  Both the  uselessness  of  our
               efforts and the necessity of prayer for our sanctification are
               pointed out by these words of our Lord Jesus Christ: « You
               can do nothing without me » (Jn. 15, 5). It is obvious that we
               can do no goad far ourselves and others without the help and
               the  enlightenment  of  our  Lord,  but  we  can  obtain  this  help
               and enlightenment by praying.

                    2.  Efficacy  of  prayer.  Prayer  is  necessary  because  our
               Lord grants no grace without prayer; the sacred writers say
               that  prayer  is  as  necessary  for  spiritual  life as  breath  is  for
               natural life because prayer is the breath of the soul. Prayer is   116
               also as necessary as it is effective. This is a consoling truth,
               because if we pray with faith, fervor, and due dispositions our
               prayer reaches Gad, obtaining what we ask for.

                    This certainty is based on this promise of our Lord Jesus
               Christ:  «  Ask,  and  you  will  receive;  seek,  and  you  will  find;
               knock, and the door will be opened to you» (Mt. 7, 7). He also
               narrated the parable of the friend knocking at a friend's door
               and  asking  for  three  loaves  (Lk.  11,  5-8)  as  well  as  the
               parable  of  the  widow  who  got  justice  from  an  unjust  judge
               who was reluctant to do so (Lk. 18, 1-8). On another occasion
               he said: «Would any of you who are fathers give your son a
               snake when he asks]]></page><page Index="117"><![CDATA[for fish? Or would you give him a scorpion when he asks for
               an  egg?  As  bad  as  you  are,  you  know  how  to  give  good
               things to your children. How much more, then, the Father in
               heaven will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him » (Lc.
               11, 11-13)!

                    Besides,  he  solemnly  said:  «  I  tell  you  the  truth:  the
               Father  will  give  you  whatever  you  ask  of  Him  in  my  name.
               Until now you have not asked for anything in my name; ask
               and you will receive, so that your happiness may be complete
               (Jn. 16, 23-24). If you ask me for anything in my name, I will
               do in) (Jn. 14, 14). Given all these solemn promises, who can
               doubt about the prayer's divine efficacy? Who can doubt that
               the Lord hears us? Is there any excuse for those who get no
               graces for lack of prayer?

                    The  power  of  prayer  is  also  based  on  the  fact  that
               through his divine merits, and his suffering and prayer of 34
                                                                   '
               years our Lord has already acquired and Obtained everything
               we  ask  for  from  the  Father.  When  we  pray  with  good
               dispositions,  we  are  praying  with  Jesus  and  in  Jesus,  and   117
               Jesus  himself  prays  from  within  us  to  win  the  graces  we
               need. Oh, how much we should thank the divine goodness
                             '
               for  having  given  us  prayer  and  for  having  annexed  so
               powerful, a divine efficacy to it!

                    How did the saints sanctify themselves? Through prayer.
               How  did  they  happen  to  enrich  themselves  with  virtues,  to
               prevail  over  the  world,  hell,  passions,  and  become  like
               celestial  beings?  How  did  they  happen  to  be  totally
               transformed in Jesus Christ becoming one with him? Through
               prayer; through a continuous miracle of prayer.

                    By considering the prayer of the saints we realize that it
               was no languid, submissive, dormant, scarce, and without the
               due dispositions as it unluckily happens to the]]></page><page Index="118"><![CDATA[Religious  who  are  little  concerned  both  with  their  sancti-
               fication  and  with  the  glory  of  Gad  and  the  good  of  their
               neighbor.  Their  prayer  was  associated  with  the  due  dis-
               positions of the effective prayer.


               b) Means to make the prayer effective

                    We are dealing with the prayer's efficacy regarding the
               Religious who are bound in duty to long for sanctification, to
               grow  in  it,  to  want  the  glory  of  God  and  the  good  of  souls
               through  the  perfect  unfolding  of  the  institute's  mission,  to
               which they are committed. We are talking to you, Daughters
               of  Divine  Zeal,  whose  name  Divine  Zeal  engages  and
               compels you to seek with all effort the glory of God, your own
               sanctification,  the  sanctification  of  others,  and  the  present
               and the future souls as well.

                    Which  are  the  dispositions  and  the  conditions  required
               so  that  your  prayer  obtains  anything  you  ask  of  Jesus  for
               yourselves and for others?                                118

                    1.  Cooperation.  Continuous  cooperation  to  attain  what
               you  are  asking  for  represents  the  first  disposition.  For
               instance,  suppose  you  are  asking  the  Lord  to  make  you
               perfect  in  holy  obedience.  Well,  you  must  do  your  best  to
               obey perfectly. Through prayer you receive grace, but grace
               needs  your  cooperation,  which  is  your  work.  While
               cooperation  makes  grace  fruitful,  on  the  other  hand  grace
               increases the help and strength you need for praying. Prayer
               and cooperation increase each other. So that a person may
               achieve  what  she  is  asking  for,  she  must  be  steady  and
               perseverant in this double practice of prayer and cooperation,
               building up the good will that brings prayer and cooperation
               into  action,  since  good  will  is  the  source  of  any  good,
               whereas bad will is the source of any evil.

                        Daughters of Divine Zeal, the development of your]]></page><page Index="119"><![CDATA[good will depends solely on you; while doing so, ask of the
               Lord  the  best  graces  for  his  glory,  for  you,  for  all,  and  for
               everything;  cooperate  with  holy  force  in  order  to  achieve
               what  you  are  asking;  if  you  bring  into  action  the  required
               conditions, you will obtain every-thing.


                    2.   Meditation. That the prayer's efficacy depends on
               meditation is a truth to be taken into serious consideration.
               Meditation  makes  a  person  understand  the  necessity  of
               grace and compels her to ask for it; it makes one understand
               how  much  God  deserves  worship  and  love,  urging  the
               person  to  stay  in  the  divine  presence  in  order  to  implore
               love,  forgiveness,  and  graces;  it  makes  the  person
               understand  her  own  nothingness  and  human  failings,
               drawing her to implore mercy and salvation. The meditation
               on  Jesus  Christ's  mysteries  inflames  the  soul  with  holy
               wishes of seeking, loving, pleasing, and owing Jesus.

                    3.   Longing.  To  be  effective,  the  prayer  and  the   119
               cooperation must be combined by desire. Desire gives wings
               to the will, which makes it fly toward the object of its longing.
               Because  of  that,  the  prayer  full  of  holy  wishes  and  proper
               dispositions is very effective.

                    The more we know and feel ourselves in need of some
               good, the more we desire it; the more intense is the desire,
               the more the soul prays and cooperates to satisfy it. We say,
               pray and cooperate, because our prayer must be combined
               with our cooperation if we really want to achieve what we are
               asking for.

                    Prayer  having  imperfect  or  no  cooperation  implies
               imperfect wishes as we realize from the following saying of
               the  Holy  Spirit:  «  The  idler's  desires  are  the  death  of  him,
               since his hands will do no work » (Prov. 21, 25). Therefore,
               prayer, meditation, cooperation, and striving]]></page><page Index="120"><![CDATA[to form ardent desires to achieve the great, eternal goods is
               our duty.

                    4. Fervor. Ardent desires form the fervent prayer. Happy
               is the soul that prays with great; intense fervor reaching God,
               Jesus, his love, and his union of love! When prayer combines
               the dispositions we have mentioned above with the ones we
               are about to speak of, it pierces heaven and moves the Heart
               of Jesus, winning any grace. We should ask for this spirit of
               fervent, effective prayer, which the Lord does not deny to the
               simple, humble souls that meditate on how to love, serve, and
               glorify him.

                    The Apostle St. Paul wrote: « In the same way the Spirit
               also comes to help us, weak as we are. For we do oat know
               haw we ought to pray; the Spirit himself pleads with God for
               us, in groans that words cannot express» (Rom. 8, 26). This
               prayer  combined  with  tears  and  sighs  is  the,  prayer  that
               formed  saints,  obtained  resources  and  salvation  to  the
               Church, the sinners' conversion, God's glory, and the souls'
               good,  because  such  a  prayer  continues  the  prayers  of  our   120
               Lord Jesus Christ.

                    For  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests  we  recom-
               mend this spirit of prayer to the Daughters of Divine Zeal, in
               compliance with the name they bear, as well as with the vow
               of  obedience  to  the  divine  command:  «Pray,  therefore!  »,
               which  urges  them  to  ardently  protect  the  interests  of  that
               divine Heart. This fervid prayer is the celestial, vivifying rain
               that  waters  the  holy  Church's  fields,  making  spiritual
               vegetation appears in a barren soil.

                    If this spirit of prayer will be as constant as perseverant,
               the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal's  institute  will  be  not  only
               durable  and  deep-seated,  but  will  also  improve  for  God's
               glory, sanctification, good of souls, and holy prosperity.]]></page><page Index="121"><![CDATA[5.      Humility. God opposes the proud, but gives
               the grace to the humble. So that our prayers may reach the
               presence of God and be welcomed by Him, they need to be
               born  of  a  humble,  contrite  heart.  The  prayer  of  a  sister,
               indifferent to being humble, who is attached to her own self-
               esteem,  whose  secret  pride  repels  the  admonitions  and
               warnings  of  the  superior,  who  nurtures  grudges,  and
               restrains  from  humiliating  herself  for  her  faults  or  from
               acknowledging  them;  the  prayer  of  a  sister disregarding  to
               overcome her secret pride, who is rude to her sisters, quick
               to anger (pride is mother of it), and hardly obeys; the prayer
               of a sister who considers herself better than the others, who
               does  not  strive  to  be  humble,  who  perhaps  is  not  even
               humble  in  the  sacrament  of  penance;  the  prayer  of  this
               sister,  who  is  a  Religious  by  name  only  because  she  is
               proud and rejected by the Lord; the prayer of such a sister
               does  not  move  the  Heart  of  Jesus;  perhaps  it  rouses  his
               indignation.

                    Oh! I wish no Daughter of Divine Zeal be so indisposed,
               full of the spirit of the pride's father, who is the devil; I wish   121
               instead that they be Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart of
               Jesus,  the  divine  teacher  who  said:  «  Learn  from  me,
               because I am gentle and humble in spirit » (Mt. 11, 29); if the
               sisters  want  their  prayers  to  be  welcomed  and  granted  by
               the Lord, they must be humble.

                    When a Religious is praying in the divine presence, she
               must  be  fully  aware  of  her  indignity,  being  as  a  guilty,
               miserable  person  who  is  imploring  mercy.  She  should
               annihilate herself in her heart, considering by faith that she is
               residing the presence of the infinite majesty of Jesus Christ
               who  is  our  Lord  and  God,  in  whose  presence  heaven  and
               earth  yield  and  the  angelical  Powers  shudder.  She  has  to
               combine deep humility of heart with]]></page><page Index="122"><![CDATA[a humble attitude of the whole person. While praying let us
               join  ourselves  to  the  humility  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who
               threw  himself  face  down  while  praying!  Let  us  join  the
               unequaled humility of the most holy Virgin Mary, who prayed
               lying  dawn  full  length.  Owing  to  our  many  failing  and debts
               toward  divine  justice,  where  should  we  sink  while  praying?
               That the merciful eyes of the eternal charitable God look on
               us, so that he mercifully bend forward to hear our prayers, we
               need  to  humiliate  ourselves  interiorly  and  exteriorly  in  the
               presence  of  his  divine  majesty,  imploring  mercy  for  us  and
               the people.

                    Happy is the person who brings a treasure of humility in
               her prayer in the divine presence! How many graces she will
               obtain for herself and others!

                    6. Trust. Since trust originates from humility, like humility
               it is an essential element of prayer. A proud person does not
               believe she will obtain anything by praying. But, what is trust
               all about? It is a gentle union with Jesus making us see him
               as  our  loving,  benign,  gentle,  supreme  goodness,  who  is   122
               longing to communicate his graces, and to make us see him
               as our father, friend, brother, spouse, and tender lover. This
               loving trust which remains constant despite contrary reasons,
               drives the humble, loving soul to hug the knees of the loving
               God and to look at him with eyes imploring mercy, even when
               Jesus  seems  unwilling  to  grant  graces  for  just  reasons;  it
               makes the soul follow God when he seems far away, crying
               like the blind in the Jerico's street: « Jesus, my Jesus, hear
               my request; I will cry till you hear me for your mercy, for your
               divine meek heart, and for your glory! »

                    Oh! What a fervent, loving, humble, sweet, tender wards
               a person will say to Jesus when she is full of holy trust; and
               how pleased Jesus is by such a humble prayer]]></page><page Index="123"><![CDATA[full of trust. Such a soul may draw any grace from his divine
               hands!  We  find  such  a  humble,  confiding  prayer  in  the
               Canaanite woman's mouth, which we must keep in mind (Mt.
               15, 21-28).


                    We  must  also  remember  that  such  humility  and  trust
               cannot  dwell  in  a  soul  nurturing  malice,  lacking  sincerity,
               concealing some failings from the confessor, and having no
               filial trust in the superior. Such a great treasure of humility
               and  trust  in  Jesus,  our  supreme  goodness,  is  a  gift  of  the
               soul  loving  simplicity,  hating  lies,  striving  to  grow  in  divine
               love  and  holy  perfection,  praying,  and  being  fond  of
               mortification; a soul of pure intention seeking only God and
               her perfection in God and through God along with everything
               which  concerns  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests.
               When a person strives fully, with humble, confident prayer,
               the Lord will fortify her with his grace.

                    7.  Perseverance.  In  speaking  about  necessity  and
               efficacy  of  prayer,  we  touched  on  perseverance,  which   123
               means praying all one's life long.

                    Prayer  is  the  breath  of  the  soul.  We  breathe  con-
               tinuously,  and  breath  keeps  us  alive.  Breath  and  life  end
               together, so we must pray continuously if we are to maintain
               the spirituality of the soul alive. Prayer, however, cannot be
               always automatic as breath is; to remedy it, we must have a
               mind to always pray while performing our occupations, even
               in  the  night  while  sleeping.  Perseverance  in  prayer  also
               implies repeating the prayers all our life.

                    Our Lord Jesus Christ set the example of perseverance
               in  prayer.  Beginning  from  the  incarnation  up  to  his  last
               breath  on  the  cross,  he  prayed  constantly.  «  Jesus  again
               gave  a  loud  cry,  and  breathed  his  last  »  (Mt.  27,  50). The
               divine Heart included all of his wishes in that]]></page><page Index="124"><![CDATA[cry, the longings for his Father's glory, our salvation, and his
               divine prayers.

                    We  read  in  the  gospel:  «  Then  Jesus  told  them  this
               parable,  to  teach  them  that  they  should  always  pray  and
               never became discouraged » (Lk. 18, 1). We have said that
               even the same prayers must be repeated until the end of our
               life, imitating Jesus who repeated his prayer: « Again Jesus
               left  them,  went  away,  and prayed  the  third  time,  saying  the
               same words » (Mt. 26, 44).

                    The  holy  Church  orders  the  priests  to  say  the  divine
               office  every  day,  repeating  the  psalms  of  the  holy  prophet
               David. While saying novenas or a special course of prayers in
               order to obtain graces, we have to say them uninterruptedly,
               and observing the same schedule. While hoping for a special
               grace  for  the  Lord's  glory  or  for  our  sanctification  or  for  the
               good of souls or the like, we must persevere in prayer always
               seeking the fulfillment of the compassionate Heart of Jesus'
               merciful will.
                                                                         124
                    We must keep in mind the divine teaching of the gospel
               in the parables of the friend who knocks at another friend's
               door  in  the  night  asking  for  three  loaves,  also  that  of  the
               widow  troubling  an  unjust  judge  in  order  to  obtain  justice.
               Despite the denials, both the friend and the widow received
               what they were asking for, because they were troublesome.
               Perseverant prayer achieves the same results.

                    One,  who  grows  feeble  in  the  spirit  of  perseverant
               prayer, also grows feeble in the perseverance of doing good.

                    8.  Attention.  While  praying,  the  soul  must  be  aware  of
               the  divine  presence,  concentrating  an  the  prayers  she  is
               addressing  to  the  Lord,  driving  away  any  distraction,  and
               almost  meditating  on  each  ward,  even  those  of  the  Our
               Father or the Hail Mary or the Glory.]]></page><page Index="125"><![CDATA[c) What we should ask for in prayer
                    The final aim of our prayers will be always God's glory,
               our  sanctification,  and  the  good  of  souls  for  the  greatest
               consolation of the most holy Heart of Jesus.

                    1.  To give particulars, the Religious of this community
               will  ask  that  God  be  known,  adored,  loved,  and  served  all
               over the world. To reach this goal, the Religious will be fond
               of the spirit of prayer aiming at winning good workers to the
               holy Church, in obedience to the divine zeal of the heart of
               Jesus'  command:  «  Pray,  therefore!...;  »  which  forms  the
               object of our great mission.


                    The aim of our prayers is the triumph of the holy Church
               both  in  the  sanctification  of  its  members  and  in  the  holy
               freedom, as well as the exaltation of the Holy See and the
               sacred worship for God's glory.

                    2.  For  the  sake  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  and  his   125
               divine  love,  the  Religious  will  ask  with  ardent  desire  and
               perfect  union  with  his  divine  will,  the  virtues  of  humility,
               obedience,  meekness,  and  patience.  She  will  also  ask  for
               charity toward all; benign charity, patient, fervent, industrious,
               compassionate as well as the true, right, fervent zeal for the
               most holy Heart of Jesus' interests. She will pray for wisdom,
               acknowledgement of her own nothingness, and a knowledge
               of the immense, infinite greatness of God and Jesus, who is
               our supreme goodness. She will also pray to obtain the grace
               of  meditating  deeply  on  the  life,  Passion,  death,  and  the
               mysteries  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  infinite  love.  The  soul
               who is eager for her sanctification will pray with great fervor to
               know Jesus intimately, to love him ardently in the great Eu-
               charistic  mystery,  to  adore  him  devoutly,  to  watch  with  him
               lovingly before the holy tabernacles all over the]]></page><page Index="126"><![CDATA[world. At last, she will petition Jesus in the Holy Sacrament
               for  the  most  intimate  union  of  pure  love  through  the  daily
               Eucharistic Communion; and far the grace to receive him in
               her heart with finest disposition. (5)

                    Remember,  a  soul,  that  to  make  perfect  these  holy
               requests,  and  to  achieve  holy  perseverance  through  a  holy
               death, you must implore it every day from the most holy Heart
               of Jesus' charity and the most holy Virgin Mary, and through
               the  intercession  of  the  angels,  and  the  saints.  So  that  the
               prayer for holy perseverance may be fruitful, you will daily ask
               the Lord for growth in holiness, in holy virtues, and in spiritual
               goods.

                    3. Now let us speak of the effect of our third request. We
               should  ask  the  divine,  infinite  goodness  for  the  good  of
               everyone. Since charity requires of us to love our neighbor as
               ourselves and to desire for each person what we desire for
               ourselves, we should ask the Lord for the sanctification and
               the eternal salvation of all.
                                                                         126
                    a. Over and above what the divine Rogate commands of
               us,  we  must  pray  particularly  far  the  conversion  of  sinners
               with such earnestness as to draw our tears, especially when
               the  matter  is the misled  clergy  or  the  Religious.  We  should
               ask for divine mercy, and for conversion to its love and to the
               perfect fulfillment of their duties. It is also our duty to pray for
               those in power that they may behave in a holy Christian spirit
               for the good of their subjects. In response to the saying of the
               Holy  Spirit  in  the  Eccl.:  «  Do  not  be  late  in  praying  and
               helping those who are being drawn into the abyss, » we will
               pray with solicitous, holy care for the dying, especially those
               who are running the risk of dying in disgrace. While praying
               with  great  tenderness  of  heart  for  all  children,  we  will
               remember those who are not baptized so]]></page><page Index="127"><![CDATA[that they may receive the sacrament of baptism, as well as
               for those who are baptized, that they may grow innocent and
               free from the world and the devil's snare since their tender
               age, and live in an environment of good education to achieve

               good results. (6)

                    That the kingdom of Jesus Christ on earth may rise and
               spread widely on the ruins of the devil's, we must pray for
               the destruction of the kingdom of Satan, for the destruction
               of the devil press, for the overthrow and the annihilation of
               secret  societies  or  hellish  diabolic  sects,  especially  the
               excommunicated  freemasonry,  for  the  complete  defeat  of
               socialism's subversive principles all over the world and of the
               diabolic  Bolshevism's,  which  originated  from  the  unhappy
               Russia!

                    b.   The love of Jesus Christ urges us to pray for our
               neighbor's  temporal  good  when  it  is  subordinate  to  the
               spiritual benefit. Let us pray, therefore, for the vexed people
               so that they may be consoled by God; for those in jeopardy,   127
               to  be  saved;  for  the  abandoned,  to  be  helped  in  their
               tremendous suffering; for the sick, to be healed or attended
               or  relieved  and  comforted,  for  the  prisoners,  to  be  freed  if
               they  are  not  guilty,  and  not  to  be  oppressed  or  abused

               immoderately, if they are guilty. (7)
                    c.   Each  Religious  will  pray  fervently  for  the  spiritual
               and  temporal  well-being  of  the  superiors,  the  superior
               general, the masters, the fellow-members, our houses, and
               the  school-board,  the  students,  as  well  as  for  the  divine
               providence in our houses, the soundness of the fellows, the
               education, the arts and crafts, and the preservation from evil,
               relating  everything  to  our  spiritual  well-being,  to  God  and
               Jesus  Christ's  divine  will.  To  expand  our  intentions  to
               everything and everywhere, we must combine our intentions
               and prayers with the intentions]]></page><page Index="128"><![CDATA[and prayers of our Lord Jesus Christ in his mortal life and in
               the Holy Sacrament, imploring spiritual and temporal graces.

                    4.  Thanksgiving.  It  is  our  duty  to  give  thanks  while
               praying.

                    Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  please  do  not  neglect  this
               highest  duty,  not  only  because  it  is  a  great  means  to  win
               more graces and mercies, but all the more because the great
               donor of all goods deserves the greatest, universal tribute of
               gratitude from each creature. Gratitude shall be a prominent
               virtue  of  this  least  institute,  which  is  consecrated  to  the
               sweetest  Heart  of  Jesus!  Following  the  exhortation  of  St.
               Paul: « In all your prayers ask God for what you need, always
               asking  him  with a  thankful heart»  (Phil.  4, 6),  we  will  never
               cease  giving  thanks  to  the  Lord.  This  way,  the  universal
               prayer will become the fountain of many mercies for us, for
               the holy Church, and for the whole world.

               d) When and were we should pray                           128

                    We must pray always, in any place and any time.
                    It  is  written:  «  They  should  always  pray  and  never
               become discouraged » (Lk. 18, 1); « nothing hinder thee from
               praying  »  (Eccl.  18,  22);  therefore,  by  forming  a  habitual
               intention to pray and give thanks in any moment, we have to
               lift  up  our  mind  to  God  before  any  action  and  service,
               redressing  human  failings,  which  do  not allow  a  continuous
               elevation of the mind in prayer. In his infinite goodness, our
               Lord accepts any laving intention of carrying out what human
               failings or other circumstances do not allow us to.

                    Can  we  pray  while  working?  St.  John  Climacus  wants
               the  people not  to attend  to  anything else  while  praying, but
               his opinion concerns the graver of obligation. (8)]]></page><page Index="129"><![CDATA[The prayer in common is to be vocal, and each one must
               say it because exempting oneself from it would be a serious
               default and the beginning of lukewarmness. We must hold in
               great  esteem  prayer  in  private  and  in  common;  the  private
               prayer, either allowed by obedience or required by a specific
               devotion, is of great profit to the person who knows how to
               deal  with  God  tête  à  tête,  in  the  solitude  of  her  heart;  the
               prayer  in  common  wins  the  graces  from  the  Lord  easily,
               because  God  cannot  help  granting  graces  to  the  prayer  in
               common, on condition that the people pray with fervor, faith,
               and pure intention — says St. John Chrysostom.

                    Any time is good for prayer, but special times are more
               suitable to win graces, because they are more acceptable to
               God  as,  for  instance,  the  time during  the  celebration  of the
               holy mass; then heaven unfolds to pour out graces on earth
               since  our  prayers  join  our Lord  Jesus  Christ's  prayers,  who
               immolates himself on the altar as victim of atonement for our
               sins,  reconciling  us  to  God.  Another  acceptable  time  for
               prayer is that of Holy Communion, when Jesus is in our heart
               through the host. Isn't it the time to make true the following   129
               words of the apostle: « He gave us his Son — will he not also
               freely give us all things » (Rom. 8, 32)?

                    The liturgical feasts are also acceptable times for prayer.
               Just as the kings of this world are more favorably disposed to
               grant favors on their saint's day or on the anniversary of their
               coronation and victories, so the adorable Lord Jesus Christ is
               more disposed to  hear  us  in  the  days  set  to  commemorate
               the mysteries and the triumphs of  his divine love for human
               beings; the same happens to the most holy Virgin Mary, the
               angels, and the saints on the days of their feasts.

                    Hence, we shall profit by these solemnities by appealing]]></page><page Index="130"><![CDATA[humbly  and  confidently  with  petitions  and  prayers  in
               order to obtain what we need; these favorable opportunities
               cannot be missed. (9)

               e) To wham must we pray?

                    1. We must pray to God, one and triune, the most holy
               Trinity, from whom any good proceeds.
                    We pray to the eternal Father through the merits of his
               Son, our Lord.
                    We  pray  to  Jesus,  our  supreme  goodness,  in  the
               practices of piety, devotions, holy masses, Communions, and
               always. (10)
                    We  pray  to  the  adorable  third  person  of  the  most  holy
               Trinity,  the,  holy  and  divine  Paraclete,  on  whom  any
               sanctification  depends.  We  must  pray  to  him  fervently,
               especially in his novena and feast, asking for his seven gifts
               as  well  as  for  the  achievement  of  the  12  fruits.  When  a
               person receives the gifts of the Holy Spirit, she becomes holy
               and perfect:                                              130

                    2. After the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we pray
               to the mast holy Virgin Mary, because Jesus tied his graces
               to the powerful, loving intercession of his and our most holy
               mother Mary. (11)

                    3.  Let  us  also  pray  to  St.  Joseph,  Immaculate  Mary's
               most holy spouse, the Son of God's putative father, the Holy
               Family's  head,  the  universal  patron  of  the  holy  Church,  the
               special protector of the people of any class and condition, the
               greatest among the saints, powerful in heaven and distributor
               of the divine graces.

                    4.  Let  us  also  pray  to  the  powerful  St.  Michael  the
               archangel,  head  of  the  celestial  army,  most  zealous  for  the
               divine honor, conqueror of Lucifer, leader and guardian of the
               holy Church, assistant master of the good]]></page><page Index="131"><![CDATA[death, protector and visitor of the holy souls of purgatory.

                    5.   Let us pray to St. Gabriel the archangel, the mes-
               senger  of  the  good  news,  a  special  guardian  angel  of  the
               most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  fortress  of  God,  and  courage  of  the
               shy; to St. Raphael the archangel, medicine of God, sure and
               faithful  guide  in  the  life  pilgrimage;  to  our  dearest  guardian
               angels,  who  are  our  faithful  friends,  guide,  help,  light,  and
               comfort  since  our birth;  to our  beloved  saints,  whose  name
               we bear since our baptism; to the patron saints we draw by
               lots  every  year  in  a  spiritual  industry  of  ours;  to  the  saints
               whose  lives  edify  us,  and  especially  to  the  Celestial
               Rogationists of Jesus' Heart.

                    6.   In  a  special  manner  let  us  pray  to  the  powerful,
               great  benefactor,  wonder-worker, and  saint of  all  the  world,
               St. Anthony of Padua, also appealing to the patron saints of
               the cities where we have communities as well as to the saints
               who won graces for us. Our thanksgiving will always join our   131
               prayers  to  God,  the  most  holy  Virgin,  the  angels,  and  the
               saints. (12)


               f) Various formulas of prayer
                    The best prayer our Lord Jesus Christ taught us is the
               Our  Father.  Several  devotional  books  can  help  us  both  to
               understand  the  various  interpretations  and  to  keep  them  in
               mind while praying, being fully aware of its divine words and
               petitions.

                    Next to Our Father is the Hail Mary. The second part of it
               is  as  important  as  effective.  The  rosary,  taught  by  the  holy
               Virgin is also an excellent prayer, because the saying of the
               Our Fathers and Hail Marys is combined with the meditation
               on the mysteries of the life, Passion, death, and resurrection
               of our Lord Jesus Christ, and]]></page><page Index="132"><![CDATA[on the mysteries of the most holy Virgin. Our communities will
               say it every day. The litany of the most holy Virgin is another
               celestial prayer that follows the rosary.

                    Prayer  books  written  by  the  saints  as  well  as  the  «
               Filotee  »,  like  the  one  by  Riva  in  vigor  in  our  communities,
               contain plenty of beautiful prayers. We must be very fond of
               our  prayer  book  because  it  contains  specific  prayers  which
               are related to our houses and to the birth and progress of our
               institutions. The after-mass prayers may be said in private or
               in common.

                    Divine are the prayers of the Holy Scripture, especially
               the holy prophet David's psalms; in the private recitation they
               may be said in the Latin or the Italian version. Even though
               the Italian version is more understood, the Latin is preferable;
               in  the  recitation  in  common,  however,  the  Latin  version  is
               binding.

                    Inspired are also the various prayers of the Church such
               as the Oremus, which mean « let us pray » (we may also use   132
               them in private devotion), as well as the majestic Litany of the
               Saints,  which  we  say  in  our  communities  in  particular
               circumstances.

               g) The heart's prayer

                    The  most  effective  prayer  is  the  one  coming  from  the
               heart. The person who is skilled in mental prayer, meditation,
               and mortification; the, person feeling the love of Jesus along
               with his Heart's interests; the person zealous for knowing and
               loving  Jesus,  feeling  compassion  and  ardent  zeal  for  souls;
               this person who is dedicated to virtue and sacrifice, needs no
               formulas of prayer, because the Spirit, dwelling in her, makes
               her  groan  inexpressibly.  To  obtain  divine  graces  for  divine
               glory and salvation of all, she will pray with lively ardor and
               will annihilate herself before God and Jesus' divine presence,
               kissing his]]></page><page Index="133"><![CDATA[adorable feet and looking at the supreme goodness with most
               tender  trust.  Beautiful,  wise,  loving,  convincing  words  will
               come from her heart longing for the Heart of Jesus' interests,
               winning the graces, which the world does not deserve. Tears
               will well up to the eyes, and sighs from the heart, as from a
               fountain. To better touch the Heart of her divine spouse and
               win  graces  for  God's  glory  and  salvation  of  souls,  which
               would  seem  almost  impossible  to  obtain,  this  person  will
               combine  her  ardent  prayers  with  her  effusive  and  diffusive
               thanksgiving  for  the  graces  that  the  Lord  has  granted,  is
               granting, and will grant to everyone. Kneeling down with the
               hands  raised  to  the  sky  or  to  the  crucifix  or  to  the  holy
               tabernacle,  she  will  be  as  the  priest,  between  the  vestibule
               and the altar, moistening the ground with tears, if necessary.

                    Her prayer will become one with our Lord Jesus Christ's
               divine prayer; the wails of her soul will be the wails of Jesus
               in the solitude, in the caves, on the mountains; her sighs will
               be the sighs and the prayers of Jesus suffering in his Passion
               from  the  garden  to  the  cross,  up  to  the  loud  cry  when  he
               breathed his last; her prayers will be the divine petitions that   133
               God,  the  eternal  pontiff  hidden  in  the  Holy  Sacrament,
               repeats for us until the end of time.

                    When  this  person  who  is  united  with  Jesus  through
               meditation and the sacrifice of herself is obliged by obedience
               or common life to interrupt her prayer, with all her heart she
               will make her time and actions an actual or habitual prayer;
               the  night  will  be  also  a  suitable  time  for  her  to  pray  more
               ardently and passionately in union with Jesus, and even while
               sleeping  she  will  pray  in  union  with  Jesus,  at  least
               intentionally and by protestation and desire.

                    No one but God knows the graces this person wins]]></page><page Index="134"><![CDATA[from the adorable Heart of Jesus, in favor of the holy Church,
               the  pilgrim  souls,  the  souls  who  are  in  purgatory,  and  the
               whole  world.  No  one  but  God  knows  how much  her  prayer
               pleases the most holy Heart of Jesus. It was to this praying
               person that the Holy Spirit spoke in the words of the celestial
               spouse: « The flowers appear on the earth... the cooing of the
               turtledove  is  heard  in  our  land...  Come  then,  my  love,  my
               lovely one, come. My dove, hiding in the clefts of the rock, in
               the coverts of the cleft of the rack let me hear your voice; for
               your voice is sweet » (Songs 2, 12-14). The voices coming
               from the heart, longing for my glory and for goodness of souls
               are utterances of paradise.

                    Even  when  this  person  forgets  herself  in  the  prayer  to
               the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests,  she  will  leave  her
               prayer in a holier state than before, sharing the good she has
               obtained for souls, the divine glory she has caused, and the
               celestial  consolations  she  has  given  the  beloved  Heart  of
               Jesus.  I  wish  such  souls  were  in  all  communities  that  are
               consecrated to Jesus!
                                                                         134
               h) Exhortation

                    Our padre talks to his daughters in Jesus Christ:
                    You along with the future Daughters of Divine Zeal must
               know and keep in mind that this Pious Institute of the Heart of
               Jesus' interests, along with the two religious communities, the
               orphanages  and  the  institutions  originated,  improved,  and
               was formed through prayer; especially through the prayer and
               the yearly petition we presented to the eternal Father in the
               most holy name of Jesus in January, believing our Lord Jesus
               Christ's divine, ineffable promises. Through such petitions we
               asked  the  divine,  infinite  goodness  for  special  graces  of
               sanctification and formation in the Lord for this pious institute;]]></page><page Index="135"><![CDATA[we asked the kingdom of God along with its justice, basing
               our faith on our Lord Jesus Christ's merits of infinite value, on
               his divine word, and also on the most holy Virgin, the angels,
               and the saints' powerful intercession.

                    We point out that the prayers we have made in any time
               and  circumstances,  especially  during  the  mass,  the  feasts,
               and  embarrassing  situations  were  accompanied  by  the
               conditions we have talked about in this detailed chapter. At
               the  same  time,  we  have  endeavored  to  combine  the  works
               with prayer, avoiding even the least venial sin by deliberate
               assent; we have done our best to help our neighbor spiritually
               and  corporally  for  God's  sake  only,  always  imploring  good
               workers  for  the  holy  Church  in  compliance  with  our  special
               mission, besides practicing various spiritual industries` Thus,
               divine  mercy  bent  down  toward  this  small  grain,  blessed  it,
               looked favorably at the poor of his divine Heart and said: «
               Grow and multiply!

                    The  community  is  bound  in  duty  to  keep  in  mind  such   135
               things, knowing that when the unvarnished faith in the prayer,
               in the yearly petition, in the spiritual industries grows feeble
               — God forbid! — when the vision of the pure, right intention
               grows dim — God forbid! — when the spiritual industries are
               neglected  —  God  forbid!  —  when  even  the least  deliberate
               defect  does  not  matter,  then  the  door  is  open  to  the  devil,
               who will come in to ravage the sheepfold! Disgusted, God will
               withdraw  his  grace,  will  stop  looking  favorably  at  this  pious
               institute,  to  which  he  has  been  so  loving  and  has  given  so
               many  benefits,  holding  it  as  his  own  no  longer;  on  the
               contrary, he will become indignant at it, because the more he
               benefits and cherishes an institute or a community, the more
               he becomes indignant at it when it becomes unfaithful! Then,
               everything Will go to ruin: what has been built for so]]></page><page Index="136"><![CDATA[long,  even  for  centuries,  will  fall  down  decaying  in  a  short
               while, as unluckily happened to so many institutes once holy
               and blooming in the holy Church.

                    The  superiors,  above  all,  will  pay  careful  attention  to
               avoid slackening in the communities by maintaining observ-
               ance  along  with  the  exercise  of  holy  virtues,  by  strongly
               opposing  the  least  deliberate  defect,  and  by  dismissing  the
               people who offer no hope; they will be also watchful in order
               to prevent false vocations from entering the community. Let
               us  pray  that  the  Lord  give  us  the  people  of  true  vocation,
               whose hearts are with Jesus, whose thoughts are turned to
               Jesus,  and  whose  minds  understand  the  Heart  of  Jesus'
               interests, their own sanctification, and the salvation of others
               as well (S.D.D.Z.)!


                            9. TO JESUS THROUGH MARY

                    a) The secret of holiness
                                                                         136
                    The additional great love that must burst into flames in
               your heart is for the great mother of God. Dearest daughters,
               you  know  well  that  you  cannot  love  Jesus  without  loving
               Mary, that you can go to Jesus through Mary only, and that
               Immaculate  Mary  has  been  ,proclaimed  superior,  owner,
               mother  and  master  of  this  institute;  therefore,  love  and
               devotion  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  should  be  a  peculiar
               characteristic of this order (Speech, St. Joseph, 1908).

                    You  wrote  to  me  about  our  sweetest  mother,  owner,
               master, and superior's entrance in this lucky community, (13)
               making  my  cool  heart's  flint  spring  a  few  tears!  May  your
               Immaculate  Mother  in  Sorrow,  and  superior  bless  you
               daughters,  disciples,  and  subjects  filling  you  with  her  most
               elect graces in order to make you always grow more in the
               holy fervor of love and service for]]></page><page Index="137"><![CDATA[the  consolation  of  the  Celestial  Queen  of  Hearts.  By  loving
               and  serving  this  great  mother  we  can  know,  love,  and
               possess  through  charity  the  supreme  good, our  Lord  Jesus
               Christ, who must be our last and supreme goal. The people
               who seek Mary, find Jesus; those who do not seek her, do
               not  find  him.  She  is  the  door  leading  the  beginners  in  the
               spiritual  life  to  Jesus,  and  makes  the  proficient  ones  enter
               Jesus' nuptial hall and the wine-cellar which enraptures them
               with  divine  love.  By  loving  the  most  holy  Virgin  with  great
               transport you will grow in virtues belonging totally to our Lord
               Jesus Christ.

                    Love  for  the  most  holy  Virgin  mainly  consists  in  the
               imitation of her virtues, especially humility, purity, strong and
               constant love for our Lord, zeal for his glory and salvation of
               souls  as  well  as  great  charity  and  meekness  in  all
               encounters.

                    During my trip (14) I have experienced a great treasure
               of devotion to the most holy Virgin, a secret of sanctification,
               which opens a new horizon on the luck of belonging to the   137
               most  holy  Mary,  helping  find  Jesus  through  her.  This
               particular devotion was outlined by a great servant of God,
               who was beatified some years ago. The devotion I bring to
               you with the Lord's help is like a priceless treasure from far
               off  that  will  fill  the  proclamation  of  immaculate  Mary  as
               mother, owner, master, and absolute superior; it is like the
               answer of the most holy Virgin to our proclamation, and I am
               glad to announce it in reply to your touching statement about
               our sweetest mother and lady's lovely entrance.

                    Everything you had arranged for the hearty reception of
               our sweetest mother was wonderful, inspired, and pleasant
               to  her  and  her  divine  son,  Jesus,  our  goodness.  I  did  not
               deserve being there, so I went on unaware of it. On Saturday
               19, however, I went to the feet of our]]></page><page Index="138"><![CDATA[Rapid Hearer in the cathedral to sing her praise, but I had no
               image of Our Lady of the Letter. After finding one in a book, I
               exposed it all day long. This way, the most holy Virgin called
               me back to Messina.

                    Through the doctrine of that blessed servant of God I am
               going to make you belong totally to the most holy Virgin and
               to Jesus through her. (15)

                    Now I bless you all, but in a special way I bless the one
               who must impersonate the most holy Virgin's superiority and
               holiness. I hope to see you all strengthened and blooming in
               the  spirit  of  religious  observance,  in  the  exercise  of  holy
               virtues,  in  the  zeal  for  your  own  sanctification,  and  in  the
               fervent  prayer  to  win  numerous,  holy  workers  to  the  holy
               Church.

                                                Sincerely,
                                        Your servant in Jesus Christ,
                                     Padre Mary Hannibal Di Francia.
                                                                         138
               b) Slavery of lave

                    To redeem human beings, who where slaves of Lucifer,
               Jesus  Christ  took  the  nature  of  a  servant,  making  himself
               subject to the Father and the most holy Mary.

                    The most holy Mary was the creature most obedient to
               God, being perfectly conformed to His will. Saying, however,
               that she was a servant because she said « I am the Lord's
               servant, » is the slightest thing we can say since God would
               have never accepted Mary's servitude if such servitude were
               not servitude of love. It follows that we must make ourselves
               servants of Jesus for love.

                    This  servitude  starts  with  the  baptism  that  changes  us
               from servants of sin into servants of Jesus Christ. We must
               be  fully  aware  of  this  truth  cooperating  with  our  will  and
               making ourselves conscious servants of our]]></page><page Index="139"><![CDATA[Lord Jesus Christ. We, however, are unable to do so without
               being servants of the most holy Mary out of love. This is the
               secret!  This  was  the  revelation  the  Holy  Spirit  made  to  St.
               Louis M. Grignion (Speech, Oct. 25, 1908).

                    Let  us  consider  how  great  is  the  privilege  of  being
               servants  of  the  most  holy  Virgin.  The  aim  of  this  sacred
               servitude  is.  to  become  perfect  servants  of  our  Lord  Jesus
               through the most holy Mary, confessing him as our Lord and
               God,  serving  him  with  faithfulness,  and  doing  his  adorable
               will.  Oh,  what  a  glorious  servitude!  Through  it  we  belong
               totally to Jesus and Mary, who unite us to their divine Hearts
               by making us share their graces!

                    This  sacred  servitude  of  perfect  love makes  us  perfect
               children  of  Jesus  and  Mary  by  freeing  us  from  the  devil's
               snares, by improving our knowledge and love for Jesus and
               Mary,  by  granting  us  many  blessings  during  our  life  and
               death, and by making us happy for ever, if we are faithful and
               persevering.
                                                                         139
                    To reach this great glory, we have to prepare our-selves
               by prayer imploring enlightenment and grace from the most
               holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary as well as from the Holy Spirit;
               we  have  to  acknowledge  our  nothingness  as  well  as  to
               renounce the world, sin, the devil, and our passions in order
               to improve our knowledge and love for our Lord Jesus Christ
               and the most holy Virgin, our sweetest mother and lady (From
               the « Way of Preparation to the Sacred Servitude »).


               c) The Sacred Servitude's chief points
                                              Rome, May 13, 1906 (16)

                       The Marian Servitude's chief points as I understand
               and apply them to myself are the following:]]></page><page Index="140"><![CDATA[1. I do not belong to myself any longer, but to Mary. My
               body  and  its  physical,  social  rights,  senses,  faculties,  ect.
               belong to Mary, who may dispose of it at her will.

                    2. The soul and its spiritual, intellectual faculties as well
               as its powers, rights, etc. belong to Mary.

                    3. The merits, graces, virtues, either past or present or
               future,  that  I  may  have  or  practice  with  God's  omnipotent
               help, belong to Mary.

                    4.  What  I  possess  for  any  reason,  either  things  or
               persons, as for instance the rights of the physical, civil, social,
               moral life, etc. belong to Mary; just as a slave and his things
               belong  to  an  absolute  owner  and  lady  who  purchased  or
               received him as a slave gift, so my things belong to Mary.

                    5.  Since  this  donation  and  servitude  are  going  to  be
               eternal, so also the eternal glory that I hope to receive in a
               Christian  spirit,  belongs  to  the  most  holy  Mary,  who  may
               dispose  of  it,  making  other  creatures,  she  wants  to  save,   140
               share  in  it  according  to  her  pleasure.  While  making  this
               donation, I humbly request that my power to love God and the
               most holy Mary for ever and beyond measure be not reduced
               by my glory's renunciation.

                    6. This perfect, complete servitude will be practiced by
               means of the following:

                    a. Meditation on the servitude of love and renovation of
               it.

                    b. To have a virtual or at least a habitual awareness of
               the  servitude  in  order  to  receive  everything  in  any  moment
               with humble gratitude from my owner's hands as her gift or
               grace.

                    c. In order to act or use the physical, intellectual,]]></page><page Index="141"><![CDATA[moral, and spiritual life, I have to ask at least the virtual
               permission of the most holy Virgin.

                    d.  I  will  avoid  any  in  and  work  the  greatest  good,
               because  a  servant  must  take  care  of  the  lady's  things,
               behaving according to her will.

                    e.  I  will  endure  any  cross,  suffering,  humiliation,
               opposition,  etc.  as  serious,  lovely  punishments  from  the
               celestial owner, who aims at my atoning and amending.

                    f.  Basing  everything  on  my  filial  love  through  the
               consideration  that  I  am  a  son,  who  out  of  love  wants  to
               become a servant of the celestial queen; or that she adopts
               the servant as a son, making me a son and a servant out of
               love.

                    7.   It is fitting that this servitude for becoming a perfect
               servant  of  Jesus,  our  supreme  good,  bring  about  Jesus'   141
               reign in me perfectly, through the most holy Mary.

                    8.   If  until  now  I  have  sought  to  find  and  possess
               Jesus without succeeding, it has been because I circled the
               mystical city's walls without entering through the door: now is
               the  time  to  enter  through  the  door  which  is  the  most  holy
               Mary. Amen!

                            10. DEVOTION TO ST. JOSEPH


                    Since  this  least  congregation  is  placed  under  St.  Jo-
               seph's  special  protection,  the  congregants  will  honor  and
               love him as the Virgin Mary's spouse and the Son of God's
               virgin  father.  They  will  take  the  habit  and  the  vows  on  the

               feast of their patron (C.R.). (7)
                    As great means of sanctification and progress, the most
               holy Virgin disposed that her holiest virgin spouse]]></page><page Index="142"><![CDATA[St. Joseph be your particular protector and that the taking of
               the garb and the vows be under his auspices every year. Haw
               beautiful  and  powerful  is  the  great  Patriarch's  special
               protection! He watched over, and saved this little seed, this
               humble institute from so many stormy events which tossed it
               about as if it were a little flower among the whirls of a violent
               storm threatening it with death! He invited the people to come
               here, formed vocations, provided both souls and bodies with
               spiritual  and  material  means;  he  opened  a  new  epoch  of
               providence and public progress for you and our orphanages
               through St. Anthony of Padua's graces and miracles. To them
               we are so very much obliged! The great Patriarch St. Joseph
               will  be  your  model  of  interior  virtue,  of  love  for  Jesus  and
               Mary,  and  of  any  most  elect  virtue  (Speech,  St.  Joseph,
               1908).


                         11. THE HOLY ANGELS' PROTECTION

                    Honoring the holy angels will be always in vigor in this
               order.  The  glorious  St.  Michael  the  archangel,  special   142
               protector  and  defender  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation  of  the
               Heart  of  Jesus  and  of  its  institutions,  will  be  honored  in  a
               special  way.  Also  the  seven  angels  who  are  in  the  divine
               presence will be honored through some daily homage. Equal
               devotion will be attributed to the holy guardian angels through
               a daily invocation and the yearly feast (C.R.). In His infinite
               goodness God granted them to all people for their protection.

                    The angels are celestial princes who contemplate God’s
               face,  as  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  said  (Mt.  18,  10).  Wholly
               spiritual and simple by nature, they are of a higher rank .than
               we humans. But even though we are inclined to evil and born
               in  wickedness,  the  angels  esteem  and  take  care  of  us  for
               God's infinite charity.]]></page><page Index="143"><![CDATA[If we happen to fall in grave sins, disfiguring the image
               of  God  in  ourselves,  the  guardian  angel  will  never  stop
               protecting, assisting, and inspiring us to good, because he is
               a  most  faithful  friend.  Happy  are  they  who  hear  and
               understand his calm and ardent inspirations in the midst of
               stormy  passions.  In  the  opinion  of  the  sacred  authors,  the
               guardian  angel  not  only  protects  and  leads  our  soul  to
               eternal life, but also takes care of our body looking after our
               spiritual and temporal life...

                    The guardian angels keep us continuously under their
               protection,  freeing  us  from  a  thousand  disasters,  mis-
               fortunes,  accidents,  perils,  and  calamities  which  are  quite
               unknown. Not even a loving mother has as much tender care
               of her children as the holy angels have for each of us!

                    We know our true friends when we are in trouble, when
               worldly  friends  turn  their back,  more  than  often,  in  spite of
               their friendly declarations. The holy guardian angels, instead,   143
               are always faithful, and the more we are in trouble, the more
               they take care of us.

                    In public misfortunes or calamities all guardian an-gels,
               by mutual consent with the angel or archangel or principality
               or patron or guardian of the nation, or of the people who are
               struck  by  divine  punishment,  lend  help  to  our  need.  By
               evidence from the Holy Scripture and common opinion, each
               nation  has  been  given  an  angel  of  the  principalities  as  a
               guardian and defender. This is the meaning of the following
               words:  «  When  the  Most  High  gave  the  nations  their
               inheritance, when he divided the sons of men, he fixed their
               bounds according to the numbers of the sons of God » (Deut.
               32, 8). Origen wrote: « In the beginning earth was distributed
               to the angels » (Homily, 35 in Lk.). In times of calamities, the
               holy angels]]></page><page Index="144"><![CDATA[show greater zeal and intercession before God in benefit of
               the people as well as of each of us.

                    When  God  got  angry  with  his  people  threatening  them
               with extermination, Moses prayed and obtained mercy. When
               God  is  going  to  punish  us,  our  guardian  angels  do  what
               Moses did because they were assigned to the human beings
               to  protect  them;  besides,  God  likes  being  deterred  from
               punishing  humankind,  cooling  down  His  anger  because  of
               human prayer and penance.

                    How  many  times  the  holy  guardian  angels  pray  for  us,
               begging mercy from God, who is about to punish us! This is
               why Isaiah calls the angels ambassadors of peace (Is. 33, 7),
               Origen, our spiritual doctor (Homily, II in Song), and St. John
               Chrysostom, light of souls, supporters of bodies, defenders of
               the goods, also adding that « we are supported and helped at
               land  and  sea,  we  are  enlightened  and  consoled  in  our
               tribulations as well as freed from sickness by the angels. »

                    To  win  their  protection  in  time  of  public  or  private   144
               calamity, we have to nurture a sincere devotion to these most
               faithful  guardians,  purifying  our  soul  from  sin.  If  we  are  not
               afraid of eternal death, how can we hope that the angel will
               free  us  from  temporal  death?  .If  we  do  not  step  offending
               God, we cannot pretend to be delivered from His punishment.
               In fact, we read in the Scripture: Many men died because of
               the sin (Rom. 5, 15). « By sin whole races are disgraced »
               (Prov. 14, 34).

                    It is written: « If a man fears the Lord, evil will not come
               his way » (Eccl. 33, 1). «They (the angels) will support you in
               case you hurt your foot against a stone; you will tread on lion
               and adder, trample on savage lions and dragons » (Ps. 91,
               12-13). These passages are speaking of the strength that the
               holy guardian angels infuse]]></page><page Index="145"><![CDATA[into the souls of the devout in order that they may overcome
               the hellish enemy's temptations even by treading on the
               proud Lucifer. The holy angels protect the devout who are in
               the midst of epidemics, which destroy human lives in the
               cities and wherever they run their course.

                    That  so  many  priests  and  holy  virgins  who  attend  un-
               tiringly  the  people  infected  or  stricken  with  cholera  are  not
               affected,  is  due  to  the  dear  guardian  angels'  particular
               protection. If God sometimes wants to crown these heroes of
               charity with martyrdom, the guardian angels will double their
               protection in the transfer of these souls to eternity, introducing
               them to God.

                    How much God protects those who fear and trust him is
               shown  by  the  three  Hebrew  children  in  Babylon  when  they
               were thrown in the burning furnace by Nebuchadnezzar's will.
               Sent  by  God,  an  angel  untied  the  ropes,  drove  away  the
               flames  from  the  furnace,  and,  shining  beautifully,  he  began
               walking  together  with  the  three  children  unharmed  in  the
               midst of the surrounding, burning walls; they praised, blessed   145
               God, and invited all creatures to do the same.

                    Everyone  knows  what  the  Angel  Raphael  did  for  the
               young Tobias during his journey, when he accompanied him
               and took him home sound and safe.  He led the way, was a
               guide and comfort, delivered him from the fish that was about
               to devour him, introduced him to the uncle, protected him and
               brought  about  his  marriage  with  Sarah;  at  last  he  took  him
               home rich and happy, and caused Tobias' father to recover
               from blindness.

                    Even though we were sinners and negligent in the past,
               if we want to Win the holy guardian angels' protection in time
               of epidemics, earthquakes, war, or any other public calamity,
               we must begin purifying our conscience from all the obstacles
               that oppose divine clemency and mercy]]></page><page Index="146"><![CDATA[without  loosing  heart.  By  benignity  and  compassion,  God
               declares in the sacred Scripture that he will come back to us
               as soon as we go back to Him; humanly speaking, he even
               forgets our sins when we repent with all our heart. Therefore,
               let us approach the holy Eucharist; by so doing we attract the
               angels of heaven around us, and we become dreadful to the
               spirits of hell. While approaching the Sacrament, let us repeat
               with fervor our resolves to sin no more, preferring to die in the
               public calamity rather than to offend God. After doing so, we
               will  cease  to  invoke  our  holy  angels'  protection  in  the
               calamity, saying special prayers and urging others to do the
               same with confident appeal.

                    It is remarkable what the guardian angels do in order to
               deliver  children  from  serious  perils!  Abandoned  to
               themselves, children often run serious risks or falls, but the
               guardian  angels  watch  over  them  keeping  them  sound  and
               safe. In amazement the people exclaim: « It is obvious that
               the guardian angels save children! » Well then, all of us are
               children  before  our  guardian  angels,  if  we  purify  our
               conscience  from  our  faults,  entrust  ourselves  to  them  with   146
               holy simplicity, and invoke their help.

                    From how many perils, unknown to us, we are delivered
               by  the  holy  angel  of  God!  No  person  may  have  escaped
               some risk without help of his guardian angel. Therefore, we
               must  nurture  in  our  heart  devotion  to  the  holy  guardian
               angels,  who  will  always  be  our  most  faithful  friends  in  our
               quandaries  and  in  public  calamities.  Children  and  youths
               must be especially devout because their guardian angels are
               zealous  for  keeping  them  safe  from  the  perils  of  gin  and
               eternal damnation.

                    When the hour of death nears, happy is the person who
               heartily nurtured the beneficial devotion to the holy guardian
               angel! His angel will be beside him with loving]]></page><page Index="147"><![CDATA[care as a tender mother, fighting against the hellish enemies

               before the tribunal of Jesus Christ, just judge.

                    The holy guardian angel's protection for the person who
               loved and honored him on earth continues in purgatory. That
               tremendous prison of fire and inexpressible torments is to be
               feared  more  than  any  calamity  on  earth!  Well  then,  the
               guardian  angels'  merciful  service  in  favor  of  their  charges
               continues  in  purgatory.  By  inspiration,  they  urge  parents,
               relatives, and friends to pray for those souls; they touch the
               hearts,  pray,  offer  the  divine  masses  to  the Lord,  and  even
               visit the holy souls in purgatory to comfort and console them.
               What next? When the angel obtains the eternal freedom for
               the soul entrusted to him, what a glorious day is that one!

                    The  angel  goes  to  him,  and  says:  «  Your  time  of
               expiation  is  over;  come  with  me  in  the  kingdom  of  glory!  »
               What a joy when the angel of God introduces the devout to
               his Creator and Redeemer in the eternal home! Over there,   147
               the guardian angel will share his happiness with the creature
               he  protected.  There  the  elect  will  bless  God  forever  for  the
               guardian angel's creation and appointment, seeing in God the

               guardian  angel!  This  joyous  contemplation  along  with  the

                        12. THE CELESTIAL ROGATIONISTS (18)

                    I  think  that  you  have  received  and  performed  the
               proclamation of the lovely, glorious St. Francis of Sales]]></page><page Index="148"><![CDATA[as  celestial  Rogationist  after  explaining  the  ceremony  to
               these children, inspiring them with fervor and lifting them up
               to heaven on the strong wings of faith! I am mailing four more
               proclamations reminding you that the ceremony is private. If
               you  are  going  to  accomplish  it  before  the  mass  and  the
               people are in the church, you can do it even in the choir.

                    The  proclamation  papers  are  to  be  preserved  in  a
               dossier, which must be glued or sewed after recording them
               in a register so that they may be read in the refectory every
               year  the  day  before  their  anniversary  in  order  to  offer  the
               mass to the Celestial Rogationists.

                    We  proclaim  Celestial  Rogationists  or  Daughters  of
               Divine  Zeal  those  male  and  female  saints  we  honor,  love,
               admire, and invoke, believing that they would like to become
               Rogationists  or  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal.  By  this
               proclamation  they  become  our  celestial  vocations!  In  the
               course of time, the celestial vocations will increase.

                    While  human  events  reduce  our  ranks  and  impede   148
               vocations,  through  such  proclamation  we  are  becoming  an
               army  or  a  community  so  numerous  to  outdo  whatever  else
               before long! What a grace of the Lord! We will be a crowded
               religion  in  the  midst  of  an  uncrowded  religion  on  condition
               that holy, pure, and candid faith be of assistance to us, in the
               simplicity of heart. Amen (Letter, Jan. 27, 1916).


                    13. DEVOTION TO THE SOULS IN PURGATORY

                    Praying for the holy souls who are in purgatory is to be a
               preeminent devotion as well as a practice of piety; therefore
               the  probationers  will  often  read  and  meditate  on  purgatory
               concluding the prayer before any action with a requiem. They
               will offer the mass and the Communion]]></page><page Index="149"><![CDATA[to  the  holy  souls  in  purgatory  every  Monday;  in  November,
               they will offer all the exercises of piety (P.R.P.). Before taking
               the  vows,  they  will  make  the  pious  donation  (Heroic  Act  of
               Charity) in favor of the souls in Purgatory (R.L.P.).

                    Piety  for  the  dead  is  as  ancient  as  death  itself.  But
               Christianity, which sanctifies everything, fostered piety for the
               dead beyond measure making a point of remembering them,
               owing to the fact that these souls need our help in order to
               transfer  from  'purgatory  to paradise.  By  reason  of  that,  it  is
               everyone's duty to remember them.

                    Dreadful  is  the  soul's  transfer  from  earthly  life  into
               purgatory.  Without  knowing  how,  the  soul  finds  itself  in  the
               midst  of  the  burning  whirls  overturned  by  the  surrounding
               flames that penetrate inside, making it burn like a flame. The
               soul does not know how to get free from that inner fire; wails,
               squeaks,  and  agonies  are  not  a  remedy  to  the  horrible
               burning, while degrees and duration of pain are as various as
               the defects it must expiate. Some souls suffer more, others
               less; some are condemned to a day prison, others to a month   149
               or a year or 20 years or 50 years or a century prison. Fire is
               not the only pain, because pains are as varied as the faults.
               For instance, if one offended God by gluttony, he is horribly
               tormented by hunger and thirst; if by ambition, he is deeply
               humiliated  and  plunged  by  stench  and  his  own  decaying
               body... Thus, sin is atoned through various pains.

                    Missing  God,  however,  is  the  most  bitter  pain  for  the
               souls in purgatory. God! We do not know him in this world!
               We  are  like  the  blind  by  birth  who  do  not  long  for  light,
               because  they  do  not  know  it!  On  the  contrary,  the  souls  in
               purgatory long for God with an intimate, inexpressible desire
               because  they  saw  Him  when  they  were  introduced  at  his
               presence; they saw his infinite beauty, the beauty enrapturing
               for ever the myriads of]]></page><page Index="150"><![CDATA[the elected; but the vision lasted an instant: on and off! And
               yet, what deep impressions the vision of God left inside them!
               All  flames  in  purgatory  are  not  enough  to  make  the  souls
               divert their mind from that lovely attention. They think of God,
               loving him, longing for him, being eager for him, and desiring
               him: like doves that one taken into custody, they flutter their
               wings over and over the subject of their longing, but in vain.
               They cannot take off to God before satisfying His justice.

                    Oh, what pain this is! How painful is this state for souls!
               They are always on the paint of taking off to God, but they
               cannot;  they  love  God,  but  do  not  see  His  face;  they  are
               queens of paradise, but are taken into custody in purgatory;
               exile is over, but they do not enter their homeland! At least,
               could  they  lift  up  their  petitions  to  God  so  that  their  pains
               might be shortened by prayers! I think of them as saying: «
               Lord, we have sinned; we have been negligent in our duties
               not  worrying  about  our  daily  defects;  little  thefts,  frequent
               rumblings,  and  being  absent-minded  during the  mass,  were
               trifles  for  us.  We  disregarded  penance  for  our  faults  and
               complained  because  of  the  cross  you  sent  to  us.  O  Lord,   150
               please forget our debts; deliver us from these flames burning
               inside us. » In vain! The souls in purgatory are unable to pray
               for  themselves.  They  are  plunged  into  their  bitter  suffering
               without being able to help themselves!

                    However, we can do what they can't. They are unable to
               help themselves, but we are bound in duty by charity to help
               them. The souls in purgatory are our neighbors, as they were
               while living on earth; or better yet, they are our neighbors for
               a greater reason, because they are confirmed in grace, and
               therefore  we  must  take  care  of  relieving  them  from  their
               painful condition. Furthermore, having the means of helping
               increases our duty. To relieve]]></page><page Index="151"><![CDATA[their pain and to hearten them in their most intense suffering,
               we have not to share in their pain, nor to go on pilgrimages,
               nor undergo maceration; some exercises of piety and works
               implying little labor are profitable for those pitiable souls. We
               can help them in many ways such as by hearing and offering
               the mass, which relieves them greatly. We are told that St.
               Gregory once delivered all souls from purgatory with one
               mass. Surely, many souls ascend to heaven from purgatory
               when we offer a mass. We can help them by saying the
               rosary of the most holy Mary in their favor, making them feel
               a paradisiac refreshment, or by offering alms, fast, prayer,
               mortification, good works, and holy indulgences. The heroic
               act of charity, the transfer of all our merits, indulgences, and
               suffrages that we will receive after death, is also helpful for
               the holy souls in purgatory.

                    Now, don't you think that neglecting the elect souls who
               are  wailing  in  the  midst  of  horrendous  pains  is  an
               unaccountable cruelty, especially if we consider how easy is
               for  us  to  help  them?  Please  meditate  a  little  while  on  the   151
               following  truth:  we  are  able  to  relieve  the  souls  who  are  in
               purgatory by doing a little work! What is keeping us waiting?
               Imagine  you  are  entering  a  hospital's  room,  where  on  both
               sides  sick  people,  struck  by  serious  disease  are  lying.  You
               approach a bed and are terrified by the sight of a sick squalid
               face,  the  chest  going  up  and  down  painfully,  and  breathing
               his  last  death-rattle.  You  stand  aloof  frightened,  but  nearby
               you see another man, whose face is disfigured by horrendous
               sores; on his side you see another patient burning with fever
               and thirst and calling to you: « I have not slept for five nights.
               Please help me! » At this pitiable sight, you are moved; your
               eyes  are  wet  with  tears...  But,  imagine  that  you  have  the
               power to heal them in a moment. If you did not do so wouldn't]]></page><page Index="152"><![CDATA[you be the most cruel person in the world? But you are more
               than  cruel  if  you  neglect  the  souls  who  are in  purgatory  by

                       The Israelites were burning with thirst in the desert:
               Moses hit the rock and clear water sprang out to quench their
               thirst. The souls in purgatory are more thirsty than the people
               of  Israel,  and  we  have  the  power  to  quench  their  thirst
               through our prayer and other means. Do you know why we
               have little interest in helping those poor souls? Because we
               are  of  little  faith!  If  we  could  see  the  pitiable  state  of  those
               souls, the whirling flames surrounding them, the divine justice
               punishing them, this view would move us to mercy!

                       If only those souls were able  to make us hear their
               wails!  What  they  would  say  to  move  our  hearts!  I  suppose
               that being unable to concern us with their state is one of their
               most  terrible  pains.  If  they  could,  who  would  resist  their
               complaint?  You  who  have  witnessed  the  death  of  parents,
               relatives, benefactors, and friends, whose souls are probably
               in Purgatory, you would not be so apathetic if you heard their   152
               plaintive  echo  from  purgatory!  But,  if  we  are  not  moved  by
               their pitiable state, even though we can help them with little
               difficulties, at least let our own interest move us, because too
               many  benefits  come  from  the  help  we  give  the  souls  in
               purgatory.

                       Helping  those  souls  attracts  the  protection  and  the
               mercy of God, who delights so much in the appeasement of
               His justice in favor of those elect spirits who are predestined
               to the glory of paradise. When David's anger was appeased
               by the prudent Abigail, he did delight in it, but not as much as
               God  does  when  we  appease  His  scourging justice  with  our
               prayer.

                       In the first book of the kings we read that the prophet
               David was ignited by righteous anger against the foolish]]></page><page Index="153"><![CDATA[Nabal and moved with the army to punish him. But Nabal's
               bride,  the  beautiful,  wise  Abigail  stood  ,in  the  middle of  the
               way, knelt at the foot of the angry prophet, and offering gifts
               prayed: « May your anger fall upon my head, but do not harm
               Nabal.  Please  forgive  his  foolishness!  »  That  prayer
               appeased  David  and  calmed  his  anger,  making  him  feel
               happy for not having punished the fool-hardy Nabal. He said
               to the imploring Abigail, « Blessed be your talk, o woman, and
               blessed are you for restraining me from vengeance through
               my own hands » (1. Kings 25, 33).

                    Likewise, the people who help the purgatory's souls are
               pleasing God, because while His justice scourges the souls.
               His mercy feels sorry beyond measure. Then, let us do what
               the  prudent  Abigail  did;  led  us  offer  gifts  and  petitions  to
               appease  God's  right  anger;  let  us  give  satisfaction  for  the
               faults of those souls, saying what Abigail said to the prophet:
               «  Lord,  do  not  look  on  those  souls'  foolishness,  but  forgive
               their failings. » God's justice will be appeased by our offering
               and prayer; His mercy will prevail over those souls' faults and
               Jesus Christ will say gladly: « Blessed be your speech and   153
               blessed  are  you  who restrained  me  from  punishing  through
               my own hands. »

                    When we relieve the purgatory's souls with our prayer,
               they invoke mercy on us from God. Unlike the worldly people
               who  often  forget their  benefactors,  those  thankful  souls  ask
               God  for  abundant  retribution  on  their  benefactors  with
               constant petitions and with their most effective prayer. Those
               devoted  to  the  souls  in  purgatory  know  all  this  very  well,
               because they have experienced their protection many times.
               For instance, some devout persons were attacked' by thief s,
               but  those  blessed  spirits  appeared'  as  warriors  putting  the
               bandits  to  flight.  Others  overwhelmed  by  dreadful  storms,
               invoked the]]></page><page Index="154"><![CDATA[blessed  souls,  and  were  delivered  by  them;  some  others
               were  in  need  of  sustenance,  and  received  a  quick  helping
               hand from those souls when they invoked them; and people
               struck  by  disease  were  healed'  through  the  intercession  of
               the blessed souls.

                    These devoted to the souls in purgatory will experience
               a  greater  benefit  when  they  themselves  descend  in  that
               abyss. Every one hopes not to fall into the abyss of hell; but,
               who  can  make  sure  of  avoiding  the  purgatory's  fire  before
               going to paradise? Many of the saints we honor on the altars
               paid  something  to  the  divine  justice  in  that  frightful  prison!
               Where do you think we are going to pay the penalty for our
               faults and' daily defects? We will see each other among the
               purgatory's burning flames, and we are lucky if it happens so.
               In  50  years,  most  of  us  now  in  this  church will  burn  in  that
               purifying fire in the abyss. Then, a new generation of people
               will  stay  here,  your  children,  grandchildren,  etc...  Then,  a
               preacher,  perhaps  more  zealous  than  I  am,  will  sermonize,
               trying to move them to .pity on their dead, namely, on us. But
               now please remember what Jesus said: « God will apply to   154
               you the same rules you apply to others » (Mt. 7, 2). It follows
               that if you today neglect  so many souls who are waiting for
               your  help  in  the  horrible prison  of the abyss,  God  will  have
               you  also  neglected  and  the  future  hearers  will  remain
               unconcerned with your suffering, denying their help to you.

                    Let  us  look  after  our  interests.  Time  flies,  death  ap-
               proaches.  Sights  of  death  surround  us.  If  you  follow  my
               exhortation  today,  if  you  begin  interceding  to  relieve  those
               souls, if you remember your forefathers and parents in your
               prayer  today,  Gad  will  make  your  children  pray,  intercede,
               and  relieve  you  from  your  bitter  pain  through  masses  and
               alms!]]></page><page Index="155"><![CDATA[Then, we are lucky! The flames surrounding us will die
               out,  heaven  will  unfold,  and  the  angel  of  God  will  come

                                          NOTES

                   (1)  This  point  was  of  so  great  importance  for  our  padre  that  he
               wrote:  «We  repeat that the  institute's  life along with  its  spiritual and
               temporal existence as well  as  progress is  strictly tied to the Eucharistic
               Communion  we  receive  frequently,  in  a  holy  manner.  But  without  the
               spirit  of  meditation  and    prayer  one  cannot  be  fond  of,  nor  hasten  to
               receive  Jesus  in  the  Eucharist,  nor  be  zealous  for  the  divine  Heart's
               interests.
                   How  can  a  person  long  to  join  Jesus  in  Communion,  when  she
               does  not  kindle  herself  with  the  wish  and  love  of  Jesus  through
               meditation on the adorable Jesus Christ, his Passion, and death? How
               can she understand and desire him in the great mystery of the Eucharist,
               if she does not meditate on this great mystery of infinite love? How can
               she  bring  a  fervent,  immaculate  heart  to  the  Eucharistic  table?  The
               person having no spirit of prayer will never detest sin, because dread of
               sin springs up from meditation on the eternal truths, the Passion, and
               death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wretch daughter, you cannot be called
               Daughter of Divine Zeal any longer, because you have lost the zeal for   155
               your salvation, since you neglected meditation. How can you shun sin,
               since you have lost the fear of God, which is the outcome of meditation?
               You  will  fall  from  sin  into  sin,  because  after  spoiling  and  defiling  the
               grace and the religious wedding's beautiful dress, you will approach the
               angels' table impudently!
                   Thus, each Communion will be a new, grave debt to God as well as
               a new deterioration of your spirit, giving new power and right to the devfl,
               who will tempt and push you to evil » (S.'D.D.Z;).

                   (2) «The more the meditation is concentrated, the more the intellect
               knows  the  necessity  of  God's  help  and   grace  in   order to grow in
               divine love,   holy virtues,  and  sanctification,  as well  as  to understand
               the great moment of holy  perseverance.
                   The  more  the  meditation is concentrated  on  the  divine attributes,
               charity, the Passion and death of our Lord Jesus Christ, the more the
               intellect understands how much God is worthy of being loved and served
               by the people, according to the state of their life.]]></page><page Index="156"><![CDATA[When the intellect is enlightened by meditation, it moves the will to
               reach these holy goals through prayer, the will itself esteeming prayer as
               the best means. On the other hand, the prayer becomes effective when
               through  meditation  the  person  becomes  fully  aware  of  her  goals,  and
               that prayer is the best means to reach them. Hence, she will combine
               prayer with cooperation» (S.D.D.Z.).

                   (3)  As to meditation on the Passion, see chapter XXIII.

                   (4)  Blessed   Fr.  James Cusmano   is   the founder of «Boccone
               del Povero» in Palermo.

                   (5)  «O  soul,  in  your  prayer  you  will  ask  the  Lord  for  the  spirit  of
               meditation and penance, the victory over your passions, bad inclinations,
               and the hellish enemies' snares and temptations as well. You will ask for
               grace both to escape any sin, even the lightest and the involuntary one,
               and  to  observe  your  rules  perfectly,  even  in  the  least  details.  In  your
               prayer, you will  always  ask  the  most holy  Heart  of Jesus  for  the  Holy
               Spirit  along  with  his  seven  gifts  of  intellect,      wisdom,      science,
               counsel,   piety,   strength,   and   holy fear  of God. You will long for
               these priceless gifts, imploring them with the most ardent petitions at any
               time, especially in Pentecost time. You will always ask the Lord to give
               you a new heart full of holy simplicity and purity,   remembering that you
               are a Religious nailed to the most holy cross through the three nails of   156
               chastity, obedience, and poverty. To observe these sublime virtues as
               vows,  you will  ask  the   Heart  of  Jesus'   infinite  charity    for  help    and
               detachment    from everything  and  everybody,  especially  from yourself,
               your will, opinions,  desires,    and  anxieties    not-orderly    regulated.    In
               short, you will ask him to make you as holy and perfect as he wants you
               to be, even if you never seem to be aware of being perfect. You will ask
               a profound contrition for your sins, as well as for grace to bewail them.
               You  will  also  ask  the  Lord  to  grant  you  a  love  of  the  cross;  if  Jesus
               grants you both the privilege to suffer and to like suffering, you will ask
               for  suffering,  if  such  a  wish  comes  from  God  and  not  from  your
               selfishness.  You  will  ask  such  a  gift  together  with  the  grace  of  love,
               patience, and union with His divine will. At last, because many virtues
               are implied in the spirit of sacrifice, you will ask for courage and a spirit
               of sacrifice in everything» « We must pray for all families so that the fear
               of God along with religion, good example, peace, and harmony will reign
               in them; for youths so that the Lord may preserve them in his holy fear,
               that he may bridle their passions, and bring them along the way of truth.
               Pray  for  the  propagation  of  faith  and  the  holy  childhood,  for  the
               conversion of the unfaithful, for the Catholic missions, the conversion of
               the  dissident  nations,  that  they  may  become  united  with  the  Catholic
               Church. We have to pray for the good success of the works]]></page><page Index="157"><![CDATA[in the Lord as well as for the Catholic associations and the institutions
               founded by competition, etc. (St. Paul). We have to pray that marriages
               may be celebrated in the fear of God, and their offspring grow under the
               Lord's blessing; that the religious orders progress in the holy observance
               of their holy founders' rules. We have to pray for those who commend
               themselves to our humble prayers, in which they confide sincerely.

               (7)     «  Let  us  pray  for  sailors,  especially  when the sea is stormy,  the
               winds break through, and hurricane rages.  May the Lord guide, forgive,
               and bring the sailors into the  harbor.  Let  us do the same for travelers
               who are running  risks.  In times of  divine punishment, near or far from
               us,  we  will  pray  to  appease  divine  justice,  asking  divine    mercy    to
               temper  the  punishment  for  the  spiritual   good   of all.»

               (8)   «Instead  of  being  absent-minded   during   work,   it   is   better to
               lift up our mind to God through vocal prayers in common such as saying
               the rosary and offering prayer to the Lord.»

               (9)   Novenas and triduos to obtain graces:
               In  all  occasions,  quandaries,  perils,  and  needs  we  should  resort  to
               prayer, the golden key that opens the treasure of the divine graces and
               mercies.  When  we  find  ourselves  in  such  circumstances,  usually  we
               resort to the following six novenas: to the most holy Heart of Jesus, the   157
               most holy Virgin under the most appropriate title, St. Joseph, St. Michael
               the archangel, St. Anthony of Padua, and a special prayer to all souls.
               If  we  say  two  or  three  novenas,  it  can  take  9  or  18  or  27  days,
               depending on how many of them we say daily in the morning, at noon,
               and in the evening. For an urgent grace, we may say the novena in 3
               days  by  reciting  it  3  times  a  day.  For  a  most  urgent  grace,  we  may
               complete the novena in a day by reciting it 9 times in the same day.

                                       NOVENAS
                       Saying novenas to obtain graces is a good custom.
                       When a novena is said in common with fervor, proper prayers,
               and songs as well as accompanied by exercises of holy virtues, divine
               mass, and Holy Communion it is sometimes enough to make us receive
               an important grace. If one novena is not enough, we may repeat it with
               the  same  dispositions  as  many  times  as  we  need.  Because  our  Lord
               created everything with order, weight, and measure as well as ended his
               life with marvelous order, it is suitable saying the novenas in an orderly
               way, without interruption. If we are going to say 3 novenas, we have to
               say  them  successively,  one  after  the  other.  The  importance  of  this
               regularity may be deduced from the]]></page><page Index="158"><![CDATA[30 divine Gregorian masses, whioh must be celebrated in 30 successive
               days, if we want to get our goal, according to the Church's teachers and
               doctors.

                                      PETITIONS

                       The  petitions  are an effective means  of prayer  we are  using
               since the beginning of our institution. They are written in the solemnities
               and are presented on the feast of our Lord or the most holy Virgin or the
               angels  or  the  saints  in  order  to  obtain  special  graces.  Before  being
               presented, the petition is recited in common.

                       Through such petitions we implore spiritual graces for the glory
               of God, for our own sanctification, and the good of souls as well as to
               obtain graces for a community house or for the whole order. We may
               also  add  humble  petitions  for  temporal  graces  regarding  the  spiritual
               good.
               We must begin the petition with a thanksgiving for the favors we have
               already  received,  praising,  blessing,  and  rejoicing  for  the  gifts  and
               privileges  of  the  titular  saint,  in  whose  feast  we  humbly  present  the
               petition.  Furthermore,  recognizing  that  we  are unworthy  to  receive  the
               graces, we have to ask forgiveness for our sins, and show great trust in
               our Lord Jesus Christ, the most holy Virgin, the angels, and in the saints'
               merits.                                                   158

                                        SONGS

                       To  implore  graces  for  ourselves  or  for  others,  prayer
               accompanied by songs is excellent; Because we have to praise, thank,
               and bless God, our Lord Jesus Christ, the most holy Virgin, the angels,
               and the saints, accompanying the prayer with song is beautiful.
               The music of these songs must be totally different from that of profane
               songs; it must be more or less liturgical, solemn and adapted to Latin
               words as much as possible, especially when the song is written for the

               the temple, flight into Egypt, etc. as well as to Jesus hidden, suffering,
               teaching, praying, patient, crucified, and dying. The people pray to his
               divine face, his Most Precious Blood, his most loving Heart. Other titles
               under  which  he  is  prayed  to  are:  Ecce  homo  (behold  the  man!),

               Sacrament,  exposed  on  the  throne,  passing  in  procession,  or  as  a
               viaticum through the streets; he is prayed to as enclosed and dwelling in

                       (12)  See  how  our  padre    insists    on      recommending    the
               thanks giving for the graces we have received; thanksgiving  is one  of
               his spirituality's  characteristics.

                       (14) We do not know when this letter was written and where it
               came  from,  but  we  suppose  that  it  was  mailed  from  Rome  between
               1905 and  1906. The  new  secret of holiness   is  the  devotion  under
               the  title  Sacred  Slaver  of  Love  by  St.  Louis  M.  Grignion  de  Monfort.
               Our padre seems to be saying that he has received new enlightenment   159
               on  this  devotion,  because  he  was  aware  of  it  from  the  time  he  con-
               secrated himself through this formula of his own, on June 10, 1888.

               sovereign  lady,  most  loving  Immaculate  Mary,  I  kneel  at  your  feet  in
               spite of being an unworthy son of yours; please help me to become a
               true slave of yours in order to become a true slave of Jesus.
                       My  queen,  I  am  the  prodigal  son  who  after  30  years  of
               absence, 20 of which were spent in perversion, wants to go back to his
               Father's house, not  as a son,  but  as  an  absolute slave  of soul,  body,
               thought, freedom, will, life, and death. O most holy Virgin, receive me at
               the  entrance  of  my  king's  house,  but  first,  accept  me  as  your  perfect
               slave,  in  order  that  I  may  surrender  myself  as  such  to  your  Son.  O
               beautiful queen, please grant me this grace, as you did with your servant
               De Monfort!
                       Blessed De Monfort, for the sake of this slavery, for your zeal
               in spreading it, please make me become a real slave of Jesus and Mary

               taught! Amen.»

               Virgin in  the spirit  of  the Sacred  Slavery  was made  on  Dec.  8,  1906,]]></page><page Index="160"><![CDATA[after a long, considered  preparation.  The  report was  published by  the
               magazine Queen of Hearts, the confraternity's official organ. We quote:
                       A page edifying our readers traces back to our confraternity's
               origin,  relating  in  detail  how  the  priestly  order  of  the  Evangelical
               Rogation by the Heart of Jesus and the Daughter of Divine Zeal, along
               with  their  houses,  founded  by  Canon  Di  Francia,  consecrated
               themselves to the Virgin Mary on Dec. 8, 1906. Their letter referring to
               the resolve to put the two religious orders under the special protection of
               the Queen of Hearts, was really overflowing with faith and love.
                       They  forwarded  a circular to  their  houses  and  a letter  to  us,
               petitioning  special  prayers  to  become  worthy  slaves  of  Jesus  in  Mary
               and slaves of Mary in Jesus. They said: « Here, all of us are fascinated
               and enamored of the doctrine revealed by the Blessed Monfort, apostle
               of  the  Holy  Spirit  and  the most holy Mary;  we  are  longing to  become
               slaves of the Madonna.»
                       Their orderly preparation in the houses began on Nov. 5: in 33
               consecutive  days, and  in compliance  with  the  Blessed's  counsel, they
               made the well-known practices, read, and meditated on the Treaty of the
               True Devotion and on The Secret of Mary.
                       The prayer to the Blessed Monfort that Canon Di Francia wrote
               on that occasion is worth remembering: «O glorious Blessed Louis Mary
               of Monfort, we greet you as a living flame of love and zeal for Jesus and
               Mary; we admire the divine wisdom that the Holy Spirit infused in you,
               revealing the secret of the greatest devotion to the most holy Virgin; for   160
               Jesus and Mary's sake we beseech you to help us understand such a
               celestial doctrine and grace in order to embrace it. Please pray for us
               that we may be worthy of becoming true slaves of Jesus in Mary and
               slaves of Mary for Jesus! Amen.»
                       On  the eve of the consecration,  all  of  them  kept  a strict  fast
               offering what they had saved to Jesus and his holy mother for the sacred
               slavery,  in  compliance  with  Blessed  De  Monfort's  counsel.  Their
               secretary mailed the money, asking to have it deposited at the foot of the
               Queen  of  Hearts  and  they  enclosed  the  list  of  the  persons  who
               consecrated themselves along with a report, from which we quote some
               passages:
                       The consecration  of  ourselves  as slaves  of  love  to our  Lady
               was fulfilled on the day of Immaculate Mary's feast...
                       In the Evangelical Rogation's community, the consecration was
               made  at  midnight  sharp,  the  time  when  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary's
               privileged  soul  was  created  and  infused  in  her  virgin  body;  the
               Daughters of Divine Zeal made their consecration the day after, before
               the holy mass.
                       In  both  institutes,  we  made  the  consecration  with  great
               enthusiasm]]></page><page Index="161"><![CDATA[and faith... undersigning the acts and placing them in a framework at the
               foot of the most holy Virgin, our sweetest mother and owner.
                       In  copying  out  the  names  (we  enclose  the  list  and  the  male
               community's  title),  the  Blessed  Louis  happened  to  be  the  top  list  by
               chance...  From  now  on,  he  will  be  our  special  patron!  How  much  we
               enjoyed his Treat and Secret during this month of preparation! All of us
               have been deeply impressed. These books are full of celestial fire, and
               shoot arrows burning with love for the most holy Virgin, as the Blessed
               Louis De Monfort did. For sure, he has a special place among the lovers
               of  the Madonna.  May  he help us  live  faithfully  the spirit  of  the sacred
               slavery we have embraced.
                       Isn't all this edifying? On the anniversary day, every year, they
               renew their consecration. The communities of the twin institutes renew
               the act of consecration with the same transport and fervor as if it were
               for  the  first  time.  They  make  the same  preparation,  and  celebrate  the
               same liturgy on'the eve and on the feast. After Immaculate Mary's feast,
               letters  full  of  tender  affection  for  Our  Lady  arrive  from  Messina,
               Taormina,  Oria,  Giardini,  Francavilla  Fontana,  Trani,  San  Pier  Niceto,
               etc.  They  enclosed  the  names  of  the  new consecrated along  with  the
               saving from the fast, a small but sincere tribute for the sacred slavery of
               love toward the great Mother of God. These letters give evidence that
               these institutes hold the perfect devotion to Mary in great esteem.
                       To  conclude,  we  point  out  that  both  the priests of  the Evan-
               gelical  Rogation  and  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  renew  their  con-  161
               secration of the sacred slavery to the child Jesus, supreme goodness,
               with a charming formula, on Christmas.

                       (16) The  consecration  of the  institute to  the  most holy Virgin
               was  made  on  Dec.  8,  1906,  and  was  preceded  by  the  personal  con
               secration,  or  better,  by  the  renovation  of  the  consecration  our  padre
               made in Rome on   May 13,  1906,  in  the  sanctuary of  Mary  Queen
               of  Hearts,  held  by  the  Monfort's  priests.  Our  padre  premised  a  triduo
               of  holy  masses,  making  the  consecration  on  the  fourth  day.  Fr.  Boni-
               celli  wrote:    «We  feel  that  we  can    stiH  see  him  going  to  the  front
               of  the  sanctuary  after  the  celebration,  making  the  solemn  act,  and
               praying  with  opened  arms  to  the  Beautiful  Queen,  as  he  called  the
               Madonna.  Then,  he  went  out  fully  happy  for  having  strengthened  his
               bonds  on  the  day  dedicated  to  the    most  holy  Mary's  humility,  on
               May  13,  according  to  our order's  calendar.»  The  meditations  of  those
               days on the sacred slavery are abbreviated in these brief notes.

                   (17)  In  those  times,  the  feast  was  celebrated  on  the  third  Wed
               nesday  after  Easter  as  a  first  class  feast  with  an  octave.  Pius  Xil
               replaced it with the feast of St. Joseph the worker, on May first.]]></page><page Index="162"><![CDATA[(18)  Let  us  remember  this  pious  industry,  which  is  one  of  our
               padre's  characteristics.  «  He  wanted  to  create  for  himself  a  celestial
               court  of  saints  who  would  take  special  care  of  our  orders.  He  chose
               those  saints  who  in  their  mortal  life  showed  a  most  fervent  zeal  for
               winning  good  workers  for  the Lord to serve in his  harvest,  as  well  as
               those whose institutions are similar to the Anthonian ones. He believed
               that these saints continue praying to our Lord for evangelical workers,
               for  their  institutions,  and  for  the  faithful  who  follow  their  pattern.
               Therefore, he wished to challenge them through special prayers in order
               that they might consider themselves Celestial Rogationists or Daughters
               of  Divine  Zeal.  He  proclaimed  them  as  such  with  specific  petitions,
               calling to mind what they did on earth to spread charitable works as well
               as  the  command  of  the  Rogate»  (Vitale,  Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di

                       LOVE OF CHILDREN AND OF THE POOR

                   As a practice of interior life, I will pay loving attention
               to  my  neighbor,  striving  hard  to  form  within  myself  a
               tender, compassionate, and understanding heart toward
               my brethren.

                   Since this pious institute is devoted to the salvation
               of  children,  through  the  means  that  holy  obedience
               allows me I will strive to commit myself to the education
               of boarders and day students, longing for their salvation,
               and asking the help of the most holy Hearts of Jesus and
               Mary to achieve it.

                   I will love and respect the poor of Jesus Christ with
               faith and charity, holding them as the suffering members
               of his mystical body, as well as being always fully aware
               of  how  Jesus  Christ  exalted  them  by  declaring  that
               whatsoever is done for the poor, is done to himself.      163

                   I  regret  that  the  Ignorant,  lost  world  rejects  and
               scorns  the  poor,  just  as  many  Christians  often  do.  I,
               however, will lead the poor to follow the paths of eternal
               salvation, and will hold them as great people, as princes
               before God, according to the Psalm's saying, « their lives
               will be precious in His sight » (Ps. 72, 14). Even though
               they may be troublesome, I will be sympathetic by aiding
               them, and helping them as much I can, and much more
               by evangelizing and drawing them to God.

                   Because our Lord Jesus Christ is supremely pleased
               by works of charity, I will be attentive and compassionate
               with the sick and the dying.

                   By observing perfectly the precept of love toward my
               neighbor;  by  loving  them  as  myself  I  will  achieve  my
               personal sanctification by this most effective means.]]></page><page Index="164"><![CDATA[THE ORPHANS

                               1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES

                    Salvation of abandoned orphans will be one of the most
               cherished  works  of  the  Rogationists  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus.
               They will provide the orphans with a sound education and an
               appropriate  profession,  with  fatherly,  loving  care,  they  will
               infuse in them principles of Christian piety, and rear them in
               the  holy  fear  of  God,  the  love  of  Jesus  and  Mary,  and
               reception  of  the  holy  sacraments.  Finding  proper  ways  to
               make  them  feel  secure  dear  and  joyous,  they  will  provide
               them with the things they need, especially when they are sick,
               regarding  the  last  of  the  orphans as  the  first  of  the  fathers.
               When  the  orphans  are  ready  to  leave  the  institute,  the
               Rogationists will endeavor to provide them with honest work,
               and  watch  over  them  so  that  they  may  persevere  in  the
               practice of Christian principles (C.R.).

                    Religion is the foundation of a good education, and work
               is the most effective factor of good discipline, far it forms the   164
               chief  component  of  the  orphanage's  subsistence;  neatness
               and hygiene are observed in detail (Rules for orphanage for
               girls).

                    Appropriate  rules  that  follow  from  our  educational
               system will be read day by day to the girls as the basis for
               their  good  behavior  during  their  educational  training.  The
               superiors will demand observance of the rules.

                    Both  the mother  superior  and  the  teacher  will  see  to  it
               that  the  community  of  the  orphans  proceeds  with  perfect
               discipline  and  order,  following  the  schedule  of  sound
               principles, as well as the seasonal changes. The chiming of
               the bell will be the time-signal, and they wild correspond to it
               quickly and exactly (S.D.D.Z.).]]></page><page Index="165"><![CDATA[I  have  received  your  printed  paper  of  Dec.  25,  1920,
               through which you have asked my opinion on the Pious Hotel
               Trivulzio  of  Milan  and  on  the  Council  of  the  Orphanages'
               proposal to dismiss the male orphans from the institute at the
               age of 12-15, entrusting them to their mother or to a guardian;
               such  a  proposal  foresees  a  vocational  scholarship  for  the
               12-14 year old orphans and a work scholarship for those of
               15 years of age.

                    If the children's education is satisfactory under the civil
               and  religious  point  of  view  (I  suppose  they  have  arts  and
               crafts), I am absolutely against such a proposal, because the
               youths at 18 are well trained and capable of being successful
               in civil life. On the contrary, delivering them to their mother or
               to a guardian at the age of 12 makes their education come to
               nothing, generally speaking.

                    The  orphaned  boys  who  leave  my  institute  when  they
               have reached legal age, are so well trained in education and
               profession that they earn their living honestly. The chief point
               is  basing  education  on  sound  civil  and  religious  principles,   165
               which must be respectful of Gad, his holy law, and civil and
               ecclesiastical authorities.

                    Of  great  importance  is  the  watching  over  the  children,
               and  counseling  them  against  moral  harm,  because  if  mis-
               conduct is allowed, the orphanage cannot stand, everything
               goes  to  ruin,  and  the  children  become  languid,  and
               insensitive to education. Should be this the case, it would be
               better to entrust them to a guardian. Everything depends on
               the educators; they must not be the ones who are willing to
               eliminate  all  the  educational  systems,  the  lay  one  excepted
               (From  «  The  Orphanage  »,  bimonthly  paper  of  Milan,  Aug.
               14-15, 1921).

                    Please  train  the  orphans  in  discipline  and  work,  since
               they are children. Later, they will be happy for that. Beginning
               from their tender age, they must be taught to]]></page><page Index="166"><![CDATA[comply  with  their  duty  toward  God,  themselves,  and  their
               neighbor; by so doing, they are setting out on the right path
               toward their eternal salvation. Everything passes away, bun
               since  the  human  being  was  created  to  be  eternal,  each
               Christian must always keep in mind his last goal, which is his
               eternal salvation (1) (Rules for orphans, 1890) .


                       2. SISTERS COMMITTED TO EDUCATION

                    I make every effort to achieve the goal which is proper to
               any  educational  institute,  that  of  providing  its  subjects  with
               good success.

                    I am fully aware of my duty and responsibility. Gathering
               persons,  feeding  them,  and  leaving  them  merely  to  exist  is
               not  the  educational  institution's  aim,  for  it  does  not  change
               the abandoned orphans' fortune nor does it prepare a good
               future  far  them.  Education  aims  at  regenerating  and
               moralizing the persons who are rooted out of vagabondage,
               enabling them to earn their living honestly.              166

                    The  serious  task  of  educating  and  teaching  so  many
               orphans  compelled  me  to  seek  out  and  to  form  good
               educators.  I  first  applied  to  two  communities  of  sisters,
               because  no  secular  teacher  may  compete  with  them  in
               education; in fact, the nun is born of religion to be a mother, a
               teacher, a friend, and a sister of the youth of whatever rank. A
               sister,  being  educator  and  mother  of  the  youth,  represents
               one of the finest missions of Christianity, especially in the last
               two centuries.

                    From the time I began gathering the female orphans I felt
               myself in need of educators, but the Daughters of Charity and
               the Daughters of St. Anne, to whom I had applied, rejected
               my request, for I was unable to reward]]></page><page Index="167"><![CDATA[their work. Then a too daring idea crossed my mind: the idea
               of  farming  a  community  of  nuns  who  should  dedicate
               themselves to my orphan's education.

                    It  is  hard  believing  now  arduous  such  enterprises  are.
               Where could I find youths suitable to such a mission? A few
               persons in Messina think that I formed the community of the
               sisters by selecting some youths from the orphans. But they
               are  mistaken...  young  women,  willing  to  consecrate
               themselves to God and charity came here from other towns
               on purpose. They were not orphans; mast of them had and
               have  parents  alive,  but  they  left  family  and  native  towns  to
               devote  themselves  to  the  poor  abandoned  orphans'
               education and service. They know their own mission: I myself
               educated  them  to  such  a  school,  a  school  of  charity  and
               sacrifice.

                    I  am  fully  aware  of  the  caustic  criticism  of  this  hard
               enterprise  of  forming  a  community  of  sisters  who  commit
               themselves to the orphans' salvation. To tell the truth, if there
               had been no critique, it would have been a marvel! Unluckily,   167
               the saying that no one can be a prophet in his own homeland
               is really true; I, however, feared the critique of the future mare
               than  that  of  the  present.  What  I  really  feared  was  that  my
               orphanage  could  come  to  nothing  after  my  death;  then
               censure could rightly blame my memory for not having made
               a lasting shelter of salvation for these poor orphans.

                    This charitable institute's continuity has been ruling my
               thoughts ever since. It has been the main object of my efforts,
               but to reach this vital goal I needed to form a community of
               sisters.  From  the  time  I  failed  to  engage  the  Daughters  of
               Charity and the, Daughters of St. Anne, I conceived the idea
               of founding the Daughters of Divine Zeal.

                    Oh! If those who once censured me knew the stormy]]></page><page Index="168"><![CDATA[events I passed through in order to found this congregation of
               sisters  as  well  as  haw  I  froze  and  sweated while  gathering
               orphans from the city and its surroundings! What a hard task
               it was to educate so many orphans and form their educators
               and teachers at the same time! (Speech, Aug. 20, 1906).


                                   3. OUR MISSION

                    Now our talk is about the orphanages, which represent
               our  mission  of  gathering  scattered,  poor,  abandoned,
               orphaned  children  in  order  to  save  them  spiritually  and
               materially. We pursue this aim by delivering the orphans from
               abandonment,  depravity  of  the  world,  hunger,  misery,
               idleness, scandals, risks, and temporal and eternal ruin!

                    Haw much the mast holy Heart of Jesus delights in this
               work for the abandoned orphans' salvation! What a conquest
               of souls is snatching them from the devil and bringing them to
               God!
                                                                         168
                    Rescuing  an  orphan  from  a  deadly  future  along  with
               providing  him  a  spiritual  and  temporal  well-being  is  such  a
               redemption that it does not end with the individual orphan, but
               continues  from  generation  to  generation,  bringing  about
               innumerable goods!

                    A  male  and  a  female  educated  orphan  who  succeeds,
               will convey their education and morals in the midst of society
               through  their  example  as  well  as  by  becoming  parents  of
               children, with whom they will share the teaching of faith and
               civilization, practice of piety and training they received in the
               pious institute, where they grew up for God and their happy
               future.

                    Those  who  strive  diligently  for  the  salvation  of  tender
               children,  in  wham  they  awaken  the  smile  of  love;  who
               eliminate tears and desperation, deserve a great reward.]]></page><page Index="169"><![CDATA[We would say that no work is so appreciated and pleasing to
               the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  as  the  education  of  little
               children. In this case, our Lord will not cry out with uttermost
               anguish the utterance of the Holy Scripture, « What do you
               gain by my blood? » (Ps. 30, 9) as he does at sight of the
               frightful abuse the world commits against childish souls and
               at sight of their unhappy life or eternal loss. On the contrary,
               at  sight  of  the  holiest  mission  aiming  at  saving  the
               abandoned,  derelict  orphans  as  well  as  at  sight  of  its  good
               results, our Lord Jesus Christ will exclaim: What a gain by my
               blood! These and the future souls are brought to my Heart by
               my faithful ministers and my faithful spouses! Blessed be the
               blood I shed in the midst of terrible suffering for the salvation
               of souls!

                    Everyone knows how much the child Jesus suffered for
               the babies the impious Herod slaughtered when Joseph and
               Mary  took  him  to  Egypt.  He  saw  those  babies  slaughtered
               and  drowned  in  their  blood,  felt  their poor mothers'  torment
               and  cries  in  his  most  sensitive  Heart.  He  experienced  that
               horrible scene as if it were the occurring in his sweetest Heart   169
               as well as the sword points and the sabre cuts piercing his
               own Heart! And yet, he was consoled by the thought that the
               babies who were slaughtered in his place would be glorified
               in heaven.

                    But  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  suffered  even  more
               when he foresaw the numberless tender souls, who deprived
               of parents and of an opportunity to be educated to a good life
               by  zealous  persons,  would  be  left  open  to  the  spiritual
               slaughter which is caused by sin.

                    This  unheard  slaughter  has  happened  millions  and
               millions of times ever since the world began! My daughters in
               Jesus Christ, if you took care of yourselves only, you would
               run the risk of eternal loss. Let us not hold our]]></page><page Index="170"><![CDATA[own soul more precious than the souls of our brothers (Act.
               20,  24).  Let  us  take  the  utmost  care  of  the  abandoned
               orphans. But because this involves the education of childish,
               young  souls,  we  must  expand  our  zeal  not  only  to  the
               abandoned orphans, but also to the tender, young souls who
               come  into  our  ministry,  whether  those  in  the  kindergarten,
               those  in  day-schools,  or  those  in  the  orphanages.  These
               institutions  are  concerned  with  the  salvation  of  present  and
               future souls, pleasing the most holy Heart of Jesus just as the
               orphanages do.

                    Let us conclude by considering how great and immense
               is the priceless reward that our Lord Jesus Christ will give the
               lovely  brides  who  are  completely  committed  to  this  holy
               mission. They will be rewarded during their life, at death, and
               after-death,  because  their  mission  rejoice  forever  the  most
               holy Heart of Jesus, the holy Church on earth, the heavenly
               court  in  paradise,  the  angels,  the  saints,  and  especially  the
               great mother Mary. (S.D.D.Z.).

                                                                         170
                             4. TAKING CARE Of HEALTH

                    Usually,  the  orphans  must  be  taken  away  from  their
               abandonment and poverty without exacting monthly tuition; it
               would be a serious fault if the poor orphans were not received
               for lack of funds. But the person who called our attention to
               them or the intimate relatives can be asked for the bed and
               accessories as well as for some clothes and a little frock, etc.
               If  they  cannot  afford  to  pay  for  them,  either  they  or  the
               institute  may  arrange  a  collection.  At  last,  whatever  the
               results may be, the orphan must be received in the name of
               God, whose creature the orphan is.

                    In dealing with the children, the sisters will teach]]></page><page Index="171"><![CDATA[them  hygiene  and  cleanness,  both  of  which  confer  and
               preserve  their  health,  while  the  lack  of  hygienic  habits
               deteriorate  both  their  oven  health  and  endanger  that  of
               others.  By  receiving  the  orphans,  the  sisters  are  bound  in
               duty not only to educate them procuring their spiritual good,
               but  also  to  keep,  preserve,  and  improve  their  bodily
               well-being.

                    To protect the girls' health, the following items must be
               taken into consideration:
                    a.  The  institute's  topography,  which  must  be  airy  and
               sunny, having gardens without humidity.

                    b. The diet will be sound, avoiding both the insufficiency
               of food and the overabundance of it. The amount of food is to
               be  gradual  and  proportionate  to  the  child's age,  remarkably
               increasing for those of about 13 years. Food is to be natural
               and without complicated sauces or the like. The children will
               become accustomed to the community food.

                    The  sisters  will  spay  diligent  attention  to  the  child's   171
               complexion, knowing that a pallid complexion and the lack of
               interest  in  play  activity  are  symptoms  of  illness,  fever  or
               indigestion; in such a case a remedy must be applied.

                    The faucet lavatory must be suitable to the children. As
               to the baths, they must be used with discretion.

                    c. Lively, animated sport in the open air is conducive to
               good  health;  in  case  of  inclement  weather,  the  children  will
               play under cover, and the windows will be well, regulated for
               good ventilation and temperature.

                    d.  Air  must  be  always  pure;  the  dormitories  having
               proportionate  air-holes  on  the  tap  and  the  bottom  must  be
               airy  and  sunny  with  their  windows  open  all  day  long,  but
               closed at dusk. The beds wilt be at a distance of about a yard
               from each other; the windows will be high, and]]></page><page Index="172"><![CDATA[some of them open enough to make air circulate in the night.
               Besides,  the  dormitories  must  be  well  ventilated,  because
               fresh  air  is  a  major  factor  in  maintaining  the  health  of  the
               children. As long as the lungs breathe pure air, children will
               be always healthy.

                    In the regions where climate is hot, the people sleep with
               open windows even in the night.

                    Children are more susceptible to colds in the hot and in
               the  middle  season  more  than  in  winter.  Usually  it  happens
               because  they  expose  themselves  to  currents  of  air,  when
               over heated and perspiring. This causes the pores to close.
               As  a  result  they  are  afflicted  with  inflammation,  cold,  and
               catarrh.  To avoid  these  inconveniences,  appropriate  care  is
               needed. Specifically, windows and balconies will be closed on
               the  windy  days,  and  to  provide  air  circulation  they  will  be
               opened only for an adequate time when the community is out.
               Special  care  will  be  taken  to  avoid  the  ebb  and  flow  of  air
               when children pass through the corridors.
                                                                         172
                    A  sister  will  keep  watch  in  the  dormitory  at  night,
               preventing the children from becoming chilled when they get
               up from the warm bed when the air is cold. Catching a cold
               and  catarrh  at  their  age  is  dangerous,  since  it  can  last  for
               years, sometimes turning into phthisis.

                    Do not accustom the children to wear woolen or heavy
               clothes,   because   somehow   enduring   cold   weather
               strengthens  their  health.  As  to  the  coverlets,  the  sister  will
               provide  for  the  children  adequate  coverlets  as  the  cold
               season approaches (S.D.D.Z.).


                              5. RELIGIOUS EDUCATION

                    If  attentive  and motherly  care  of  the  orphans'  health  is
               important, more important is their education in religious]]></page><page Index="173"><![CDATA[principles, which must be the basis of their education and of
               their temporal and eternal happiness.

                    On arrival, the teacher will present the child to the Holy
               Sacrament  and  to  the  most  holy  Virgin,  praying  them  to
               receive that child under their protection. The teacher will also
               encourage the little girl to say some «Hail Marys» and make a
               little offering, while she, herself, will pray interiorly for the soul
               that the Lord is entrusting to her.

                    When the child experiences the loneliness of separation
               from  her  relatives,  the  teacher  will  maternally  console  and
               comfort her and cheer her at time with candy or some other
               treat. The child will forget her loneliness if she is encouraged
               to join the other children in their play activities.

                    After  giving  the  main  rules  for  the  children's  bodily
               health, of which we take responsible care, now we are going
               to  deal  with  a  more  important  topic:  the  children's  spiritual
               education (S.D.D.Z.).
                                                                         173
                    Thirty  years  ago  I  began  gathering,  educating,  and
               providing orphans with a good future; ever since I have been
               holding  and  experiencing  that  the  steady  base  of  any  civil
               education  is  religious  education!  I  have  learned  from
               experience,  reason,  faith,  learned  people,  and  common
               sense:  that  to  form  a  civil  human  being,  an  educated  good
               citizen, it is necessary to form a good Christian!

                    If we educate the youths' mind about the knowable, we
               must  also  educate  their  mind  about  the  Catholic  faith's
               supreme  principles.  If  we  exercise  the  children  in  arts  and
               crafts, we must also exercise them in prayer, lifting up their
               mind to the purest region of light, where no distinction exists
               between ranks and social conditions, but it does between the
               virtues and merits of a Christian life.]]></page><page Index="174"><![CDATA[Today, society is about to crumble, because the religious
               base has been shaken, either in the education of the heart or
               in  the  training  of  the  mind!  Generally  speaking,  school  has
               become an environment of seduction, deceit, and depravity,
               especially  in  the  cities.  Youth  are  entrusted  to  atheistic
               teachers  developing  in  tender  hearts  hatred  and  revolt
               against  ecclesiastical  authority.  You  are  witnesses  of  haw
               young  people  finish  school  poisoned  by  false  teaching  and
               historical lies, how they lack respect for priests, scorn religion,
               and prepare unhappy days for themselves, their family, and
               for society.

                    If we look at the education of common people, we realize
               that  the  consequences  of  an  atheistic  education  are  even
               more pernicious. The unrest among the working class shows
               it.  The  continuous  strikes,  revolts  against  civil  authorities,
               hatred, crimes, and so many other evils give evidence of the
               threat to the social order (2) (Speech, Jan. 31, 1909).

                    Even  though  little  orphaned  children  do  not  yet  attend
               the elementary schools, they must be educated in Christian   174
               doctrine  from  their  tender  age,  beginning  with  the  first
               elements. The younger ones will be taught orally, the others
               will use the catechism booklets. The chief aim is to educate
               the  children's  mind  by  appropriate  explanations,  tales,  and
               biblical  stories,  avoiding  to  teach  the  elements  of  faith
               mechanically.

                    The  yearly  feasts,  especially  those  of  our  Lord  Jesus
               Christ and the most holy Virgin, will be profitable means for
               the sisters to help children lift up their mind and heart to the
               knowledge of the adorable Jesus Christ. For instance, during
               the holy week they will inspire a holy fear of God and a great
               compassion for the crucified Jesus and his mother's sorrows,
               infusing  the  sacred  melancholy  of  the  holy  days  in  their
               tender souls. On]]></page><page Index="175"><![CDATA[Easter, they will inspire the children with holy joy for our Lord
               Jesus Christ's resurrection... The liturgical year's solemnities
               can be rich in teachable moments.

                    To  teach  Christian  doctrine  mechanically  to  children  is
               nearly useless. To better impress the mysteries of faith in the
               children's tender minds, they will vary the instruction through
               careful  wording  of  the  catechism  and  the  use  of  lecture,
               projecting  pictures  from  s4ides  and  explaining  the  truths  of
               faith.  Teaching  Christian  doctrine  to  the  orphans  will  be  a
               matter  of  great  concern  for  the  sisters,  who  will  devote
               themselves  to  it  in  order  to  develop  the  spiritual  life  of  the
               orphans.

                    To facilitate attaining this goal and to win the enthusiastic
               cooperation  of  the  children  in  learning  Christian  doctrine, at
               the end of the year the sisters will invite some priests to the
               exams; they will also use appropriate attractions in order to
               allure children to a deep interest in important learning... A day
               of  celebration  for  the  top  list  children,  as  well  as  other
               profitable activities and awards, for effective teaching will be   175
               rewarding without stimulating the children's pride (S.D.D.Z.).
               (3)

                    The  orphans  will  be  diligent  in  complying  with  their
               religious duties, being pious and at home with God; otherwise
               they will be unable to accomplish any good. After arising and
               saying some prayers, they will do a brief meditation and then
               attend the holy mass; they will also say the rosary and read a
               spiritual  book  for  a  while.  At  night,  they  will  examine  their
               conscience. Every Friday, they will say a special prayer to the
               most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  to  whom  they  are  consecrated
               under the title of Little Poor of the Heart of Jesus. They will go
               to confession once a week, following the confessor's counsel
               for receiving Communion.

                   Vocal prayer must be paced in a moderate and calm]]></page><page Index="176"><![CDATA[voice, with exact pronunciation, and devotion. Children must
               be  exhorted  to  receive  the  most  Holy  Communion  with
               profound  devotion  and  recollection,  making  an  appropriate
               preparation and thanksgiving. Any action in common, such as
               study, work, school, and eating will be preceded and followed
               by a brief prayer.

                    On Sundays and feasts, the schedule will allow for more
               play-time,  and  also  more  prayer  and  spiritual  reading.  The
               orphans  will  share  in  a  day  of  spiritual  recollection  every
               month and in a three day spiritual retreat every year.

                    The pious union of the Luigini Sons of Immaculate Mary
               was created to increase faith and piety; the orphans whose
               behavior merits it, will be awarded the prize of being admitted
               to  the  union.  They  will be religious  not only  in  the  external,
               practice  of  their  duties,  but  also  in  their  inner  spiritual  life,
               always  having  the  holy  fear  of  God,  the  surest  guide  to
               success (R.P.A.).

                                                                         176
                              6. EDUCATIONAL RULES

                    To  aid  us  in  fulfilling  our  great  mission  of  helping  the
               orphans  to  develop  good,  pious,  and  holy  characters,  we
               indicate some of the specific rules and manners.

                    1. Good example. (4) The sisters and the assistants will
               endeavor to radiate observance, piety, zeal, charity, union of
               hearts, and holy fervor as examples of virtues and holiness
               for  the  edification  of  the  orphans.  The  sisters'  action  more
               than the words must penetrate and edify the tender souls! As
               little  as  they  may  be,  children  have  a  natural  power  of
               perceiving  by  intuition  the  goodness  inherent  in  their
               superiors'  behavior.  If  their  examples  are  bad  -  which  God
               forbid! - the children by]]></page><page Index="177"><![CDATA[intuition  will  form  their  own  judgments  and scorn  what  they
               have  been  taught.  As  sound  as  may  be  the  teachings  by
               words,  in  the  presence  of  actions  contradictory  to  the
               teachings, they fade away like smoke under the wind's force.

                    For instance, a sister making the sign of the cross before
               little children in a careless or irreverent manner is implying to
               them that the sign of the cross is unimportant. She may be
               unaware  of  the  impression  she  is  creating.  A  sister  or
               assistant  who  in  the  presence  of  even  three  years  old
               children, speaks to the superior disrespectfully, diminishes for
               them the principle of divine authority, which is shared by the
               people who are in a position of superior. A sister or assistant
               eating  or  drinking  greedily  in  the  presence  of  children,
               teaches them gluttony in a masterly manner.

                    We  could  give  many  examples  which  seem  trifles,  but
               which have the power to waste he orphaned children's souls
               because  their  pure,  tender  minds  are  able  to  feel  in  the
               innermost the bad qualities that a teacher nurtures tacitly or
               temporarily. For instance, if a sister or assistant is troubled by   177
               a voluntary grudge against another, she is unable to conceal
               it. Even the least perceptive child perceives it as though he
               were penetrated by a magnetic influx.

                    In the world, the ruin of souls which occurs in families is
               a hecatomb. Education in the world has been defined: « The
               most difficult art entrusted to the most inexperienced hands. »
               People act, talk, and speak in the presence of  children as if
               they do not understand what has been said or done. On the
               contrary,  children  understand  very  much,  even  if  they  are
               unaware  of  it;  in  fact,  babies  learn  to  speak  a  language  at
               about the age of two years.]]></page><page Index="178"><![CDATA[It was well stated by St. John Chrisostom: « Education of
               children  is  the  art  of  the  arts;  no  human  art,  painting  and
               sculpture included, can reach the merits of those forming the
               children's  soul.  »  To  well  know  the  art  of  education,  one
               should be a theologian, and a philosopher and a saint.

                    And yet, those who left the world to dedicate themselves
               to God in religion, seeking their sanctification, are able to lead
               the tender souls toward a sound, moral, and civil education if
               they  are  helped  by  divine  assistance  and  keep  in  mind  the
               importance  of  education,  rules,  and  these  exhortations.  But
               such education must begin with the perfect example that the
               sisters  must  be  to  the  children,  since  they  are  called  and
               committed to the sublime mission of education (S.D.D.Z.). (5)

                    2. Prayer. Because everything starts well with God, the
               sisters  who  are  committed  to  the  orphan's  direction,
               education,  and  service  will  combine  good  example  with
               prayer in order to educate them in a holy manner. Separately
               from  the  orphans,  (6)  they  will  pray  in  common  at  the
               assigned time every day with zeal and fervor so that our Lord   178
               and the most holy Virgin may give them enlightenment in the
               performance of their duty toward the orphans; and to give the
               orphans  docility  and  grace  to  cooperate  faithfully  with  the
               sisters' instruction, direction, and motherly kindness.

                    3. Surveillance. Continuous, accurate surveillance is an
               important  factor  to  keep  the  institute's  orphans  in  perfect
               order. Watching over them is the master's, the vice-master's,
               and the assistant's duty, but the major responsibility is that of
               the master. Continuous, accurate, and careful surveillance is
               the great preservative from any defect, hence it is called the
               preventive method. From]]></page><page Index="179"><![CDATA[the  sisters'  watchful  care  the  orphans  understand  the
               importance  and  the  aim  of  surveillance,  and  they  learn  to
               accustom  themselves  to  discipline  and  the  practice  of  their
               duties.

                    The  master,  either  personally  or  through  the  vice-
               master,  who  should  be  fully  aware  of  his  high  mission  and
               responsibility,  will  never  leave  children  abandoned  to
               themselves,  otherwise  they  quickly  and  inevitably  become
               negligent and inactive. The sister who oversees the orphans
               must  keep  close  vigilance  over  them,  aware  of  all  their
               actions and conversations.

                    Most watchful will be surveillance during play-time. The
               sister  will  be  most  alert  as  she  leads  the  children  to  the
               recreational  area  annexed  to  the  institute  where  their  play
               activity will allow them to let off steam; all of which improves
               their  health,  as  well  as  their  physical  and  emotional
               development.  In  their  play  she  will  be  attentive  to  prevent
               rough  and  rowdy  actions,  which  could  result  in  harmful
               injuries.  In  order  that  good  habits  in  working  and  playing   179
               together  be  developed,  quarreling  and  poor  sportsmanship
               will not be tolerated. No one should separate them from the
               group, either alone or in pairs, but all should be within sight of
               the person presiding. (7)

                    4.  Holy  suggestions.  Both  superior  and  teachers  will
               endeavor to instill in the children faith in divine things, love for
               Jesus  and  Mary,  and  the  angels  and  saint.  By  speaking  to
               them of God, of Jesus' love for them, his Passion and death,
               as well as of the most holy Virgin's suffering at the foot of the
               cross, they will affect them strongly with holy thoughts.

                    The  sisters  will  bear  in  mind  that  a  pure,  virginal,
               childlike mind learns readily the most holy, sublime truths that
               are  communicated  to  them  in  a  simple,  easy  way.  The
               marvels of creation such as the sun, the moon, the]]></page><page Index="180"><![CDATA[stars, the fine days of spring, the field, the trees, the flowers,
               the food they eat, the water they drink are topics to be talked
               about  frequently.  The  sisters  will  make  children  understand
               that all things are the work of God and everything has been
               created  for  our  good.  By  showing  them  holy  images  and
               much more with edifying stories the sisters will often talk to
               them of Jesus as our Savior.

                    To succeed in everything, the sisters first must be deeply
               convinced  of  the  holy  truths;  they  must  be  spiritual  souls
               giving holy examples.

                    5.  Loving  manners.  For  Gads  sake,  both  superior  and
               teachers  will  be  affectionate  and  respectful  toward  the
               orphaned children, holding them as souls who are dearest to
               the Lord, perhaps dearer than themselves, because they are
               innocent and poor. In their affectionate care of the orphans,
               the sisters will never make use of offensive or harsh words,
               especially  when  dealing  with  those  marked  by  anger  anal
               impatience,  not  even  when  it  is  a  matter  of  correcting,
               reproaching, or punishing them.                           180

                    That  the  orphans  may  develop  the  same  virtues,  the
               sisters' relationship with them must be marked by meekness,
               charity,  and  holy  zeal  as  well  as  by  a  pinch  of  sternness,
               which will prevent the children from taking advantage of them
               or becoming excessively familiar. The sisters will beware  of
               partiality, because it can be detrimental for all: instead they
               will love all in God dealing prudently with all in order to avoid
               the  orphans'  taking  advantage.  Such  treatment  does  not
               prevent them from rewarding the best, humble, obedient, and
               observant children. But the sisters will not kiss even the least
               one  of  them,  nor  will  they  permit  themselves  to  be  kissed
               (S.D.D.Z.).]]></page><page Index="181"><![CDATA[7. PARTICULAR RULES

                    1.  We  know  by  experience  that  a  day  of  walking  from
               early in the morning and in good weather improves effectively
               the  children's  health.  However  they  should not  return  home
               later than dusk. After hearing mass they may go out to walk
               by  tramway  or by  coach,  if  the place  is  far-off;  at  least  two
               sisters will accompany theses and see that the orphans eat
               good food, and enjoy themselves all day long.

                    The community of the orphans will seldom walk through
               the  public  streets  of  the  city,  even  though  it  is  sometimes
               useful  because  the  orphans'  walking  recollected  and  well
               behaved  moves  those  who  see  them  to  admiration  and
               compassion.

                    When the orphans are invited to share in a funeral, the
               superiors will usually decline the invitation, making exception
               for  notable  persons  who  disposed  of  the  bequest  in  the
               orphans' favor, or for those people who have donated a good
               amount  of  money  as  recompense.  To  decline  the  invitation   181
               the  superior  will  produce  good  reasons  such  as  these:  the
               orphans cannot afford to lose the profit of their work nor their
               time;  dressing  and  resuming  the  working  clothes  is
               troublesome; the risk of catching a cold in winter time or in
               hot days, etc. If they accept the invitation, both superior and
               master will see to it that the orphans are dressed neatly and
               behave with propriety in public.

                    2. The orphans will have no relationship with outsiders,
               and no stranger is allowed to approach them. A watchful care
               must  be  taken  especially  when  masters  or  farmers  or  such
               persons  are  working  in  the  institute.  Any  approach  by
               outsiders may happen to be dangerous.]]></page><page Index="182"><![CDATA[3.  If  children  have  parents  or  grand-parents  or  ben-
               efactors, they will write to them on the main feast, their patron
               saint's day, as well as any time they receive mail from them.
               When parents or relatives come to call on them, the children
               will  be  affectionate  and  respectful,  including  in  their
               conversion  such  things  as  to  draw  them  near  the  Lord.
               Besides  feasts  and  the  like,  the  visit  day  will  be  twice  a
               month, and the sister will assist the children (S.D.D.Z.).

                    4. Accompanied by a supervisor, the boys can see their
               parents  or  relatives  every  Sunday,  always  behaving
               respectfully  and  politely.  Before  letting  the  boys  go  to  the
               parlor, the prefect must be sure that the visitors are parents
               or relatives, excluding any strangers or the female cousins of
               the same age. The same is true for the young girls. He will be
               present  at  their  talk,  moderating  them  through  appropriate
               words  and  considerations,  should  they  behave  improperly,
               even  if  by  ignorance.  He  will  let  the  boys  accept  what  the
               parents give them openly, but later he will search into things
               or clothes to see whether money or notes have been hidden
               (R.P.A.).                                                 182

                    5. It is above all in morals that the boys of an institute
               may become depraved. Nowadays malice is precocious, and
               many boys enter the institute after already being exposed to
               scandal in the world or in the family. When this evil enters an
               institute and spreads into it for lack of surveillance, everything
               goes to ruin: little by little all are affected by it; discipline fails,
               and  religion  does  not  matter  to  them;  dependency,  work,
               sincerity, and goad disappear; everything comes to nothing.
               Hence  the  prefect  will  take  special  care  to  prevent  such  a
               distressing evil to take root. To reach this goal:

                    a. He will see to it that the boys go to confession]]></page><page Index="183"><![CDATA[every week after making a good examination ,of conscience;
               he will send for the confessor beforehand.

                    b.  During  play-time,  he  will  be  watchful  to  prevent  the
               boys from speaking in secret, or from bunching up and hiding
               themselves in far-off ,places, or from forming an unobserved
               group of 'two or three persons. Purposely, he will close the
               door opening into the atrium, and refuse permissions which
               give the boys a chance to stay two by two unobserved.

                    c.  Prudently,  he  will  conceal  the  why  of  such  a
               surveillance, attributing it to reasonable motives.

                    d.  During  play-time,  he  will  not  allow  the  boys  to  lay
               hands on each other, paying rigorous attention to prevent the
               elder  boys  from  frolicking  with  or  caressing  the  little  ones.
               Neither will he allow the elder boys to play with the little ones.

                    e.  He  will  teach  the  boys  to  avoid  idleness  as  a  great
               enemy, keeping them occupied with good games during the
               play-time.                                                183

                    f.  When  the  prefect  receives  a  complaint  against
               someone,  he  will  question  him  tête  â  tête  with  much
               discretion,  but  without  pretending  clear  explanations;  then,
               after telling him to keep silent about the matter, he will refer
               everything to the superiors.

                    g.  He  will  encourage  the  boys  to  receive  Holy
               Communion  frequently,  because  this  is  a  great  means  that
               delivers from such an evil (R.S.A.).

                    6.  The  information  is  an  additional  effective  means  to
               keep order and discipline, as well as to prevent many evils;
               informing the superiors about a serious matter prejudicing the
               community or some of the fellows is commanded by the rules.]]></page><page Index="184"><![CDATA[The boys are driven to act stealthly by instinct, and are
               afraid  of  the  information;  hence,  they  try  to  bring  into
               disrepute  this  duty  along  with  its  beneficial  means  by
               borrowing the jargon of the world and the evil-doers, calling
               the information espionage. They do their utmost to give this
               word  an  ominous,  hated meaning  so  that  no  one  may  fulfill
               the duty of informing the superiors; to root out this duty, they
               persecute  the  follow  who  informs  the  superiors  with  their
               anger, calling him a spy; furthermore, to show this brand of
               infamy, they avoid him, do not speak to him, do an ill turn to
               him,  etc.  All  these  means  are  a  manifestation  of  the
               precocious malice that pretends impunity to bad actions.

                    For that reason, the prefect presiding over the immediate
               discipline of the boys will encourage the truth from them. He
               will  do  his  best  with  fine  manners  to  make  the  boys
               understand  that  the  duty  of  informing  is  for  the  common  or
               individual good as well as for the great benefits coming from
               it. He wild deal severely with those who try to bring the duty of
               informing the superiors into disrepute; but, while inspiring love
               and  esteem  toward  this  legitimate,  holy  duty,  on  the  other   184
               hand he will inspire reprobation for the information given on
               the ground of personal trifles or out of spite or revenge. He
               will point out that this is the kind of information each one must
               beware of because forgiving insults with meekness, patience,
               and  mutual  sympathy  is  better.  Likewise  he  will  teach  the
               boys  that  information  about  serious,  grave  matter  must  be
               given with no passion, personal revenge, over-statement, and
               lies, it must be given instead with an upright aim, saying the
               pure truth (R.P.A.).

                    7. Observance of silence is another important means to
               keep  good  discipline  in  the  institutes.  The  prefect  will  be  a
               solicitous guardian of this observance both in]]></page><page Index="185"><![CDATA[the times and places established by the rules. If the prefect
               wants the boys to observe silence, he will give the example
               by talking in a low voice. Nothing else helps the pupils to be
               silent as the teacher's talking in a faint voice. Even when the
               prefect is reproaching the boys who did not observe silence,
               the best means is to warn them in a low voice or by clapping
               his  hands  without  speaking;  shouting  aloud  in  these
               circumstances invites the boys to do the same (R.P.A.).


                                  8. PUNISHMENTS

                    Punishments.  When  children  are  educated  and  under
               surveillance,  they  seldom  commit  faults  which  need
               punishment, but a warning or reprehension is usually enough.
               We point out again, we must follow Don Bosco's system, the
               preventive  method,  which  wards  off  children's  faults  by
               watching  over  them  in  such  a  way  that  they  have  no
               opportunity to commit faults. Formed in a Christian spirit and
               devotion,  they  will  feel  the  holy  fear  of  God,  and  avoid   185
               committing serious faults.

                    However,  since  human  nature  is  inclined  to  evil  and
               some  people  are  bad-natured,  especially  those  born  in
               poverty, it is sometimes necessary to combine religious and
               civil  education  with  some  punishment  to  compel  them  to
               behave.  In  such  a  case  the  following  rules  are  to  be
               respected:

                    1.   Punishment   will   never   be   frequent   nor
               disproportionate  to  the  fault.  Punishments  are  like
               medicaments: if used frequently, no benefit is received from
               them, and, therefore,  people  feel  compelled  to  increase  the
               amount; but the more the medicaments are used, the less is
               their  beneficial  effect,  and  other  medicine  has  to  be
               substituted.]]></page><page Index="186"><![CDATA[An  institute  of  education  under  the  sisters'  direction  cannot
               adopt  this  course,  using  punishments  as  to  reach  such  a
               degree  that  the  pupils  become  unconcerned  with  them;
               should  it  happen,  the  institute  would  become  a  house  of
               correction, the children's community would go to ruin, and the
               spirit of the sisters who are devoted to education would come
               to an end because they would find themselves in difficulties,
               would  become  annoyed  loosing  internal  peace,  etc.;
               everything  would  be  in  disorder.  Punishments  must  be
               proportionate to the faults. When they are applied in excess,
               like  medicaments  they  harm  the  patient,  sometimes  even
               killing. Hence, the sister will never punish out of resentment,
               but when she is compelled to punish, she will act according to
               reason punishing less than it is due.

                    2. Before imposing a penalty, even a light one, the sister
               must  ask  the  Lord  for  enlightenment,  so  that  no  one  is
               mistaken.

                    3.  When  punishment  is  over,  the  child  will  go  to  the
               sister  who  inflicted  the  punishment  to  give  thanks,  beg   186
               pardon, and promise to amend. It would be also useful to tell
               the  child  to  confess  soon  if  the  fault  was  somehow  grave;
               otherwise, when the confessor comes again.
                    Material  punishments  are  to  be  used  very  seldom  and
               with  .much  discretion,  because  the  teachers'  active  sur-
               veillance,  the  good,  moral,  religious  education,  the  fine
               relationships  of  pure  holy  affection  between  teacher  and
               pupils  are  the  best  mean's  to  prevent  faults;  therefore,
               punishments should not be used. On the contrary, relaxation
               of  surveillance,  lack  of  affection,  the  teachers'  giving  bad
               examples are the cause of faults and of punishments, which
               demoralize the institute. In such a case, the sisters would be
               worthy of punishments more than the pupils.]]></page><page Index="187"><![CDATA[9. TWO MORAL PUNISHMENTS TO BE PREFERRED

                    1.  Simulated  subtraction  of  affection:  driving  back  the
               approaching  child,  showing  a  sullen  face,  and  showing  no
               love are moral punishments. When friendly relations of pure,
               holy   affection   between   teacher   and   pupils   are
               well-established,  simulated  withdrawing  of  affection  is  the
               greatest  punishment,  which  may  be  emphasized  and
               prolonged according to the faults.

                    When  a  sister  approaches  the  child  who  is  being
               punished, she may be of great assistance by helping the child
               to  reflect  upon  her  fault  and  the punishment,  and  exhorting
               her  to  go  to  the  teacher  who  imposed  the punishment.  For
               good results, it is indispensable that punishment be used very
               seldom.  Its  frequent  use  becomes  abuse;  in  fact,  the  wise
               educator strives to prevent having to punish faults.

                    2.  If  a  young  candidate  or  daughter  of  Mary  behaved
               badly,  she  could  be  threatened  with  the  removal  of  the
               blessed  medal;  should  she  persist  in  the  fault,  the  threat   187
               should  be  carried  out  for  some  days.  A  sister's  intervention
               would do the utmost to make the candidate understand her
               fault, emphasizing that the punishment the superior gave to
               her  is  greater  than  others,  and  that  a  material  punishment
               would be better. For these reasons, this punishment will be
               used very seldom.

                    We repeat over again that the religious, moral education
               as  well  as  good  example,  active  surveillance,  and  mutual,
               pure, holy affection are the best means to prevent faults and
               punishments; when they happen, however, lifting the mind to
               God  to  invoke  help  before  punishing  is  also  indispensable.
               But faults are not to be always punished, since sometimes we
               have to dissimulate or to give a benevolent interpretation to
               them.]]></page><page Index="188"><![CDATA[We give a summary of what has been said:

                      1. Prevention of the faults; we have to put children in
               the moral condition of committing no faults by giving them a
               holy,  loving  education,  good  example,  and  active,  accurate
               surveillance as well as by keeping them occupied, separated
               from outsiders, and by praying for them.

                      2.  Rare  and  moderate  punishments;  after  invoking
               divine help and seeking advice, we should use punishments
               calmly,  disposing  children  to  accept  them  reasonably  and
               lovingly.

                      3.  Pious  industries  and  strategies;  these  aim  at
               repentance and amendment.

                      4.  Exhortation  to  confess  the  faults  with  sincere
               sorrow, making steady resolutions.

                      5. An excellent step for reconciliation is exhorting the
               repented people to go to the chapel in order to ask the Lord   188
               and  the  most  holy  Virgin  for  forgiveness,  promising
               amendment.

                    The  sisters  committed  to  education must  be  convinced
               that dealing with punishments is a very delicate matter, only
               helpful  in  avoiding future  faults  when  it  is  well  handled;  but
               when faults and punishments increase because of the sister's
               faults, the punishment is harmful instead of helpful.

                    REPRIMANDS.  They  must  be  applied  with  calm  and
               good manners, otherwise they kill instead of edifying. Besides
               behaving  with  dignity,  persuading  the  people  is  also
               necessary  in  order  that  children  may  understand  and  hate
               their faults.

                    CORRECTIONS.  When  the  fault  is  private,  it  must  be
               corrected  in  private;  the  superior  or  the  teacher  may  also
               correct a public fault in private giving some punishment]]></page><page Index="189"><![CDATA[to the person at fault, when they deem it necessary to put an
               end to it (S.D.D.Z.).

                    The  prefect  will  never  reproach  nor  punish  in  public  in
               these two following cases:,

                    1.  When  he  foresees  a  reaction  from  the  boy,  which
               would cause scandal and a greater stubbornness. In such a
               case, it is better to correct and punish privately.

                    2.  When  reproaching  a  private  or  nearly  ,private  fault,
               which  might  cause  or  confirm  a  scandal  by  calling  the
               people's  attention  to  it.  Besides,  concealing  some  faults  to
               little  children  such  as  theft,  dishonesty,  or  serious
               insubordinations is sometimes better.

                    An excellent method of education that the prefect of our
               institutes  will  adopt  is  persuasion.  Either  in  the  case  of
               correction or punishment or warning, the prefect will strive to
               persuade the pupils of their fault through fatherly, but resolute
               words;  after  disproving  their  excuses,  he  will  sometimes   189
               require  their  assent,  as  for  instance  by  asking:  are  you
               persuaded of your fault? Do you agree with what I have said
               to  you?  And  the  like.  He  wild  use  persuasion  to  condition
               children  to  accept  punishment  favorably  and  profit  by  it
               (R.P.A.).


                               10. SPECIAL CAUTION

                    I  call  the  attention  of  the  sisters  who  are  committed  to
               education.  Besides  what  we  have  recommended  for  the
               success of the children, they also must use special caution to
               enhance the chance of success for a child, even though she
               is the least one, and to avoid an irretrievable blow. We look at
               it.

                    A child sometimes happens to oppose the teacher's will
               by instinct, without being fully aware of it. In such]]></page><page Index="190"><![CDATA[a  case  it  is  the  teacher's  will  that  must  prevail.  She  must
               tactfully  move  the  child's  will  to  her  own  in  a  way  quite
               unknown  to  the  child.  The  teacher  will  be  delicate  in  using
               holy,  loving  dynamics,  also  adding  prayer  because  without
               divine help not even a child's will may be subdued. In other
               terms, the teacher will pretend that the child's behavior is not
               stubbornness. But, let us come to the point that could harm
               the innocent soul.

                    Suppose  that  a  child  is  at  fault  against  the  teacher's
               orders in various little things; for instance, the child is restless
               during the work and the mother superior is acquainted with it.
               Suppose that the mother superior goes to the children, asks
               the teacher how they behave and the teacher answers: « All
               is  well.  »  If  the  superior  says,  «  I  know  that  this  child  is
               restless at work, gets up, goes away, etc., » the teacher has
               to speak wisely and well of the child by saying: « It is true, but
               not always; it sometimes happens because the child does not
               feel  well;  however,  she  is  amending  and  is  going  to  work
               calmly  and  willingly  as  the  others  do  or  even  better.  »  The
               mother superior will conclude: « I am sure of that; this child   190
               will perhaps surpass the others. »

                      But,  if  the  teacher  says:  «  Ah,  my  dear  superior!  This
               child acts on her own account and will; I do not know what to
               do any longer, because I am unable to correct her; she does
               not listen, therefore I cannot deal with, etc... » she would be a
               fool and would harm that child.

                    Should  the  answer  be  this  one,  the  teacher  would  not
               only be yielding to the child but would be also showing great
               imprudence, as to destroy both authority and effectiveness of
               corrections.  The  child  would  rejoice  interiorly,  because  her
               childish  will  would  prevail  over  the  teacher's  will,  but  she
               would  not  have  the  heart  to  amend,  because  she  was
               distrusted before the mother superior.]]></page><page Index="191"><![CDATA[It would be worse than ever if the teacher's declaration
               of  impotence  were addressed  to  the  children  themselves;  it
               would happen in the case of a request of the superior or to
               give  free  play,  if  the  teacher  said  before  them:  «  I  cannot
               stand  it  any  longer  because  these  children  are  bad,
               undisciplined, and do not obey; I cannot do anything because
               they do their own will, etc. » Oh! Poor children! It would be
               the same as killing them! Those children would become such
               as the incompetent, imprudent, bad teacher described them!
               Such a teacher should never act so unwisely as to ruin those
               children or she should never teach.

                    To sum up, the wise teacher will never distrust children,
               but on purpose will justify their little faults so that the children
               may  not  think  of  themselves  as  mischievous;  nor  will  the
               teacher declare impotence, but confidence. It has been wisely
               said about education of children: « You must not make them
               do, but make them want to do. »

                    When questioned about a group or class, the teacher will
               beware of saying: « All of them are restless, unbending, etc. »   191
               On  the  contrary,  the  answer  will  be  such  as  this,  «  on  the
               whole, I am glad. » Then, the teacher will shove to the mother
               superior the good qualities of the children who are doing well,
               will touch on some defects, and will add that they have goad
               will to improve. Speaking this way has an additional benefit:
               knowing that the teacher justifies children before the mother
               superior, they will become more affectionate to her.

                    It  is  obvious  that  such  delicate  methods  concern  the
               communities of little children where the educational system is
               fostered  by  the  spiritual  trend,  prayer,  reading,  practice  of
               sacraments, teaching, etc...]]></page><page Index="192"><![CDATA[11. STUDY AND WORK

                    1. The boy orphans are trained in arts and crafts, the girl
               orphans  in  feminine  works.  Both  are  trained  by  specialized
               elementary school teachers, and those favorably disposed to
               music  attend  appropriate  lessons  to  cultivate  their  talent
               (Statutes of the pious, charitable institute called « The Poor of
               the Sacred Heart of Jesus », 1890). (8)

                    Because  they  will  be  obliged  to  earn  their  living  when
               they leave the institute, the orphans need to work with love,
               attention, and in silence taking care of all tools and material
               as well as the books, paper, pens, etc. Those making special
               improvement in the work and study will be awarded (R.O.).

                    The  orphaned  girls  of  Immaculate  Mary  house  will  be
               fond  of  work  as  the  means  to  succeed  in  life,  whereas
               idleness leads to ruin; therefore, they will learn to work with
               love and diligence as a means of earning their living (R.O.).

                    The girl orphans who have been trained in the feminine   192
               works and are working for commissions will share in the profit
               of their work; their money will be registered, even though they
               may  be  unaware  of  that,  receiving  it  when  they  leave  the
               institute (Circ. Jan. 1925).

                    Both  teacher  and  vice-teacher  will  watch  over  them
               when they work or attend school, taking care that they work in
               silence.

                    As to the school, we have to resort to lay teachers only
               when it is indispensable and after praying and gaining reliable
               information, because they must be pious, modestly dressed,
               church goers, docile, and expert in teaching. At the end of the
               school  year  the  award  distribution  will  be  organized  in  a
               show, in the presence of guests (S.D.D.Z.).]]></page><page Index="193"><![CDATA[2. Let us consider the administration. What do we do to
               maintain so many persons? Where do we. get the necessary
               means?  Besides  paying  the  rent  for  the  boys'  institute,  the
               orphanages'  maintenance,  installation  and  improvement  of
               arts and crafts as well as continuous building, we keep 160
               persons. All this requires an amount of about 40-50,000 liras,
               every  year.  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  can  we  gather  such  an
               amount in Messina? Can we rely on the civic charity for this
               money?

                    You know what the generous population is able to give.
               So  many  charitable  institutions  along  with  their  charity
               bazaars,  raffles,  and  charity  walks  give  little  margin  for  an
               institution  of  160  persons  and  needing  an  amount  of  about
               40-50,000 liras a year to keep going. In the presence of our
               beloved  archbishop  of  Messina  and  so  many  ladies  and
               gentlemen I say that these institutes for orphans do not keep
               going and developing through alms and donations, because
               alms and donations are hardly a fifth of the yearly economical
               figures of the following report.
                                                                         193
                    The city-hall contributed 3,000 liras, the province 1,000;
               what  the  sisters  begged  amounted  to  3,000,  monthly
               contributions to 1,000, casual alms to 1,000; altogether, these
               figures amount to 10,000 liras a year. How. do we meet the
               remnant money?

                    Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  have  always  deemed  that  an
               institute  for  the  education  of  children  and  youths  cannot
               pretend  to  keep  going  on  alms  only;  it  would  seem  like  a
               strong young person who would like living on begging instead
               of  working.  A  charitable  institution  is  allowed  to  ask  help
               within  some  bounds,  only  when  the  inmates  are  unable  to
               work such as the blind, cripples; feeble old persons, or little
               children. But relying mainly on alms]]></page><page Index="194"><![CDATA[to maintain an institute for youths jeopardizes the educational
               system.

                    The  youth  must  be  trained  in  a  salaried  work  from the
               time of their childhood. For an institute of education, work is a
               main  factor  for  building  morals  because  it  keeps  order,
               discipline,  life,  and  guarantees  the  future  of  the  youth  by
               teaching them how to earn their living through the sweat of
               their brow. Without work, neither religious nor civic education
               is possible. Pray and work formed the motto of the western
               hermits,  who  proclaimed  that  we  have  no  consistency  of
               religious principles without work, and they said so in spite of
               being dedicated to transcendental asceticism.

                    I  nurtured  these  ideas  from  the  very  beginning  of  this
               foundation,  and  yet  I  have  endured  for  so  many  years  the
               criticism that my program fosters idleness in the orphans! On
               the  contrary  and  despite  the  expense  figures  for  rent,
               building, maintenance, and installation of arts and crafts, as
               reported above, we have drawn the means to enable the two
               charitable institutes to continue through steady work and hard   194
               industries. Thanks be to God.

                    Our  installing  a  mill  and  a  bakery made  us grow  older
               beforehand,  but  we  have  solved  a  big  problem  of  our
               institutes by earning the daily bread through the pure wheat
               bread  sale;  this  work  is  contributing  to  our  expenses  with
               about  1,000  liras  a  month  and  is  giving  the  people  bread
               perfectly  hygienic  and  nutritious,  which  is  considered  the
               surest  one  to  our  great  satisfaction.  (9)  We  had  already
               installed  a  clothing  factory  for  various  products  such  as
               stockings, shirts, shorts, shawls, under vests, and the like.

                    While visiting the exposition of our works, you have seen
               embroidery in white, silk, and gold, crochet works,]]></page><page Index="195"><![CDATA[pillows  for  lace  making,  golden  yarns,  old  fashioned  laces,
               man-made  flowers  of  paper,  cloth,  and  metal.  Quite  a  few
               years ago we started a floriculture; fresh flower wreaths made
               by  our  orphans  signifying  the  incense  of  prayer  for  dear
               memories,  while  bunches  of  roses  or  gardenias  are
               perfuming rich tables of weddings. Incidentally, I add that we
               have installed a shoe factory, a tailor shop, and a typography
               in the boys' orphanage. With this, I end my report.

                    Ladies and gentlemen, you have noticed that a supreme,
               invisible  hand,  the  hand of  divine  providence  has  driven us
               from the humble beginning, from the dark slums of Avignone
               quarter up to the founding of two charitable institutes, to the
               opening  of  two  other  houses  in  the  province,  and  to  the
               formation  of  a  community  of  sisters,  who  are  trained  in  the
               school of sacrifice and charity, who are learned in literature
               and  art,  who  are  going  to  continue  the  rescue  of  the
               abandoned, unsafe orphans. To conclude, let me say these
               words to you: « I recommend my orphans to you. »

                    I  am  not  asking  of  you  the  usual  alms!  I  know  that  so   195
               many charitable institutions in Messina knock at your door, so
               I want to be reasonable in my requests. The orphans and I
               are most grateful far the contribution that you have given in
               various circumstances, but now I am asking these additional
               favors:  your  moral  support,  your  benevolence,  your  pious
               consideration on these institutes, your good will to help them
               not  only  through  alms,  but  even  better  through  your  advice
               and  good  acquaintances,  especially  when  a  word,  a
               recommendation may help. I ask of you not to accept easily
               the unjust censure or rumors that people spread among you
               in order to estrange you from me, by speaking ill of me and of
               my activities as if they were based on a bad administration or
               were]]></page><page Index="196"><![CDATA[profiteering  through  the  institutes'  industries.  Ladies  and
               gentlemen,  censuring  and  demolishing  is  an  easy  task,  but
               you are wise enough and experienced enough to understand
               how much it takes to build something important.

                    Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  ask  of  you  an  additional
               facilitation  that  you  cannot  deny  to  these  orphans  who  are
               standing enraptured before you. Since they earn their living
               by work more than by begging, and since you may need an
               embroidered trousseau for your daughters who are going to a
               conspicuous  wedding,  please  commission  it  at  our
               orphanage. For instance, if a young married couple is coming
               back from the church and you want to give them a basket of
               flowers  as  a  gift,  please  remember  these  orphans  who  are
               asking you for work. On Nov. 2, you are going to lay down a
               fresh  flower  wreath on  the  tomb  of a  beloved  dead:  please
               resort to these orphans, who while settling up the flowers will
               also pray for the repose of your cherished soul, who will be
               delighted in it. If your family uses knitted goods and you need
               some of them, please commission them from these orphans,
               who will serve you both punctually and exactly.           196

                    Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  ask  you  for  work.  If  the  little
               children of my orphanage have the right to ask your alms, the
               youth already trained in the work do not like living by begging,
               but want to work, even though they have to shorten their rest.
               While eating their daily bread, they want to say, « we earned
               it through our benefactors who gave us a profitable work. May
               God bless them » (Speech, Aug. 20, 1906).


                        12. THE MILL AT SAN PIER NICETO

                    Pray  and  work!  is  both  the  motto  of  the  Catholic
               institutions and the rule for any well-doing. Prayer indicates]]></page><page Index="197"><![CDATA[the worshipping of God, the holiest religion, and your keeping
               in  mind  Jesus'  saying,  «  You  can  do  nothing  without  me  »
               (Jn. 15, 5). Work indicates that the human beings must not be
               idle expecting everything from God, they must instead bend
               to work in order to comply with the Bible's saying, « With the
               sweat on your brow shall you earn your bread » (Gen. 3, 19).
               These words almost have a literal application to the sowing of
               the wheat, which is the chief element of life. Everyone knows
               the anguish the people endure while sowing in the midst of
               weather  conditions,  harvesting  and  threshing  under  the
               scorching  sun  as  well  as  while  taking  care  of  the  work  in
               order to make wheat bread.

                    If  there  is  any  aliment  which  must  be  accompanied  by
               prayer, such an aliment is wheat, because our Lord taught us
               to ask the daily bread and the Bible tells us to learn from the
               ants: « The ants, a race with no strength, yet in the summer
               they make sure of their food » (Prov. 30, 25).

                    Wheat is a great blessing of God. It is the divine provi-
               dence's most consoling, expressive sign. The bags full of this   197
               blessed  earthly  fruit  coming  back  and  forth  from  the  mill,
               transformed into flour in a few minutes, and then worked into
               bread cannot help touching the Christians who should see the
               divine providence's benefits in everything.

                    Bread is so sacred that it makes us bless the donor; for
               this  reason  picking  up  and  kissing  it  when  it  falls  on  the
               ground is appropriate. The offering of bread, flour, and wheat
               to  God,  who  is  the donor  of  any  good,  was  considered  the
               most  sacred  in  the  Old  Testament...  better  yet,  God  was
               jealous of wheat pretending the offering of its first fruits as the
               most pleasant.

                    Even though modest and in the first stages, this mill]]></page><page Index="198"><![CDATA[also represents other things: because it is born in the hands
               of priests along with sisters and is baptized with the blessing
               of the priest of God, it shares in the humanitarian institution
               which takes away so many poor children from the social risks,
               sheltering  and  forming  them  into  good  Christians  through
               prayer  and  work.  Oh!  How  marvelous  is  the  sound  of
               children's  voices  ascending  from  their  innocence  to  heaven
               when it is combined with this clamor of the driving machine
               and the stones transforming wheat into flour! On one side is
               the  blast-furnace  that  works  this  wonder  in  the  sight  of  the
               human beings; on the other side is the children's living flame
               of faith that supports this miracle in the eyes of God.

                    This factory standing between the church and the pious
               institute,  and  the  inspiring  sight  of  the  religious  garb,  is  a
               moralizing  element  training  and  teaching  these  tender
               daughters of Niceto's population what work means, and what
               they  must  do  if  they  are  to  eat  the  bread  that  divine
               providence provides. It reminds each one to lift up his mind to
               the operations of divine providence, in the holy fear of God,
               who can make this chief aliment disappear in a moment.    198

                    People of St. Piero, woe if tomorrow you do not hear the
               roar of this revolving wheel and the grinding stones when you
               pass by! Woe if you have no wheat to grind! What a gloomy
               thought arose in my mind by the view of this mill and the tons
               of  wheat  being  transformed  into  flour  to  be  delivered  to  so
               many poor families! God is giving us bread in these terrible,
               threatening times; but He can also withdraw His helping hand
               as He sometimes does to punish our faults!

                    Unfortunately  we  are  living  in  a  time  of  divine  punish-
               ments,  and  the  ghost  of  famine  is  likely  to  rise  from  the
               bloody, grievous war. The submarines sink the ships full]]></page><page Index="199"><![CDATA[of  wheat  going  to  feed  the  people,  while  the  fields  are
               abandoned  for  lack  of  workers.  What  next?  Nowadays  the
               view of a mill receiving wheat and giving flour is a lesson on
               the holy fear of God by reminding human conscience that our
               default  may  dry  up  the  source  of  divine  providence;  on  the
               other hand, it also reminds us to be faithful to our Lord Jesus
               Christ and to his holy law, if we want the daily bread not to
               fail.

                    Seventy years ago, when the most holy Virgin appeared
               to the innocent little shepherds Melanie and Maximin on the
               mountain of La Salette, in France, she said to them: « The
               arm  of  my  Son  is growing heavier  and I  cannot  hold  it  any
               longer.  Nuts  and  grapes  will  rot.  »  After  touching  on  the
               danger of famine, she added: « It the people convert, every
               stone will become a heap of wheat! » Generally speaking, the
               people are not likely to convert. Nations and governments not
               only do not return to Jesus Christ's feet, but when the chiefs
               of  the  nations  in  Europe  name  God,  they  make  politics  by
               using  His  name  as  to  have  Him  on  their  part.  Human
               madness, how far astray you go!                           199

                    Will  we  give  up  hope  for  receiving  forgiveness  from
               God? Doesn't God see those who fear him with holy, filial fear
               of the earthly conflagrations? If a man fears the Lord, evil will
               not come his way (Eccl. 33, 1).

                    This little factory that starts the bread-making of wheat,
               which  is  the  first  fruit;  this  mill  almost  connected  with  the
               temple of God, this useful industry born of a priest and a few
               sisters  under  the  protection  of  faith  and  surrounded  by  the
               prayer  and  the  work  of  so  many  little  creatures  of  God
               teaches  us  the  meaning  of  divine  providence,  the  gratitude
               due to the donor of all goods, and the holy fear we must have
               when we eat the bread coming from this mill. St. Augustine
               wrote that our marvel]]></page><page Index="200"><![CDATA[at the produce of a seed forming one ear of wheat with 1,000
               grains  must  not  be  less  than  our  marvel  at  the  miracle  our
               Lord Jesus Christ worked when he fed 4,000 persons with 5
               loaves. How grateful we should be toward the Most High, who
               gives  us  enough  wheat  for  our  daily  bread,  as  well  as  the
               facility to transform it into flour!

                    I  cannot  help  saying  the  last  reason  which  is  strictly
               connected  with  today's  circumstances.  If  wheat  is  the  most
               sacred among the products of the earth because it signifies
               divine providence and gives us the daily bread, which Jesus
               Christ  taught  us  to  ask  and  work  for,  we  also  have  to
               somehow  consider  it  as  the  material  which  forms  the  most
               august Sacrament, the Most Holy Eucharist. For this reason
               the  prophet  Zechariah  said:  Corn  will  make the  young men
               flourish, and sweet wine the maidens (Zech. 9, 17). Here, the
               corn  signifies  the  Holy  Sacrament,  Jesus  Christ's  adorable
               flesh; the wine, his Most Precious Blood. We receive both of
               them  along  with  Jesus  Christ's  soul  and  divinity  in  the
               Communion.
                                                                         200
                    From this point of view, the installation of our mill is of
               greatest importance for it provides pure flour for the hosts that
               perpetuate our Lord Jesus Christ's sacramental life on earth.
               A  mill  that  makes  sure  the  forming  of  such  an  august
               Sacrament  for  the  souls'  spiritual  life  is  somehow  a  divine
               institution!

                    Ladies and gentlemen, I let you know that with this mill
               we aim at our best service to the Eucharist. I wish that this
               wheel and stones continue to rotate by day and by night to
               form  purest  flour  to  form  the  hosts  of  which  thousands  and
               thousands of souls in San Pier Niceto, in the province, and in
               Sicily are fed! Then the abundance of divine providence will
               fill the earth and the punishment of the Lord will be averted
               (Speech, Nov. 26, 1916).]]></page><page Index="201"><![CDATA[13. UNWARRANTED CHARGE

                       The people say that I shelter children too easily. They
               do  not  know  the  moral  pressure  under  which  I  find  myself
               more than often. Today it is an high ranking person pleading
               for  a  child,  tomorrow  a  representative  of  the  public  press
               interceding  for  another  child,  then  it  is  a  benefactor
               .pretending to shelter an abandoned little girl. Ironically, the
               same person who has criticized me for accepting children too
               readily, is the one who will later insist that I take one that he
               recommends. To refuse is embarrassing, for who can refuse
               a bare-footed, sad-eyed child who seems to be saying to the
               sister, « I have no mother, take me with you! »

                       If I had taken the compasses as a cool administrator
               from  the  time  I  began  sheltering  abandoned  children,  first  I
               would not have bartered my little things; second, to balance
               the  sheltering  of  the  poor  abandoned  orphans  with  the
               meager contributions, I would not have formed the institutes.
               Any enterprise requires initiative and impulse, but when the
               matter  is  about  orphans  who  get  lost  day  after  day,  then   201
               initiative and impulse are even more urgent. In Messina we
               have two orphanages that shelter many children, giving them
               an  education,  life,  and  safety;  instead  of  getting  lost,  these
               children  found  their  right  path.  Why  should  I  extinguish  the
               flame  or  instinct  that  drove  me  up  to  here?  For  a  cool,
               inappropriate  calculation?  Besides,  I  somehow  restrained
               myself;  to  the  persons  who  charge  me  with  sheltering  all
               children that the people ask me for it I say that the charge is
               false.  I  often  do  violence  to  myself  by  declining  to  shelter
               children in order to avoid both going beyond my possibilities
               and  jeopardizing  the  accepted  ones.  For  that  reason  I
               sometimes  found  myself  at  variance  with  the  people  who
               pressed on me to shelter children. Such persons were]]></page><page Index="202"><![CDATA[the same who had charged me with receiving orphans with
               impunity.

                    As to how we are taking care of the orphans, ladies and
               gentlemen, please come to check for yourselves. As a tutor, I
               somehow know my duties. It is not only with the salvation of
               souls and religious education that I am concerned, but I also
               take great care of my orphaned children's bodily health and
               civil education. Good nutrition, hygiene, cleanness, and good
               manners  are  main  factors  of  the  educational  system  in  my
               institutes.

                    As for nutrition, please look at the children to see how
               rubicund and healthy they are. As for hygiene, I pride myself
               on the fact, for I follow the Kneip's system, I have read the
               Mantegazza's  treatise,  and  keep  hygiene  seriously.  In  our
               four refectories, we follow specific rules about moral, hygienic
               precepts, and good manners in eating. (10)

                    Our  institutes  are  provided  with  inside  water  facilities,
               and children wash any time they need. The institute for girls   202
               has a three tank laundry along with running water; there, the
               laundresses wash, cleanse, and mend the clothes every day,
               and  at  every  week-end  place  the  neat  clothes  on  each
               person's bed. Both houses have rooms for wardrobes, where
               clothes,  suits,  and  dresses  are  distinguished  by  personal
               identification number.

                    The  dormitories  are  wide  and  airy;  the  one far  girls  ,is
               superlatively airy and sunny. Air and light are the main factors
               of  life,  and  we  complain  that  too  many  people  ignore  this
               important hygienic rule, which is so important. The 50 beds
               dormitory at the Holy Spirit has 9 windows in the south, two in
               the east, two in the north, 1 in the west, and is provided with
               little venting windows at the bottom along with 6 air-holes on
               the top. During the day, the windows are opened; in summer
               time, they are]]></page><page Index="203"><![CDATA[opened even in the night, when it is possible. Thanks to God,
               the  prosperous  health  my  orphans  are  enjoying  depends
               mainly on the observance of this hygienic rule: air, air, always
               air,  fresh  air,  new  air,  pure  air  by  day  and  night,  in  the
               dormitory, in the laboratory, in the school, during play-time, in
               the refectory, and everywhere.

                    We hold motion in great esteem. The boys are somehow
               trained  like  soldiers;  they  walk  in  the  country  once  a  week,
               and  enjoy  regular  play-time  every  day.  I  once  set  up
               gymnastic  tools,  but  later  I  took  them  away  because  a  boy
               ran a serious risk. We also have a little theater to entertain
               and  educate  the  boys.  The  orphanage  for  girls  is  provided
               with  wide  gardens,  where  children  play  and  rejoice  during
               their recreation.

                    Someone  says:  the  institute  for  boys  is  on  the  ground
               floor,  and  the  dormitory  must  be  improved.  Ladies  and
               gentlemen, can you spare me your money? Spare me it, and
               I  assure  you  that  I  will  build  up  an  institute  model  in  short
               time! I know very well which things my institutes need in order   203
               to reach perfection; but, we have begun from nothing and I
               dare to say that we have come a long way, thanks to God. I
               also  have  other  ideals  and  I  am  going  straight  to  reach my
               goals (Speech, Aug. 20, 1906) .


                                14. RECAPITULATION

                    Saving tender children is a holiest work to which we will
               attend with sacrifice, deeply aware of the excellent good we
               do when we take them away from vagabondage, risks, and
               depravity  and  provide  them  with  a  sound  education  and
               environment. Thus, by God's help we form them to become
               good  Christians,  perfect  Catholics,  honest  and  industrious
               citizens as well as good parents when]]></page><page Index="204"><![CDATA[they  marry.  We  will  keep  in  mind  that  educating  children
               requires  continuous  sacrifices  and  self-denial  as  well  as  it
               implies troubles, want, worries, and difficulties. Let us accept
               everything willingly for the sake of our adorable Lord Jesus
               Christ.

                    To be successful in this holiest enterprise and to help the
               children to succeed, we have:

                    1. To edify them in everything and everywhere, keeping
               in mind the divine teacher's threat: « If anyone should cause
               one of these little ones to turn away from his faith in me, it
               would be better... » (Mt. 18, 6).

                    2.  To  pray  every  day  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  to
               Immaculate  Mary  that  the  children  be  docile,  improve,  and
               grow up with the fear of God.

                    3. To help them receive the holy sacraments, especially
               Holy  Communion  with  good  dispositions,  encouraging  them
               to go to confession every week after a good examination of   204
               conscience.

                    4. To make them delight in pious practices, in well-timed
               prayer, meditation, and holy rosary, sometimes allowing them
               to share with us in order to win goad workers, etc. We have to
               instill in their heart love for Jesus and Mary, devotion to St.
               Joseph, the guardian angel, the patron saints, and St. Louis
               Gonzaga,  whose  pious  union  Luigini  Sons  of  Immaculate
               Mary must be taken in vigor. Let us also give them scapulars,
               inscribing  them  to  confraternities  in  order  that  they  draw
               spiritual goods for their success. Let them also attend mass
               every day with recollection.

                    5.  To  teach  them  catechism  every  day,  making  them
               undergo the yearly examination and giving awards to the best
               ones. It is also important to teach them good manners twice a
               week.]]></page><page Index="205"><![CDATA[6.  To  make  them  attend  the  elementary  school  along
               with  regular  examination  with  a  pious,  Catholic,  upright
               teacher. The best ones will be awarded a prize at the end of
               the year.

                    7. To make them improve in arts and crafts so that they
               may earn their living honestly. The master trainers of art must
               be  persons  of  good  morals;  but  they  have  no  complete
               jurisdiction on children, who will be under our surveillance.

                    8. To watch over children because it is a strict precept
               and a duty of ours. Directors and assistants will keep a watch
               on  them  in  the  church,  in  the  laboratories,  in  the  school,  in
               play-time, and in the dormitories knowing that children have a
               keen  instinct  to  escape  from  surveillance;  therefore  the
               educator  must  be  smarter  than  they  are.  The  devil  seeks
               depravity of children constantly, but the assistant must elude
               Satan's snares by preserving the children who are entrusted
               to him immaculate for the Lord!

                    9.  To  love  children  with  pure,  holy  affection,  with  deep   205
               understanding  of  charity,  tender,  fatherly  charity  in  God
               because  this  is  the  secret  of  the  secrets  to  win  and  save
               them. We have to deal with affection and meekness as well
               as  with  reserve,  which  prevent  children  from  intimacy  and
               ,confidence through reverential fear. Children must never be
               insulted.  If  necessary,  punishment  must be given  in  such  a
               way  that  children  know  it  is  for  their  good.  Children  must
               never  be  reproached  for  private  faults  in  the  presence  of
               others,  especially  the  little  ones  who  might  run  risks  of
               scandal. In such a case, the warning or punishment must be
               in private. The superior will never become vexed with children
               nor show a grudge or lack of confidence against them. It is
               better to conceal]]></page><page Index="206"><![CDATA[some faults instead of disheartening or making children grow
               weak.

                    Punishment  or  strong  warnings  must be  avoided  when
               they  may  provoke  reactions;  it  would  be  like  destroying  a
               building.  Because  each  educator  needs  God's  enlight-
               enments, he will ask them from the Lord and the  mother of
               good counsel every day, even with tears and internal prayer
               in  the  daily  occasions.  Educating  children  is  the  art  of arts,
               the science of sciences, and only a few have it, because one
               should be a philosopher and a theologian and a great expert
               of the human heart and a saint to be a perfect educator of a
               child.  As  for  us,  let  us  do  our  best  by  work  and  prayer  to
               Jesus and Mary, imploring enlightenment about education of
               children.


                           15. TWO PHOTOGRAPHS (11)

                    In my orphanage, children are taught to respect civic and
               ecclesiastical  authorities  independently  from  principles  of   206
               politics, which we do not mention in our teaching, only aiming
               at forming honest citizens as well as good parents.

                    To  understand  well  the  importance  of  such  a  humani-
               tarian institution which everyone esteems, we don't need any
               demonstration; to please you, however, I am going to show
               an  eloquent  proof  that  speaks  by  itself:  two  photographs
               which were shot in Taormina. Please listen to me. A 14 year
               old  orphaned  girl  from  Taormina  worked  as  a  scullion  in
               various houses to earn her living. Beaten and fired because
               she  pilfered,  she  went  from  bad  to  worse  in  other  houses.
               Dispersed,  ragged,  hair  topsy-turvy,  and  morally  upset  she
               was  wearisome  to  herself  and  others,  having  no  hope  of  a
               good  future.  One  day  she  was  drawing  water  at  a  fountain
               when a foreigner passed]]></page><page Index="207"><![CDATA[by, looked at her, and took a snapshot after letting her pose
               as a characteristic girl.

                    In  the  photo  she  appeared  like  an  African  savage
               woman, barefoot and muddy, her hair topsy-turvy, the look on
               her  face  troubled;  on  the  whole,  she  infused  a  feeling  of
               horror  and  compassion,  because  she  was  an  orphan
               abandoned to herself in the bloom of her youth. That photo
               appeared in some post-cards of Taormina.

                    Some days later, pious people asked me to shelter that
               poor orphan; I received her along with her extreme poverty.
               The youth was trained in education and vocational work, and
               at  21  years  of  age  she  was  already  transformed:  no  one
               could  recognize  her  as  the  girl  in  the  foreigner's  snapshot.
               When  she  left  the  institute  to  be  hired by  a  noble  family  of
               Taormina,  we  took a  photo.  What  a difference  between  the
               first  photo  and  the  second  one!  The  latter  shows  the  good
               education's  miraculous  effects!  The  photo  shows  a  neatly
               dressed  serene  youth,  whose  look  transpires  the  gentle
               dignity of a calm soul that is born again, that looks forward to   207
               the  future  with  confident  trust.  She  is  handling  an  opened
               book,  which  signifies  morals,  dignity,  and  culture.  Where  is
               the African savage woman, whose gloomy look disheartened
               and distressed? The African savage woman disappeared not
               through  the  blizzards  of  life,  but  through  the  beneficial,
               enlivening ray of the civil, moral, and intellectual education!

                    Ladies and gentlemen, look at the two photos that were
               shot  seven  years  ago.  See  the  difference  that  seven  years
               and a half of education in my orphanage of Taormina have
               made!  The  youth  is  Rosaria  Scimone.  This  youth  also
               showed the education's strength by liberating herself from the
               snares of which present society is full; by now, she lives in a
               noble family at Acireale, where I]]></page><page Index="208"><![CDATA[saw her the last time receiving good counseling by the refined
               family, which is happy with her.


                                      THE POOR

                        1. LOVE AND RESPECT FOR THE POOR

                    Let  us  promise  to  love  and  respect  the  poor,  seeking
               their bodily and spiritual well-being. The superiors promise to
               always  maintain  the  kitchen  soup  for  them,  giving  bread,
               alms, and other things as we have done till now (Resolves,
               June 17, 1920).

                    The Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus will always open
               the door to the poor of Jesus Christ to give them spiritual and
               temporal  charity.  Even  though  the  order  has  no  asylums  or
               shelters for the poor, still it must receive them in the atrium or
               in a reserved room every day at lunch or dinner to give them
               a dish of food with bread. At least every Sunday we should
               gather,  evangelize,  and  teach  them  the  Christian  doctrine,   208
               helping them receive Holy Communion. The most holy Heart
               of  Jesus  will  be  greatly  delighted  if  we  encourage  them  to
               attend mass every day receiving Holy Communion frequently.
               Because  we  see  the  suffering  Jesus  in  the  most  poor  and
               abject, we must treat them with particular affection applying
               some discipline and a learning program. The most favorably
               disposed and patient among the priests and the brothers will
               be entrusted with this task. Both the orphans and the poor will
               be  told  to  pray  every  day  to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy
               Church, adhering to the pious union of the Poor of the Heart
               of  Jesus,  which  will  be  approved  by  the  ecclesiastical
               authority (C.R.).

                    The Rogationists will remember that our pious institute is
               born for the holy mission of giving; the more we]]></page><page Index="209"><![CDATA[give, the more we will be given by the Lord because he said:
               « (You) will receive a hundred times more, and will be given
               eternal life » (Mt. 19, 29).


                            2. A CHARGE CAUSING GRIEF

                    Some persons charge me with helping the poor. To tell
               the truth, this charge hurts me because helping the afflicted,
               miserable, abandoned, dying by starvation and cold weather,
               cripples, blind, and unable to work is a duty for all Christians,
               even  'when  they  have  to  make  an  effort;  in  fact,  our  Lord
               Jesus Christ taught us to do to others what we want be done
               to  us.  They  say:  «  But  you  have  deprived  my  orphans  of
               anything  in  order  to  help  care  of  the  orphans.  »  To  these
               persons  I  answer:  «  Never  have  I  deprived  my  orphans  of
               anything  in  order  to  help  the  poor,  because  I  obtained  the
               means  from  public  charity  and  I  have  experienced  that  a
               supreme providence, in whose presence both rich and poor
               are equal, always provided me with the means to give a dish
               of food and some bread to the most derelict and needy. »   209

                    They respond that I help beggars who are able to work. I
               say to them: « Please come to my institute at lunch time; »
               you will see the pool of Siloe full of old feeble people, either
               blind or cripples, or drooping by starvation. I assure you that I
               held some of them who had fainted from starvation. If some
               of them are unemployed, it is due to lack of work. Will society
               condemn these to death because they lack work? Charity and
               humaneness dare not, nor they deny them a piece of bread.

                    These  persons  insist  that  some  of  the  poor  steal  and
               cheat  me:  What  can  I  say?  It  is  possible  that  a  rascal
               conceals himself under the guise of extreme poverty picking
               up a dish of food and a piece of bread. What a great]]></page><page Index="210"><![CDATA[thing! But, I cannot put into practice the saying, « so that the
               guilty person may not be saved, the just must perish! » So I
               cannot deny a piece of bread to so many unhappy persons
               for fear that a rascal is concealed among them! They steal!
               Please tell me, were you never robbed? Did human fraud and
               simulation  never take money from  your  pocket  or  safe  box,
               your vigilance and shrewdness notwithstanding?

                    Perhaps  I  am  striking  a  discordant  note  that  revives
               gloomy memories to you!... So I beg you not to charge me so
               easily  if  a  beggar  who  is doubly  poor  happens  to  be  in  the
               midst of so many unhappy people when I try to give a helping
               hand. Society took no care of him when he was a little beggar
               or rascal abandoning him to himself, so he took a wrong way.
               Will society condemn him to  death today? At least, may he
               find a gentle breeze of peace in the breath of celestial charity
               which  is  able  to  get  him  back  to  a better  counsel  (Speech,
               Aug. 20, 1906)!


                      3. HELPING AND EVANGELIZING THE POOR               210

                    Aware of the command and the exhortations of our Lord
               Jesus Christ « give to everyone who asks you » and « give
               the  remainder  to  the  poor  »  ,  the  pious  institute  of  the
               Rogationists will be generous toward the poor, the afflicted,
               and the derelict. The kitchen soup for the poor will never fail
               in  each  institute,  and  after  providing  the  community  with
               everything, a dish of food, some bread, and some money will
               be given to all the spoor who knock at our door, taking into
               consideration  their  age  and  ailments.  Helping  the  poor  this
               way  or  giving  them  clothes  or  other  forms  of  charity,  after
               providing  the  community  will  be  done  with  joy  because  the
               apostle says: « God delights in the people who give with joy.
               »]]></page><page Index="211"><![CDATA[Alms  must  be  given  in  the  spirit  of  faith,  remembering
               our Lard Jesus Christ's promise « you will receive a hundred
               times more »  and « give to others, and God will give to you:
               you will receive a full measure, a generous helping, -poured
               into your hands - and all that you can hold. » On one hand,
               we  have  to  provide  the  means  of  living  for  us  and  the
               institutions;  on  the  other  hand,  we  have  to  keep  our  divine
               Savior's saying « giving is better than receiving... »  Believing
               in our Lord Jesus Christ's words will remind us that he said: «
               Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do
               unto me. »

                    A  form  of  charity  we  must  have  at  heart,  performing  it
               with kindness and sacred care, is hospitality. If the guests are
               poor, we will provide them with everything without charging.
               Let us remember St. Paul's saying: « Because of hospitality
               Abraham  deserved  lodging  the  angels.  »  Each  house  will
               have the guest rooms separated from the institute so that the
               guests may have no relations with the community. (12) Some
               brother or priest will take care of them.
                                                                         211
                    To  foster  the  practice  of  alms  and  charity  toward  our
               neighbor  in  different  ways,  we  quote  the  touching  words  of
               the Holy Spirit through the prophet Isaiah (58, 7-11)

                    «... (Is not this the sort of fast that pleases me...) To let
               the oppressed go free, and break every yoke, to share your
               bread  with  the  hungry,  and  shelter  the  homeless  poor,  to
               clothe the man you see to be naked, and not turn from your
               own  kin?  Then  will  your  light  shine  like  the  dawn  and  your
               wound  will  be  quickly  healed  over.  Your  integrity  will  go
               before  you  and  the  glory  of  Yahweh  behind  you.  Cry,  and
               Yahweh will answer; call, and he will say, "I am here". If you
               do away with the yoke, the clenched fist, the wicked word, if
               you give your bread]]></page><page Index="212"><![CDATA[to the hungry, and relief to the oppressed, your light will rise
               in  the  darkness,  and  your  shadows  become  like  noon.
               Yahweh  will  always  guide  you,  giving  you  relief  in  desert
               places. He will give strength to your bones and you shall be
               like  a  watered  garden,  like  a  spring  of  water  whose  waters
               never run dry. »

                    But helping those who belong directly to the Lord such
               as the priests and the religious communities in need pleases
               God at the highest, attracting his best promises of retribution
               and celestial blessings.

                    We  cannot  help  being  touched  and  generous  toward
               those  who  belong  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  completely
               trusting in the prophet Malachi's divine promise: « Bring the
               full tithes and dues to the storehouse so that there may be
               food  in  my  house,  and  then  see  if  I  do  not  open  the  flood
               gates  of  heaven  for  you  and  pour  out  blessing  for  you  in
               abundance. For your sake I will lay a strict injunction on the
               locust  not  to  destroy  the fruits  of  your  soil nor  to  make  the
               vine  in  your  fields  barren,  says  Yahweh  Sabaoth.  All  the   212
               nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delights,
               says Yahweh Sabaoth » (Mal 3, 10...).

                    Temporal charity must be combined with spiritual charity
               because the poor need evangelization. Some of them do not
               approach sacraments for many years either from laziness or
               from ignorance of the Christian doctrine. At least on Sundays
               and feasts, before giving food, we have to gather and teach
               them the catechism, the I Believe, Our Father, and Hail Mary
               making  there  pray  and  approach  the  sacraments  of
               confession and Holy Communion. We have to bear in mind
               that our Lord, as a sign that he was the divine messiah, to the
               miracle of his omnipotence added the miracle of his mercy: «
               The  poor  are  evangelized.  »  But  evangelizing  the  poor
               without helping them]]></page><page Index="213"><![CDATA[is an unfinished work. We must join both; by so doing, we will
               do a good service pleasing the adorable heart of Jesus, who
               will  reciprocate  by  giving  us  copious,  divine  blessings;
               therefore,  this  double  charity  must  never  fail  (From  the
               Appendix to our primal Constitutions).


                              4. WORKING PERSONNEL

                    To  the  institute's  employees,  workers,  and  the  people
               who are helped by it.

                    Dear sirs:

                    You  know  that  the  institute  to  which  you  belong  as
               employees  or  workers  or  inmates  or  because  you  are
               somehow  aided  has  no  property  nor  cash  funds  nor  sure
               income  nor  fixed  profits,  but  lives  by  the  help  of  divine
               providence.  You  also  know  that  I  have  many  orphans  to
               maintain  in  two  institutes  as  well  as  many  duties  to  fulfill.
               Given all this, we both are in great need of divine providence   213
               to meet our interests.

                    It is true that each one in his task, as myself in different
               ways, works to help things along, but everything will come to
               nothing without the help of divine providence, because God
               keeps  an  eye  on  the  human  fortunes  ruling  and  directing
               them according  to  his  supreme  will.  He makes  the  sun  rise
               and  the  earth  bloom,  gives  rain  and  provides  all  creatures
               with  things.  But  if  we  forget  God,  God  will  forget  us,  and
               despite  our  working,  toiling  around,  providence  will  not  or
               hardly come.

                    This is why I feel myself obliged to ask you to observe
               the  religious  duties  as  well  as  any other  Christian  duty.  On
               one hand, you want me to give work to you, paying you for it;
               on the other hand, I ask you not to hinder divine providence
               by forgetting God, because if He does]]></page><page Index="214"><![CDATA[not give me the means, I am unable to pay and reward you
               according  to  your  need  or  work;  if  you  do  not  comply  with
               your  duties  toward  Gad,  with  good  reason  I  have  fear  of
               losing His means. This is my interest and yours.

                    Besides, your religious duties are not intolerable burdens
               nor do I require of you great sacrifice, but religious acts that
               are  very  easy.  My  dearest  in  Jesus  Christ, please  consider
               that  we  are  unable  to  stay  in  the  grace  of  God,  unless  we
               fulfill our religious duties.

                    Living  without  confession,  Holy  Communion,  and  study
               of the main elements of our holy religion, living without lifting
               up  our  eyes  to  heaven  to  pray  and  adore  God  as our  Lord
               and Creator, living without considering our last end as well as
               the eternal destination, this is not a Christian living, a living of
               God's creatures, but a living of ungrateful beings, of fools who
               run the risk of getting lost for ever. By forgetting God and our
               religious  duties  it  becomes  unavoidable  for  us  to  fall  into
               many sins!
                                                                         214
                    This  is  both  the  rub  of  my  worries  and  our  common
               prejudice!  My  dearest,  I  assure  you  that  I fear  nothing,  and
               nothing disheartens me in the proceeding of these charitable
               institutes,  but  sin.  Want,  difficulties,  persecutions,  etc.
               everything  seems  like  nothing,  because  I  hope  and  trust  in
               the  Lord,  who  is  a  provident  and  loving  father.  But,  if  sin
               dwells among the people who live in the institutes, then I see
               everything lost!

                    My  dearest  brothers  and  sisters,  such  a  truth  the  Holy
               Spirit  manifested  in  these  words:  «  Virtue  makes  a  nation
               great, by sin whole races are disgraced » (Prov. 14, 34). Do
               you know why misery is reigning in the families, the families
               are fading, means are flailing, bankruptcies are common, and
               misfortunes  are  increasing?  Because  of  sin!  On  one  hand,
               the  people  live  far  off  from  God,  disregarding  the  religious
               duties and adhering]]></page><page Index="215"><![CDATA[to nothing but interest; on the other hand, God does not bless
               their business, industries, fields, and work; on one hand, we
               make plans, on the other hand, Gad makes them useless; we
               collect money, but God makes it disappear with no profit. In
               short, without the blessing of God, nothing goes on well; with
               the blessing of God, everything flourishes.

                    God  does  not  bless  the  people  who  disregard  the
               religious  duties  such  as  confession,  Holy  Communion,
               preaching, religious education, spiritual reading, and prayer in
               the morning and night. The persons who live oblivious of God
               are too feeble to overcome temptations, internal and external
               sins,  bad  thoughts,  bad  words,  and  bad  actions  reaching
               such  a  degree  as  to  even  justify  their  sins  by  calling
               themselves the best Christians.

                    But I think otherwise. I do not tike such people to share
               in my institutes, because such a sharing is to the prejudice of
               both  of  us.  One  Jonah  was more  than  enough  in  a  ship  to
               make  a  storm  rise,  threatening  the  ship  with  sinking.  Only
               when Jonah was thrown overboard did the storm die down. If   215
               I permit the sharing in my institute by the people who have no
               fear  of  God,  who  disregard  the  religious  duties,  mho  are
               defiled by transgressions of divine law I have good reason to
               fear that God and divine providence will cut the help, letting
               the storm sink us. But I am determined to expel the Jonahs
               for our common interest. To save the others, I have to cut the
               corrupted  member  who  attracts  divine  punishments.  If  I  do
               not behave this way, I will render an account to the Lord, who
               will punish me.

                    My dearest brothers and sisters:

                    Even though I am an unworthy minister of the Lord, I feel
               confident  that  you  will  receive  my  words  as  a  beneficial
               warning from our Lord Jesus Christ, who wants to]]></page><page Index="216"><![CDATA[drive you on a better way of living. Your being observant of
               the Christian law attracts the divine blessings on you during
               this life, making you worthy of eternal salvation. (13)



                                        NOTES

                   (1)   This  is the aim of education:  «It is of  greatest importance not
               to be  mistaken  both  in  education  and  in  the  direction  toward the
               last end,  because  education  and   last  end   are  intimately   con-
               nected. In fact, since education consists in forming the human being as it
               must be and behave in this terrestrial life in order to reach its last end for
               which  it  was    created,  it  is  obvious...  that  we  have  no  true  education
               when it does not aim  at the last end  (Pious XI, Encyclical  Divini illius
               Magistri, Deo. 31,  1929).

                   (2)  Keep in mind that our padre was writing when liberalism was
               reigning.   The   state  considered   itself   free   from   any   superior
               law, either divine or natural, and the individual  gloried in feeling himself
               free from the Church, revelation, God, and from the state... Invoking the
               name  of  God    in  the  school  or    in    public  offices   made    people  risk
               various trouble,  immediate dismissal from  work  included.   216

                   (3)   Our   padre   also   recommends   the   orphans   to   join
               various  pious  unions:    «You  know  that  all  of  us  are  associated  with
               several pious unions to profit  by their spiritual goods. You  also  know
               that every 6 months the new orphans are informed and told to associate
               the  pious  unions;  their  names  are  to  be  registered  in  the house  book
               before  communicating  the  list  to  the   directors'  offices  for  getting
               the  membership  card.  We  like  to   know   if  that  has  been   regularly
               made and exhort you to never neglect it. Remember that we usually give
               an   offering   for  the   membership   cards   and   something   more
               when figures or medals are mailed to us.
                   We  insist  on  the  yearly  practice  of  the  sacred  slavery,  on  the
               registration  at  Queen  of  Hearts  in  Rome,  and  the  tribute  to  be  sent.
               About the orphanages we point out that the female orphans will not be
               registered  nor  will say the  formula  of consecration, unless  they  are  at
               least 15 years old as well as instructed at least for a couple of years»
               (Circular, Jan. 1925).

                   (4)   First of all, the sisters will give good examples to the girls in
               speech,   love   for   work,   religious   practices,   obedience,   mutual]]></page><page Index="217"><![CDATA[respect,  etc.  avoiding  intlmaoy  and  confidence  with  them.  Woe  if
               they induced the girls to speak ill or refer or exchange mutual gifts or
               give  secret  messages.  By  doing  so  they  would  lose  their  own  dignity
               ruining  the  girls.  To  make  themselves  respected,  the  sisters  will  be
               reserved  and  decorous,  humble  and  polite,  avoiding  particular
               preferences. They will only give preference to merit. Wisdom knows how
               to combine dignity and decorum with humility and courtesy» (Rules for
               the sisters running the orphanages.
                   The  novice  overseer  will  be  always  vigilant  over  children  without
               getting tired or straying or being bored; she will keep watch so that none
               of  them  be  at  fault  with  discipline.  To  train  the  children  to  be  docile,
               obedient, and disciplined the sister will give good example: she will arm
               herself with patience, meekness, and charity talking almost always with
               gentle, mild voice, because such a behavior keeps children quiet more
               than any invective or hard reprehension. But the most effective means to
               make  children  docile  and  obedient  is  praying  to  God  for  them  and
               making  them  pray  for  the  same  purpose.  A  mild  educator  makes  the
               pupils mild. The sister will beware both of saying words of contempt to
               children and of beating them because she becomes bored watching over
               them (R. L. P.).
                   The  Little  Retreat  novices  will  consider  themselves  like  maid-
               servants of the girls and the poor, especially of those who belong to the
               pious  institute.  For  God's  glory,  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'
               consolation,  and  the  souls'  sanctification  the  novices  will  give  good   217
               example  to  children,  edifying  in  everything  through  the  exercise  of
               virtues, especially humility, obedience, patience, meekness, discipline as
               well as through a modest, contrite' appearance, and recollection during
               the prayer and the holy mass.
                   If  a  novice  is  offended  or  scorned  by  children,  she  will  show  no
               personal resentment, but will be patient and meek in order to edify them.
               Only when charity urges to refer the matter to the mother superior the
               novice  will  do  so  for  the  good  of  children,  but  without  a  feeling  of
               revenge or of personal satisfaction* (R. L. P.).

                   (5) « Children follow the educator's pattern; their behavior depends
               on  the  educator's  behavior;  therefore,  the  prefect  of  the  boys  will  be
               flawless in morals and religion making it appear in his actions, gestures,
               words as well as in his way of acting, talking, and thinking.
                   As to appearance, he will be somehow serious and lovable among
               the boys to make himself loved and feared. To keep them subject, he
               will be strong, but without showing pride or arrogance or anger; he will
               not  insult,  beat,  illtreat  them,  on  the  contrary  he  will  show  that  he  is
               warmly  interested  in  their  good,  and  the  boys  will  be  charmed  by
               perceiving and understanding it. This is the education's real secret!
                   When the educator is really interested in the pupils' good he loves]]></page><page Index="218"><![CDATA[them in a holy manner, and is concerned with their future. If they do
               not succeed, he can be strong enough to punish them when they are at
               fault, and  the  pupils  will never  feel  offended,  on  the  contrary  they  will
               love and fear their educator.
                   To succeed in everything, the prefect will pray to the Lord for help
               and enlightenment every day, because educating the youths is the art of
               the  arts  and  no  one  can  succed  in  it  without  the  Lord's  help  and
               enlightenment! He will also pray to the Lord and Our Lady every day so
               that his pupils may succeed and save their souls» (R. P. A.).
                   (6)   «A formula  of  this  prayer directed  to  the  most  holy  Im-
               maculate  Mary,  to  whom  our  orphanages  are  dedicated    since    their
               origin, is preserved in our orphanage.»
                   (7)     «  To  perfectly  fulfill his duty,  the  prefect will  watch  over  the
               boys  with  careful  attention.
                   Surveillance consists in keeping guard on their actions during work,
               prayer, and especially in play-time because it is then that the boys try to
               escape  his  supervision.  When  the  boys  are  playing,  he  will  not  be
               carefree, but will supervise from a place whence he is able to see all of
               them; if they are walking, he will be in their midst hearing their talk even
               though  they  speak  in  a  low  voice.  While  playing,  he  will  let  them  cry
               aloud and jump at their liking, but without laying hands on each other or
               beating or insulting the fellows or damaging the community's things or
               damaging their clothes by falling down on the ground.
                   During work time, he will watch over in the factories seeing that the   218
               boys are not idle, do not gossip, nor play nor struggle against the boss.
                   Also in the Church he will be most diligent, helping the boys enter
               composed  and  recollected.  To  be  of  help,  he  will  stop  them  at  the
               church's entrance till they are calm and silent; then he will lead them,
               recollected  and  reverent,  will  sign  himself  with  the  holy  water,  and
               genuflect in the middle of the aisle, teaching  the boys to do the same
               while going to their place; the vice prefect will enter last. The prefect will
               also see to it that the boys sit down or kneel at the proper time as well as
               follow the liturgy, composed and silent, answering the prayer all together
               with a moderate voice.
                   In  the  refectory,  he  will  demand  of  the  boys  fine  manners  and
               observance of silence.
                   Personal  attention  will  be  given  to  each  boy  that  he  be  provided
               with clothes and footwear every week and bed sheets every other week.
               The prefect will see to it that the boys take care of their clothes, having
               them  repaired  as  soon  as  possible,  and  that  they  observe  bodily
               neatness in the hands, face, neck, ears. If necessary, he will have the
               boys wash themselves in his presence.]]></page><page Index="219"><![CDATA[The boys are not allowed to do anything without permission nor to
               go to the parlor to talk with external persons nor to act as door keepers.
               While giving permissions the prefect will pay careful attention to prevent
               two boys from meeting alone far from surveillance. He must be careful
               because  boys  are  skilled  in  asking  permission  which  gives  them  the
               chance to meet alone » (R. P. A.).
                   Following the institute's character, system, and spirit the prefect will
               moralize the boys through appropriate instructions and exhortations. He
               will  beware  of  introducing  talks,  examples,  and  maxims  that  stimulate
               selfishness  or  wordliness  or  somehow  excite  pride,  vainglory,  and
               curiosity. His tales will be always most honest, innocent, and religious »
               (R. P. A.).
                   (8)   Keep in  mind that our padre was writing in  1880, when the
               institute's conditions allowed  that only.  Besides,  in  those times,  an
               elementary graduate worker was an exception.
                   (9)  Due to this certainty,  Messina archepiscopal chancery  office
               ordered all the priests  to buy  the hosts and  the wafers from  our female
               community at the  Holy Spirit.
                   Our padre wrote: through the bakery, our orphanage has another
               qualification in the city.
                   (10)   Moral precepts:  1) Say the prayer before and after eating.
                   2)  Eat to obey the natural law, to keep yourself in good health, and
               to live according to the will of God, not for gluttony.  3)   Listen to the
               spiritual reading at dinner so that the soul  may  be nourished. 4) Think   219
               of so many poor who are hungry, and resolve to help them as you can.
               5) Think of the eternal celestial table, where Jesus our Lord is waiting for
               us in his kingdom to give us the food of eternal glory,  if we deserve  it.
                   Hygienic precepts: 1) Eat slowly, and chew well the food. 2) Do not
               eat too hot food because it ruins our teeth and our digestion.
                   3)   Do not drink cold  beverage  soon   after eating  because   it
               ruins our digestion and our teeth.
                   Fine  manners  precepts:  1)  Eat  what  you  are  given  without
               complaining, and get used to eating any food. 2) Eat with fine manners
               and  take  your  time.  3)  Do  not  dirty  your  hands,  your  face,  and  your
               napkin.
                   4)   Do not rest your elbows on the table. 5)   Eat in  silence without
               making   noise.
                   (11)   The city hall  of Taormina  had  leased  the   building  to  the
               orphanage  for  600  liras  a  year.  More  than  once  the  anticlerical  bias
               threatened the orphans with expulsion. In March 1914, the city council
               administration  seemed  to  be  about  to  give  the  deadly  blow,  and  our
               padre published an open letter through the press addressing the mayor
               along with his council to defend the orphanage's rights. The Scimone's

                              EVANGELICAL ROGATION

                    I  declare  that  the  precepts  of  charity  will  form  the
               goal of my religious life in this  institute, and to reach it
               under the guide of holy obedience I will not spare myself
               in working hard for the spiritual and temporal good of my
               neighbor. To expand this charity to everyone as much as
               I  can,  I  will  aim  at  reaching  the  greatest,  universal,
               spiritual,  and  temporal  good  of  my  present  and  future
               neighbor  through  the  most  effective  means  of  the  «
               Evangelical Rogation of the Heart of Jesus», which forms
               the  institute's  special  mission.  To  reach  this  goal  I  will
               present my petitions to God in the mass, the prayer, the
               Holy, Communion, the visits to the Holy Sacrament, and
               the rosary, exhorting my brethren and the children who
               attend the catechism classes to do the same.


                                                                         221

                                1. ZEAL AND ROGATE

                    The  spirit  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation  of  Jesus'  Heart,
               which was given us by divine goodness must be kept always
               alive and fervid and must be spread through all the means at
               our disposal. (Resolves, June 17, 1920).

                    The  divine  mission  of  obeying  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's
               Rogate  is  entrusted  to  this  institute's  sisters  who  bear  its
               words printed on their chest: « Pray, therefore,... » They will
               take the vow of praying every day to the Lord that he send
               out  new  apostles  to  the  holy  Church, true ministers  of  God
               and  the  most  holy  Virgin,  who  preach  zealously  Jesus
               Christ's gospel in its purity all over the]]></page><page Index="222"><![CDATA[world along with morals, penance and observance of God's
               law,  necessity  of  prayer,  detachment  from  earthly  matters,
               death,  paradise,  hell;  as  well  as  life,  Passion,  death,  and
               resurrection  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  strengthening  the
               people  in  their  faith  so  that  the  enemy  may  not  prey  upon
               their souls. These holy vocations, these true ministers of the
               Church,  these  good  workers  of  the  mystical  harvest,  and
               these new apostles will form the particular object of the active
               and contemplative fife of this pious institute's sisters. So that
               this  prayer may  have better  results, the  sisters  will  do  their
               best  to  spread  it  among  the  people,  the  inmates  of  the
               institute,  and  other  persons  praying  to  the  Lord  that  he
               himself  will  expand  the  spirit  of  this  prayer  (Rules,  Oct.  6,
               1897).

                    Zeal is the virtue that seek divine glory and sanctification
               of souls. Due to human failings, no one is able to encompass
               all the objects of a virtue at the same time, but we are obliged
               to apply the virtue to particular objects in order to practice it.
               In our case, which is the best object for the zeal of the Poor of
               the  Holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  who  take  the  vow  to  foster  divine   222
               glory and salvation of souls? The object will be: winning good
               workers to the holy Church through prayer and cooperation.
               This object summarizes the best of everything to foster divine
               glory and salvation of souls. The reason is that the power and
               the  mission  of  glorifying  God  and  saving  souls  has  been
               entrusted  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  to  the  good  evangelical
               workers, who are the priests. He said to the apostles: « As
               the Father has sent me, so I send you. » Now, our Lord Jesus
               Christ's mission and his redemption aim at the Father's glory
               and our salvation, which form the mission and the aim of the
               Church's  ministers.  To  fulfill  this  mission,  God  endows  His
               priests with a particular power and grace: When they]]></page><page Index="223"><![CDATA[answer the Lord's call faithfully, no one is able to value the
               glory they give to God and the good they cause to souls. Who
               may  value  the  beneficial  effects  of  one  faithful  priest's
               ministry?  These  mysteries  of  grace  will  be  valued  at  the
               judgment  day only.  Considering  haw  much glory  one  divine
               mass gives to God and how much good it causes to so many
               souls  is  enough  to  somehow  understand  the  importance  of
               one  priest  who  says  mass  every  day.  If  we  consider  the
               whole ministry of a priest, we may conclude that a good priest
               is a glorifier of the Lord and a savior of souls: it is like Jesus
               Christ himself who gives the eternal Father what is due to His
               divine love by saving souls from eternal death!

                    Hence  we  realize  that  the  best,  surest,  and  easiest
               means to seek God's glory and salvation of souls is winning
               good priests to the holy Church, because this ins the shortest,
               surest way to reach God's glory and salvation of souls, which
               is the goal of the people who are enflamed by zeal (C.P.).


                         2. ROGATE AND OUR INSTITUTIONS                  223

                    I was still a deacon when I entered the Avignone Quarter
               for the first time, 22 years ago; (1) this quarter was the city's
               infamy, and it impressed me a great deal with its great misery
               and  abandon.  Those  unhappy  persons  were  living  like
               animals: all marriages were illegal, children were immersed in
               mud, and were exposed to immorality, and old people died on
               the  bare,  wet  ground  of  the  slums.  lt  reminded  me  of  the
               words of the gospel: « As he saw the crowds, his heart was
               filled  with  pity  for  them,  because  they  were  worried  and
               helpless,  like  sheep  without  a  shepherd.  So  he  said  to  his
               disciples, "There is]]></page><page Index="224"><![CDATA[a large harvest, but few workers to gather it in... Pray to the
               owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in
               his harvest" » (Mt. 9, 36-38).

                    Ever since I engaged myself to relieve those abandoned
               persons spiritually and materially as much as I could. To keep
               the  young  girls  safe,  a  loom  was  installed  in  one  slum  to
               teach them to work; it was the first seed of the orphanage for
               girls.  Later,  we  began  gathering  the  boy  beggars  in  a  few
               small rented houses thus starting the orphanage for boys. But
               the word of the gospel: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the
               harvest that he will send out workers to gather in His harvest
               »,  'was  predominant  in  my  thoughts  since  the  beginning  of
               this pious institute.

                    I thought: what is the meaning of the few orphans who
               are saved, the few poor who are evangelized, compared with
               the  millions  and  millions  of  people  who  get  lost  and  are
               abandoned  like  sheep  without  a  shepherd?  I  looked  at  my
               ,poor  means,  at  the  smallest  sphere  of  my  activity,  and
               sought for a solution. I found a wide, unlimited outlet in the   224
               adorable words of our Lord Jesus Christ: « Pray, therefore, to
               the  owner  of  the  harvest  that,  he  will  send  out  workers  to
               gather in his harvest. »  I seemed to have found the secret of
               all good works and of the salvation of all souls.

                    Through this predominant idea, I considered this institute
               not simply as a charitable institution aiming at saving some
               orphans and poor, but aiming at a greater and wider goal: the
               divine  glory,  salvation  of  souls,  and  the  good  of  the  whole
               Church. Both the aim of picking up from the most holy mouth
               of  Jesus  Christ  the  command  of  his  divine  Heart:  «  Pray,
               therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that he  will  send  out
               workers to gather in his harvest »  and the zeal for fulfilling it
               in the best way]]></page><page Index="225"><![CDATA[for the greater consolation of the Heart of Jesus form the goal
               of this institute.

                    Truly, the spirit of God blows wherever it wishes (Jn. 3,
               8);  he  chose  what  the  world  looks  down  on,  and  despises,
               and thinks is nothing, in order to destroy what the world thinks
               is  important.  This  means  that  no  one  can  boast  in  God's
               presence (Cot. 1, 28-29)!

                    Divine  mercy  who  sees  the  sky  and  earth  (Ps.  113,6)
               liked to entrust this pious institute of poor and orphans with
               this  great  treasure,  a  precious  seed,  a  grain  of  mustard,
               which may spread all over the Church witch the blessing of
               the Lord. Thus, the Lord liked to make the children and the
               youths,  the  orphans  and  the  poor  of  this  pious  institute
               understand  the  importance  of  this  divine  words:  «  Pray,
               therefore, etc. »

                    The spirit of this prayer became quickly the spirit of this
               pious  institute  and  formed  its  character,  its  aim,  and  its
               practice.                                                 225

                    It  was  the  turn  of  the  two  little  religious  communities
               leading  the  male  and  the  female  orphanages  to  become
               masters of this sacred patrimony of the Pious Institute of the
               Poor of the Heart of Jesus, to be trustees and guardians, to
               form  the  center  of  this  important  religious  practice,  and  to
               become propagators of it. As in any charitable institution, the
               inmates  who  succeed  each  other  form  the  object,  not  the
               institute;  the  institute  instead,  resides  in  those  who  are
               committed  to  the  mission,  who  are  united  by  the  bond  of
               religious profession through a name, a rule, anal the sacred
               garb.

                    In this pious institute, the two little religious orders take
               the vow to pray every day in order to win the good workers to
               the holy Church in obedience to the most holy Heart of Jesus'
               command.  Both  Rogationists  and  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal
               wear on their chest the sacred red]]></page><page Index="226"><![CDATA[emblem  of  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  along  with  the
               gospel's words: « Pray, therefore,... » (2)

                    In fact, that the two orders are concerned with works of
               charity and beneficence derives legitimately and immediately
               from the mission of the vocation prayer: in fact, if they pray
               continuously  to  win  the  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church,  if
               they follow the wish of the most holy Heart of Jesus through
               his divine command, much greater is the reason they have to
               strive to be good workers themselves. The fulfillment of the
               fourth vow not only engages them to this continuous prayer,
               but  also  binds  them  to  spread  its  spirit  everywhere,  which
               they do by educating orphans and evangelizing the poor, by
               teaching  them  that  the  most  desirable  grace  is  to  obey  the
               command of the most holy Heart of Jesus through the prac-
               tice  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation  (Preface  to  Precious
               Adhesions, 1903).


                                3. HARD ENTERPRISE
                                                                         226
                    Fights  were  pressing  on  every  side,  the  pious  institute
               was  on  the  verge  of  collapse  many  times.  It  seemed  to  be
               dying, but it did not. Encouraging help intervened to keep it
               alive  and  subsistent,  to  test  it  over  and  over  again,  and  to
               make it savor new unexpected pains.

                    The  pious  institute  endured  hardships  for  about  20
               years,  in  spite  of  having  won  many  souls  to  goodness,  of
               having  delivered  many  children  from  depravity,  of  having
               evangelized and helped many poor. Despite the fact that the
               inmates had been praying and presenting petitions every day,
               sometimes even by night; that elect persons had joined the
               two  orders  remedying  the  starter's  failings  (3)  and  that  we
               were  preparing  a  better  future,  the  future  was  still  nothing
               else but a myth, a dream, a]]></page><page Index="227"><![CDATA[hope.  The  present  time  was  always  more  difficult,  more
               entangled, more disheartening.

                    Lo and behold! A resource-idea flashed across the priest
               starter's mind.  This  idea  was  a  child  of a  great  word  of  the
               gospel, a child of a greater, sublime idea, that the Spirit, who
               blows wherever he wishes, instilled into the soul of a spiritual
               youth  many  years  before  the  pious  institute's  birth.  This
               evangelical  revelation,  this  divine  idea,  -  abating  it  is  not
               humility - preceded and escorted the poor priest starter in his
               hard  enterprise.  This  idea  became  the  pious  institute's
               foundation, as the key that opened some treasure of divine
               mercies  and  the  secret  of  the  divine  favors  we  desired  so
               much. Let us declare this great word of the Gospel, this great
               command.

                    The  evangelists  St.  Matthew  and  St.  Luke  report  this
               divine  command  of  Jesus'  Heart's  divine  zeal;  St.  Matthew
               says: « There is a large harvest, but few workers to gather it
               in. Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send workers
               to gather in his harvest » (Mt. 9, 37-38). St. Luke says: « He   227
               said  to  them,  there  is  a  large  harvest,  but  few  workers  to
               gather it in. Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send
               out workers to gather in his harvest » (Lk. 10, 2).

                    A mean paid a special attention to this divine command
               making his debut with it in his carrier (4) even before he had
               read it in the gospel.

                    The priest who knew this divine secret started the pious
               institute in that enclosure of slums, in that corner of Messing
               we  mentioned  above,  giving  the  pious  enterprise  the  chief
               program of practicing perfectly the divine command of Jesus'
               Heart's  divine  zeal,  «  Pray,  therefore...  »    He  gave  those
               abandoned  poor,  who  really  formed  a  flock  without  a
               shepherd,  the  rule  to  pray  in  common  to  the  owner  of  the
               harvest.]]></page><page Index="228"><![CDATA[Listening to the tender voice of those children of the poor
               praying the Evangelical Rogation to win good workers to the
               holy  Church  was  wonderful;  from  that  pitiable  place  the
               prayer raised to heaven, up to the throne of the One who <
               sees  the  sky  and  earth  »  (Ps.  113,  6)  and  «  listens  to  the
               wants of the humble » (Ps. 10, 17).

                    While  that  common  folk  was  catechized  sand  children
               were  educated  and  trained  in  arts  and  crafts,  the  prayer  to
               win  favors  from  the  adorable  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary
               ascended  to  heaven.  We  taught  the  children  saying:  «  My
               dear, we have gathered you for your salvation, but you see
               how many obstacles hinder 'both formation and steadiness of
               these institutions; we, however, have to trust, to serve God, to
               love  Jesus,  and  to  pray  because  we  will  obtain  everything
               through humble, confident, and perseverant prayer. »  As a
               matter of fact, prayer was the nascent institution's continuous
               breath.  Sometimes  we  prayed  even  in  the  night,  keeping
               vigils.

                    We strove to make the people hold the mass in esteem,   228
               teaching them that through the offering of the mass we might
               obtain  any  grace,  because  when  the  divine  victim  is
               immolated  on  the  altar,  the  heavens  unfold  pouring  graces
               down.

                    A person once said: « God's blessings do not yet come
               down  on  this  institute!  »  That  person  meant:  «  God's
               blessings  do  not  yet  come  to  fecundate  and  foster  this
               institute. » From that time the priest starter began longing for
               the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'  fecundating  blessings  like
               Jacob did for his father's blessings.

                    Holy  mass  and  blessings!  Oh!  Who  will  offer  the  holy
               mass so worthily to win all the divine blessings for this pious
               institute?  Is  this  institute  going  to  die?  Besides  attending  to
               the salvation of souls, this institute is perhaps the only one in
               the holy Church that fulfills and]]></page><page Index="229"><![CDATA[makes people fulfill the divine command: « Pray, therefore. .
               » On this ground we could not help trusting in the most holy
               Heart of Jesus for safety.

                    These were the starter's wails and sighs, and to reach
               safety  we  offered  the  daily  mass'  intention  for  such  a
               purpose, declining the offering for other intentions.


                              4. THE RESOURCE-IDEA

                    I  have  said  that  a  happy  resource-idea  flashed  across
               the mind of the pious institute's starter; this idea was a child
               of the evangelical rogation, that is to say, child of the spirit of
               the daily prayer or rogation to win good workers to the holy
               Church.

                    Blessed  by  God,  the  happy  resource-idea  was  born  of
               that priest's following reasoning: the bishops are the persons
               more concerned with the divine words « pray, therefore... »
               because they first need priests sent by God through the Holy   229
               Spirit,  they  are  responsible  for  the  seminaries,  they  are
               greatly  concerned  with  the  seminarians'  becoming  holy
               priests, but they cannot achieve this goal without the prayer
               ordered by Jesus; their means, labor, schools, and industries
               notwithstanding.

                    Consequently,  the  bishops  cannot  help  taking  at  heart
               this pious institute: They cannot deny me a favor when I ask
               them for it. Which favor? A financial help? Never. The Lord's
               works are not founded on money, but on the contempt of it.
               Then,  what  will  I  ask  the  prelates  of  the  holy  Church,  the
               successors  to  the  holy  apostles?  What  does  a  foundation
               need  to  grow  and  develop  for  the  Lord's  glory  and  the
               salvation  of  souls?  Are  there  any  additional  needs  besides
               divine  grace  and  blessings?  Well,  now,  I  will  resort  to  the
               sacred  prelates  of  the  Church  unfurling  before  them  the
               glorious banner of the]]></page><page Index="230"><![CDATA[Evangelical  Rogation,  which  I  have  not  erected  on  highest
               towers,  but  on  the  slums  of  the  poor.  While  kneeling,  I  will
               entreat them to give a pure, spiritual contribution of prayers
               and blessings during the most solemn act of our holy religion,
               during the great sacrifice of the mass. (5)

                    Hardly had I conceived this idea that I put it to work by
               mailing  a  printed  letter  to  the  bishops  of  Sicily,  then  to  the
               bishops of Italy, to the cardinals, and to the superiors general
               of the religious orders. They were told of this pious institute's
               existence having two aims, the primary one at complying with
               the divine command of the sacred Heart of Jesus' divine zeal,
               «  pray  therefore,  »  and  the  other  one  aiming  at  various
               charitable purposes.

                    The  Church's  prelates  were  also  told  that  the  nascent
               foundation  was  on  the  verge  of  death  and  in  need  of  their
               help.  They  were  specifically  entreated  to  become  spiritual
               benefactors  of  the  foundation  for  the  sake  of  the  divine
               command, because the foundation had taken this command
               from our divine Savior's mouth lighting a hearth that should   230
               grow with sacred flames of fervent zeal for the Sacred Heart
               of  Jesus'  interests.  The  Church's  sacred  prelates  were
               entreated  to  give  the  following  four  spiritual  favors  to  the
               nascent institute:

                    1. Once a year and under no obligation of conscience, to
               apply the special fruit of one mass for the spiritual benefit of
               the foundation, that is to say, for its growth in the Lord.

                    2 Every day, at least through a habitual intention, to offer
               this pious institute along with its members, labor, and hopes
               to  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  during  the  elevation  of  the
               ghost.

                    3. Both at the end of the mass and in other occasions]]></page><page Index="231"><![CDATA[while blessing the faithful, to have a mind to bless the pious
               institute along with its members as if they were present and
               kneeling around them.

                    4.  To  join  their  intention  to  the  intention  of  the  pious
               institute's members, who pray every day to win holy priests of
               the Lord from divine mercy.

                    SPIRITUAL RETURNS: after asking the  above spiritual
               favors,  the  pious  institute  promised  to  return  the  following
               ones:

                    1. Monthly masses for the spiritual benefactors, who are
               either alive or dead.

                    2.  A  daily  sprayer  by  the  institute's  orphans,  poor,
               priests, brothers, and sisters for each of the sacred prelates
               and for their intentions.

                    3. While praying to win good workers to the Church, the
               component of the pious institute will apply a special intention   231
               in  favor  of  the  dioceses and  the  seminaries  whose  bishops
               have granted the four spiritual favors.

                    4.  At  the  nevus  of  each  sacred  ally's  death,  the  pious
               institute  will  offer  a  mass  and  a  triduo  of  prayer,  Holy
               Communion,  and  the  rosary  for  the  repose  of  the  spiritual
               benefactor's soul.


                5. SACRED ALLIANCE OF PRIESTS FOR VOCATIONS (6)

                    After mailing this petition to the Church's prelates in the
               name  of  Jesus,  we  received  some  adhesion  letters  so
               expressive  as  to  surpass  any  expectation.  Through  its  high
               representatives, the Church seemed to give a helping hand in
               order to sustain the nascent foundation, pushing it forward in
               the field of the Evangelical Rogation]]></page><page Index="232"><![CDATA[for  its  complete  shaping.  To  the  senders'  great  satisfaction
               the  four  spiritual  favors  were  granted  enthusiastically;  the
               Italian  bishops'  letters  announcing  their  adhesion  are  most
               precious  and  they  are  the  most  delicate  documents  of  the
               pious institute's archive.

                    At  each  arrival  of  precious  adhesions,  we  rang  the
               oratory's  bells  to  give  thanks  to  our  Lord  and  to  the  Virgin
               Mary. If some children were under a punishment, they were
               relieved  from  it  because  that  day  was  a  feast  for  all.  It  is
               praiseworthy  remembering  that  the  spiritual  benefactors
               chose the best dates either of their life or of the ecclesiastical
               year  for  the  celebration  of  the  yearly  mass.  Among  the
               cardinals, Card. Oreglia, dean of the Sacred College, was the
               first to adhere.

                    The  highly  beneficial  effects  on  this  least  grain,  which
               followed the spreading of so many spiritual favors of the holy
               Church were such that the idea of invoking the supreme help
               of prayers and blessing on this pious institute along with its
               components  is  considered  not  a  simple  idea,  but  a  true   232
               inspiration from heaven.

                    Everything  began  blooming,  the  doors  of  divine  prov-
               idence  were  opened,  and  the  vocations  to  the  two  orders
               increased.  Even  the  1908  earthquake,  which  destroyed
               Messina,  put  forward  the  pious  institute  in  the  Italian
               continent, where it flourished with various important houses.

                    We  were  given  St.  Anthony  of  Padua  as  our  most
               special,  prodigious  protector,  and  his  continuous  favors
               compelled  us  to  publish  a  monthly  periodical  for  Italy,
               America, and other foreign countries' benefactors. Thus, the
               humble, nascent, little institute came to the knowledge of the
               people  in  Italy  and  elsewhere.  The  spiritual  help  from  the
               ecclesiastical authorities' prayers and blessings is still visible.
               To have such an admirable spiritual]]></page><page Index="233"><![CDATA[treasure unimpaired and increased, we feel drawn to use all
               means at our disposal.

                    Kneeling before the bishops all over the world, who are
               the  illustrious,  sacred  successors  to  the  apostles,  the
               humblest components of this pious institute of the interests of
               Jesus' Heart implore the four spiritual favors that sustain and
               keep the pious institute alive since it leans on this priceless
               treasure, not an gold, purest gold (Ps. 119, 127). This most
               particular  favor  the  pious  institute's  components  ask  for  the
               sake of the loving Heart of Jesus and for the sacred word «
               pray, therefore,... » etc., which shines on the forehead of the
               holy Church’s least daughters.

                    So  many  sacred  allies  who are  spiritually  united  in  the
               daily prayer to win good workers to the holy Church will make
               this continuous Rogation effective by obtaining from the most
               holy Heart of Jesus the ministers the holy Church desires and
               needs. The continuous blessings will make heaven pour out
               favors on us; the hearth lighting the fire of the Rogation, lying
               down  almost  unknown  in  the  holy  gospels,  will  never  fail;   233
               rather,  it  will  increase  for  the  good  of  the  holy  Church,  for
               society, and for you, in whose benefit we return acceptable
               spiritual favors.

                    Owing  to  so  many  innocent  souls  and  poor  of  Jesus
               Christ as well as to the virgins who pray continuously to the
               Hearts of Jesus and Mary, St. Joseph, and the holy apostles,
               the holy Church's sacred prelates also hope for good results
               for  themselves,  their  dioceses,  and  their  seminaries.
               Otherwise,  why  would  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  have  instilled
               and  recommended,  this  prayer  so  many  rimes  -  the  gospel
               has: he used to say (Precious Adhesions, 1903 and 1921)?
               (7)]]></page><page Index="234"><![CDATA[6. PIOUS UNION OF THE EVANGELICAL ROGATION

                    At  midnight  between  the  19th  and  the  20th  centuries  I
               started a Pious Union of the Evangelical Rogation of Jesus'
               Heart in the church connected with my institutes in Messing;
               my  archbishop,  who  erected  it  canonically,  was  the  first
               charter member.

                    We use the word Rogation from the Latin word Rogate
               which is a command to pray, also conforming to the spirit of
               the Church that commands the rogation days to win spiritual
               and temporal goods. We use the word Evangelical because
               we find this command in the gospel and call it of the Jesus'
               Heart because this prayer is mainly addressed to the same
               divine  Heart  that  recommended  it  and  from  whom  the  holy
               Church expects so great a mercy.

                    This  pious  union  aims  at  spreading  everywhere  this
               prayer  so  appropriate  to  our  times,  hoping  that  it  becomes
               universal rogation in order to win so great a mercy from divine
               goodness.                                                 234

                    Consecrated to the most holy Heart of Jesus, the pious
               union  is  also  entrusted  to  the  Queen  of  the  Apostles,
               Immaculate Mary, whose Immaculate Heart forms one Heart
               with  that  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  It  is  also  under  the
               protection of St. Michael the archangel, St. Joseph, the holy
               apostles, and the holy disciples of the Lord; the holy pontiffs,
               the  holy  founders  of  religious  orders,  and  St.  Anthony  of
               Padua are special patrons.

                    Through His Eminence Card. Gennari I got a rescript by
               the  Sacred  Congregation  of  Rites,  dated  Feb.  6,  1906,  ap-
               proving  the  pious  initiative  and  granting  various  plenary  as
               well as partial indulgences to the members.

                    Women  and  men,  lay people  and  Religious may  share
               this pious union under no obligation of conscience receiving]]></page><page Index="235"><![CDATA[ing the free membership card along with some prayers. The
               members have at heart to pray for good workers to the holy

               the membership card of the P.U.). (8)


                             7. THE ROGATIONIST VERSE

                    On July 11, 1909, I was with the Holy Father Pius X in
               private audience petitioning him to add the following verse in
               the  Litany  of  the  Saint:  «  That  you  send  out  numerous,
               worthy,  and  holy  workers  in  your  harvest...  Lord,  hear  our
               prayer. » His Holiness granted me the favor, benignly writing:
               « Granted according to the petition, when the litany is said in
               the institute. »

                    Given all this, don't you think that it would be a blessing
               of the Lord, a great hope for future vocations for the dioceses,
               if this great command of our Lord Jesus Christ were picked
               up  solemnly  and obeyed  properly by  placing  it  in  the  Major
               Litanies?  In  this  way  the  Church  itself  would  pray  to  win   235
               numerous, holy priests!

                    Please  note  that  our  Lord  gave  this  command  to  the
               teaching  Church  more  than  to  the  learning  Church;  as  a
               matter of fact, the gospel has: He said to his disciples, that is,
               to  the  apostles;  therefore,  it's  up  to  the  Church  to  pray
               formally for this purpose. To reach such a goal the bishops
               should  address  a  petition  to  Jesus  Christ's  supreme  vicar,
               saying that Jesus Christ gave this command to the teaching
               Church.

                    Of course, there would be opposition and opponents as
               there  were  when  new  devotions  and  practices  were
               introduced, as for instance, devotion to the adorable Heart of
               Jesus,  the  most  holy  name  of  Jesus  preached  by  St.
               Bernardine,  and  the  title  Most  Precious  Blood  which  was
               given to the congregation by Blessed Del]]></page><page Index="236"><![CDATA[Bufalo.  Even    the  great  religious  orders  were  opposed.  But
               prevailing  over  the  obstacles,  good  made  its  way  and
               triumphed in the name of Jesus. For instance, the following
               abjection was raised: the Major Litanies are ancient liturgical
               prayers, and it is unsuitable to change them. But even though
               fixed  in  the  dogmas,  the  holy  Church  has  been  always
               adapting itself to worship and liturgy.

                    To how many changes have we witnessed in our times?
               The Loreto Litanies, which are as ancient as the major ones,
               were  increased  with  the  following  verses:  Mother  of  Good
               Counsel,  because  of  the  rash  proceeding  of  society  and
               governments;  Queen  of  Peace,  because  of  the  world  war;
               and earlier, with Queen of the Most Holy Rosary and Queen
               Conceived  without  Original  Sin.  Besides  the  changes
               introduced in the new canon law, the breviary has been also
               reformed, the missal has been given two new prefaces, and
               feasts of first class passed into second class.

                    Well, now, if the holy Church made all these changes by
               her own inspired, prudent initiative, why can't the Church add   236
               to the Major Litanies a new verse for a prayer which has been
               commanded  directly  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  with  these
               words:  «  Pray,  therefore,...  »  etc.?  Why  cannot  the  Church
               adopt the remedy to which our Lord Jesus Christ pointed for
               this desolation, for this depopulated religion of our times?

                    You could also remind the opponents that a new verse
               was  introduced  in  the  Major  Litanies  when  the  Turks
               threatened Italy and other Latin countries. The verse was: «
               That You restrain and bring to nothing the efforts of the Turks
               and  the  heretics,..  Lord,  hear  our  prayer.  »  When  the  risk
               passed  away,  that  verse  was  eliminated  in  the  subsequent
               versions.]]></page><page Index="237"><![CDATA[Are we not in more serious dangers, both spiritual and
               temporal, which require the work of the Lord's priests among

               into the Major Litanies a verse of vocation prayer in order to

                    If  you  have  no  objections  against  my  poor  notes,  but
               agree  that  they  are  based  on  evangelical  truths  and  are  a
               remedy  to  our  gloomy  times,  I  implore  you  to  not  consider
               that  it  was  the  ass  of  Balaam  that  spoke  these  words,
               because the Holy Spirit blows wherever he wishes (Jn. 3, 8)
               and God chose what the world looks down on, and despises,
               and thinks is nothing (1 Cor. 1, 28); I beg you instead to write
               a  fervent  petition  to  the  Holy  Father  Benedict  XV  with  zeal
               and  eloquence,  asking  to  introduce  that  verse  in  the  Major
               Litanies soon after the verse Ut Domnum Apostolicum etc...

                    I  am  mailing  this  paper  to  all  the  bishops  hoping  that
               many of them will send this petition to His Holiness, not only   237
               because of my reasons, but also for even better reasons they
               will  find  in  their  zeal  for  the  Heart  of  Jesus'  interests.  I  beg
               you to be so kind as to let me know of your mailing it to His
               Holiness. I will be very happy if your Secretary sends me a
               copy.

                    It  would  be  helpful  if  good  people  and  observant
               communities of your diocese prayed together with you to the
               most holy Heart of Jesus, his most holy mother, St. Joseph,
               St. Michael the archangel, the holy apostles, the angels and
               the  saints  of  the  diocese,  and  the  illustrious  St.  Anthony  of
               Padua  in  order  that  this  pious,  opportune  enterprise  may
               succeed  for  the  greatest  glory  of  the  most  holy  Trinity,  the
               immense benefit of the holy Church, and the whole world as
               well.]]></page><page Index="238"><![CDATA[8. SUGGESTING A ROGATIONIST PASTORAL

                    If  the  bishops  explained  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  great
               command, « Pray, therefore,... » in the pastoral letter of the
               coming Lent, they would do an excellent work.

                    For that reason I beg you to publish a learned, touching
               pastoral letter about that divine command, proving with zeal
               that it is of great importance to all the people, but mainly to
               the clergy, to pray to the owner of the mystical harvest to call
               elect youths in the cities and the villages so that priests may
               be  formed  by  the  Holy  Spirit,  evil  averted,  and  the  people
               saved from the increasing spiritual and temporal ruin.

                    Your  Excellence  could  conclude  this  very  opportune
               pastoral  letter  by  referring  to  the  pious  union  of  the  Evan-
               gelical  Rogation  of  Jesus'  Heart  and  by  exhorting  your
               faithful,  chiefly  the  clergy, the  pious  souls, the  nuns,  etc.  to
               join such a union. By doing so, you would draw the blessings
               of God on your seminary and the mystical flock.
                                                                         238
                    Oh! If all the bishops did it in their dioceses, the prayer
               that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  commanded  as  the  infallible
               means  to  win  priests  according  to  the  Heart  of  God  would
               become  a  universal  rogation.  It  would  do  a  strong,  sweet
               violence to the most holy Heart of Jesus winning the grace, of
               which the people have become unworthy.

                    Your  Excellence  could  tell  a  pious,  zealous  priest  to
               keep  in  touch  with  me  so  that  I  might  mail  to  him  the
               membership cards for the free enlistment of as many persons
               as possible.

                    The  growth  of  this  prayer  or  evangelical  rogation  of
               Jesus'  Heart  would  be  the  beginning  of  the  papal  favor  to
               insert this prayer in the Major Litanies: it would]]></page><page Index="239"><![CDATA[crown as definitely as solemnly the perfect obedience to the
               great command of the divine zeal of Jesus' Heart! And how
               much the divine Heart would be pleased!

                    Don Rua, the first successor to Don Bosco, once told me
               that  he  was  concerned  with  proposing  and  promoting  the
               insertion  of  a  verse  analogous  to  the  Rogate  in  the  Major
               Litanies,  but  he  couldn't  apply  himself  to  it. Nowadays  time
               presses  more  and  more,  urging  the  universal  obedience  to
               that divine command! (From the letter to the bishops, Jan. 1,
               1920).


                                        NOTES

                   (1)  The Padre was writing on Oct. 10, 1900.

                   (2)  Today,  only  the   Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  are  wearing  the
               external   emblem.

                   (3)  Keep in  mind  that our padre  is  speaking  of  himself.

                   (4)  Here our padre is speaking in third person.      239

                   (5)  In the preface to the  Precious Adhesions published  in 1903,
               our  padre  talks  in  first  person  expressing  some  thoughts  we    deem
               useful   to  refer.  To  begin  with,   he   acknowledges  that  the   original
               idea   of   the   Sacred   Alliance   came   from   the   Madonna,   and
               after touching   upon  the  serious  difficulties   the   institute  was   facing
               he adds:
                   «The elegant, lyric poet Ariel from Brescia, one of the elect group at
               the beginning of our century (our padre was writing on Oct. 14, 1900),
               wrote beautiful verses in honor of the most holy Virgin under (he title of
               Good Counsel. I often called them to my mind when the storm grew so
               furious that I saw no way to escape it. Through those delicate verses I
               exclaimed:
                       As   the   pilgrim  on   his  way  saw  you   clearing
                       The  sky  of  clouds  by  blinking  your eyelash.
                       Mother, clear and save my ship for sailing
                                            Give  me a  lightflash!

                   The most holy Virgin is the great channel through which all the]]></page><page Index="240"><![CDATA[graces, no one excepted in St. Bernard's opinion, come down from
               heaven, because she is in charge of the celestial treasure. We find her
               at the beginning of the human salvation as well as at the head of the
               works and the small or great institutions that rise in the Churoh.
                   I  often  invoked  the  Mother  of  Good  Counsel  confidently,  and  the
               following idea once crossed my mind: this institute absolutely needs a
               divine help. As a matter of fact human help does not fit to the institutions
               that aim at belonging totally to God as well as at working for his glory
               and  the  salvation  of  souls.  I  deeply  felt  the  need  of  the  celestial
               blessings! O God's blessings, how much desirable and how very fecund
               of good you are!
                   I joined these two ideas: I thought of the great sacrifice of the mass
               as of the most effective means to obtain graces, since the victim which
               we offer to the eternal Father is of infinite value. On the other hand (even
               though this institute is the least among the institutions of the holy Church
               and  still  in  the  first  stages),  the  mission  to  pray  in  order  to  win  good
               workers to the holy Church is such that it warmly interests all the faithful,
               each  Christian  having  at  heart  the  good  of  souls,  but  especially  the
               bishops, the shepherds of the mystical flock, those wo are in charge of
               souls, those who are the living apostles of Jesus Ohrist. I concluded that
               no person in the world needs the good workers as much as the bishops;
               therefore,  if  I  appeal  to  their  prayer  demanding  their  blessings  and
               asking them to celebrate one mass in order to attract the divine mercies
               on this little charitable institute, they will not deny it to me.   240
                   This idea was like a ray in the darkness. I seemed to have found
               the secret of the divine mercies.»
                   Touching upon the happy results of this Sacred'Alliance, our padre
               points out: «The blessings and the prayers of the holy Church's prelates
               are  producing  their  good  effects  on  this  pious  institute  and  on  the
               spreading of the vocation prayer. It is a consolation to see our Savior
               Jesus' command being welcomed and obeyed.
                   Several bishops have asked to introduce the vocation prayer book
               in  their  dioceses,  especially  in  the  religious  communities.  The  daily
               recitation  of  such  prayers  in  the  seminaries  is  of  greater  importance,
               because  they  improve  the  culture  of  the  holy  vocations  and  develop
               them as well. Besides attracting divine mercy on their good success. by
               saying  these  daily  prayers  the  clerics  become  more  aware  of  the
               priesthood's importance and mission, finding a practical rule to sanctify
               themselves becoming good evangelical workers for the divine glory and
               the salvation of souls.
                   Not satisfied by their spiritual help through the yearly mass, prayers,
               and daily blessings several bishops from Italy have also]]></page><page Index="241"><![CDATA[joined this pious institute's prayers in order to win good workers to' the
               holy Church by applying their good works and practices of piety to reach this
               goal. »
                   (6)    This   title   was   perhaps   suggested   by   a   previous   priestly
               association  called  Sacred  Alliance at  the Altar,  which    the  S.   Con-
               gregation of the Indulgences endowed with many favors on Aug. 18, 1868. It
               was  formed  in  Palermo  by  a  few  priests  who  wished  to  join  the  Sicilian
               priests  at  the  foot  of  Jesus  Christ's  altar  in  these  most  lamentable  times;
               through  this   union  of    prayer,    they  meant  to  entreat Jesus for our
               wretched    homeland,  for  our    brothers    in    Ireland  and  Poland,  for  those
               ensnared  by    the  error,    for    the  Holy    Father's  triumph,      and      for    the
               Catholic   Church's   exaltation»   (The   Catholic Word, Nov. 15, 1868).
                   (7)      The  Sacred  Alliance  started  with  the  adhesion  of  Mons.  John
               Blandini, bishop of Noto, and has suffered many changes and developments.
               First,  it appealed to 12  bishops in Sicily for the apostolic mass, in honor of
               the holy apostles;  second, it appealed to all the bishops   in   Sicily   and
               later   in   Italy;   third,   it   appealed   to   all   the priests.
                   At the beginning, the requests were three; later, the sacred allies were
               invited to |oin the institute's intentions in the  prayers to win good workers.
               The  intentions  of  the  Sacred  Alliance,  which  has  been  called  Priestly
               Rogationist Crusade, are the following:

                                          DUTIES

                   The members pledge with no obligation of conscience:
                   1)  To offer the divine mass once a year or, at least, a special memento
               (silent prayer during the mass)  to win  many, holy priests.   241
                   2)  To join the Rogationists' daily  prayers and to pray for vocations to
               their  institute.
                   3)  To pray during the mass, at least .through habitual intention, that the
               persons who are called  by the Lord  may  perfectly answer their priestly  or
               religious vocation.
                   4)    To  apply    the    blessings  at    the  end    of  the    mass  or    in    other
               circumstances  to   the  wordly  priesthood,  to   the  benefactors  of  the
               ecclesiastical  vocations,   and  to  the  Rogationist  institutions.

                                     SPIRITUAL  RETURN

                   The Rogationists consider their sacred allies as associates in their spirit
               of prayer, they pledge therefore:
                   1)  To  celebrate  one  holy   mass  a   week  for  the  sacred  allies'
               intentions.
                   2)    To  pray  every  day  for  the  sacred  allies'  sanctification,  for  the
               parishes  and  the  souls  entrusted  to  them,  for  the  dioceses  and  their
               seminaries  as  well    as  for  the    novitiates  and    the    intentions    of    the.
               superiors general who are  sacred allies.]]></page><page Index="242"><![CDATA[3)  To celebrate  holy   masses for the  sacred  allies  as soon  as
               the notice of their death arrives.
                   4)  To   celebrate   perpetual   masses   for   the   dead   sacred
               allies.  In    1960,      our  spiritual    benefactors    were:    cardinals    19;
               bishops  162; priests  1,054.
                   8) To spread the Pious Union, our padre relied on the bishops' zeal.
               In a circular on Oct. 4, 1908, after saying of the Pious Union's existence
               and aim he added:
                   « First, I dare beg your Excellence to make your venerable name
               entered in  the sacred  allies  book  so  that your  clergy  and  faithful  may
               follow your example.
                   Second, I ask your Excellency for permission to introduce this Pious
               Union in your diocese. Later, I will write directly to the pastors or other
               zealous priests or even to pious lay persons.
                   If you would like to let me know the names of pastors or priests or
               other persons, to whom I may write in order to reach greater results, I
               would  have  additional  reasons  to  thank  your  charity.  To  please  you
               more,  I  will  also  inscribe  your  seminarians  as  members  of  the  Pious
               Union so that the most holy Heart of Jesus may form many holy workers
               for your diocese's harvest. »
                   In 1922 our padre mailed another circular, repeating the invitation
               and concluding: « Excellence, I appeal to your great zeal. The matter is
               of the greatest importance for your diocese. For the most loving, sweet
               Heart of Jesus, please introduce this Pious Union in your diocese.   242
                   Your Excellence may erect the Pious Union in a church of yours or
               you may make me enter into correspondence with one of your zealous
               priests to make things go on. I will mail membership cards along with all
               is required, the stamps for the mail included. God and everything. »
                   A warm invitation to the Catholic editors to spread the prayer for the
               good  workers  as  well  as  to  invite  the  people  to  join  the  Pious  Union
               traces back to before the 1908 earthquake: « Here and there the people
               begin feeling the need to obey the divine command, « Pray, therefore, to
               the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in His
               harvest»  (Ml.  9,  38  -  Lk.  10,  2).  Various  periodicals  are  concerning
               themselves  with  spreading  this  prayer  in  order  to  win  numerous,  holy
               priests to the holy Church from the owner of the mystical harvest. Such
               prayers begin appearing here and there.
                   Because  it  is  30 years since  I began concerning myself  with  this
               aim through new institutions, prayers, prayer books, periodicals, and a
               universal  Pious  Union  which  has  been  approved  and  provided  with
               indulgences  by  the  Holy  See,  I  ask  you  to  concern  yourself  with  it
               through your excellent periodical or newspaper, for the Lord's]]></page><page Index="243"><![CDATA[glory  and  the  good  of  souls.  I  submit  some  periodicals  to  you  in
               Older  that  you  may  realize  the  progress  we  have  made  in  this  ad-
               vertisement as  well as  how  bishops,  archbishops,  cardinals, superiors
               general of religious orders, and popes have received and promoted it.
                   However, we work hard to spread it, and I warmly recommend K to
               your zeal. For the sake of the most holy Heart of Jesus, please help the
               periodicals  that  I am mailing  to  you; advertise  them  in your  periodical
               and  invite  the  people  to  join  the  universal  Pious  Union  that  is  free  of
               charge and lays no obligation of conscience upon the people.
                   When  this  prayer  that  Jesus  Christ  commanded  is  spread  in  the
               holy Church, much good will come to the nations. In fact, the secret of
               the Church and society's salvation is dependent on the priests of God
               and on the new zealous apostles of charity that divine mercy will send
               out! How can God deny our request when he himself commanded us to
               pray for it? Our disregard for it till now is the cause of such a pitiable lack
               of elect workers in the mystical harvest!...
                   If  you  concern  yourself  with  this  holy  advertisement,  you  will
               deserve  a  great  reward  because  your  advertisement  will  raise  new
               apostles who will operate a great deal of good in the holy Church, which
               will be your crown of inconceivable glory in the kingdom of heaven!»
                   Our padre had also begun an advertisement or Rogationist crusade

               convent was hurt by the proposal as if it were a change to its rules or
               traditions. It is understood that those good Religious had not understood   243

               objection, however, was dropped soon after when Pius XI introduced the

                                  RELIGIOUS VOWS

                    I acknowledge that the essence of the religious life
               consists  in  the  three  vows  of  poverty,  obedience,  and
               chastity.



                                   1. PREPARATION

                       Each  religious  community  is  based  on  the  perfect
               observance  of  the  three  evangelical  -counsels:  poverty,
               obedience,  and  chastity.  If  divine  mercy  grants  this  Pious
               Institute of the Poor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus the grace to
               form a religious community, the profession and observance of
               the  three  vows  mentioned  above,  called  evangelical
               counsels, will 'be after the postulate.
                    To  become  worthy  to  profess  the  rule  and  the  three   245
               vows,  the  probationers  must  accustom  themselves  to
               practicing  the  virtues  of  perfect  chastity,  free  poverty,  and
               exact  obedience  beginning  with  the  time  of  entrance.  Even
               though they do not take the vows by entering the postulate,
               still  they  have  to  embrace  these  virtues  by  resolving  or
               proposing the practice of them (P.R.P.).

                       To  prepare  themselves  to  the  religious  profession,
               the youths will pay careful attention to adorn their soul with
               holy  virtues,  especially  charity,  humility,  immaculate  purity,
               perfect  obedience,  meekness  and  gentleness,  patience,
               modesty,  and  perseverance.  They  will  love  seclusion,
               recollection,  prayer,  meditation,  spiritual  reading,  holy  talk,
               silence, and the practice of being in the]]></page><page Index="246"><![CDATA[divine presence Candid and sincere, they will do everything
               with pure intention, offering  themselves as victims to Jesus,
               our supreme goodness (Speech, Sept. 4, 1909).

                       The  Little  Retreat  novices  will  nurture  in  their  heart
               the longing to take the religious vows of chastity, obedience,
               poverty, and a fourth vow that is so dear to God in order  to
               belong  totally  to  Jesus  and  to  help  the  people.  In  the
               meantime they will accurately practice the virtues concerning
               the vows they hope to profess when the merciful God allows
               it, being aware that they cannot be worthy of doing it, unless
               they  observe  the  virtues  for  a  conventional  period  of  time
               (R.L.P.).

                    Dearest  daughters,  I  exhort  you  to  draw  yourselves
               closer to our beloved Jesus Christ, our supreme goodness, to
               grow in his love, to desire to love him, and to have pity on his
               Heart's pains consoling him through your fervent practice of
               holy virtues. Please renew your resolutions, starting a new life
               with humility, mortification, obedience, and prayer in order to
               prepare  yourselves  to  pronounce  the  vows  and  to  commit   246
               yourselves to the service of God. Please light the wise virgins'
               lamp because the groom is about to come together with his
               mother, the most holy Mary. Look at this great mother and at
               the glorious Patriarch St. Joseph so that your upright wishes
               may  be  fulfilled  through  their  powerful  intercession  (Letter,
               July 2, 1888).

                    The Religious will take the vows of chastity, poverty, and
               obedience  in  the  presence  of  this  pious  institute's  director.
               Because  this  little  order  stands  far  the  sacred  banner
               announcing  the  evangelical  motto  «Pray,  therefore,  to  the
               owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in
               his harvest,» the congregants will also take the fourth vow of
               the daily prayer which aims at winning good workers to the
               holy Church (P.R.P.).]]></page><page Index="247"><![CDATA[2. THE PROFESSION

                    What  is  a  vow?  It  is  a  resolute  promise  to  God  to
               perform a possible and higher good for God's glory and for
               our perfection. This is the theology's definition we are going
               to look into.

                       A  promise to  God.  When  a  person promises  some-
               thing, he honors the person to whom he promises by showing
               love  and  respect  or  by  acknowledging  his  duty  of
               thanksgiving and subjection. As by keeping his promise, he
               confirms his love, respect, thanksgiving, and subjection, so by
               breaking his word, he denies love, respect, thanksgiving, and
               the subjection to which he was bound. When a person makes
               the promise he seems to say: I esteem, respect, honor, and
               love you, therefore I make a promise to show such feelings;
               on the contrary, when he breaks his word he seems to say: I
               do not esteem, respect, honor, and love you because when I
               made  the  promise,  I  cheated  you.  This  is  meant  by  the
               promise's  non-execution.  Besides,  the  more  the  person  to
               whom we promise is noble and worthy, the more our offence   247
               is grave when we break our word.

                    To  whom  do  the  people  make  the  religious  vow?  To
               God!  When  a  Religious  takes  the  vows,  he  acknowledges
               God  as  the  Lord  to  whom  he  must  be  subject,  as  the
               benefactor he has to thank, as the holy of the holiest he has
               to honor through the practice of the virtues. On the contrary,
               when  a  Religious  breaks  his  ward,  he  denies  God  as  the
               Lord, benefactor, supreme goodness, and the holiest!

                    Resolute promise. What does the vow imply? A strictest
               observance of it. Before taking the vows freely, the Religious
               meditated a year upon it preparing himself through retreat to
               make  a  free  decision.  Therefore,  his  breaking  off  has  no
               excuse.]]></page><page Index="248"><![CDATA[A  possible  and  higher  good.  The  condition  that  the
               vow  must  be  possible  and  better  than  its  contrary  is  in-
               dispensable for the vow's validity. This doctrine drives us to
               consider  these  sublime  topics:  what  we  have  promised  is
               better than its contrary, chastity is better than conjugal status,
               poverty  Is  better  than  possessing,  obedience  is  better  than
               living free.

                       For His glory. This is the vow's chief aim. By observ-
               ing the vows, the Religious glorifies God! Yes! By doing so,
               he  acknowledges  God  before  the  world,  acknowledges  the
               religious truths, and increases the worship to God by winning
               souls to him.

                       For  our  perfection.  The  vows'  second  aim  is  our
               sanctification. Our observing them helps us to reach this goal,
               because  the  vows  are  the  turning  point  of  the  religious  life
               (Speech, May 10, 1908).

                       Before  taking  the  holy  vows,  please  consider  that
               they are so important as to make you indebted toward God,   248
               your  transgressions  heavier,  and  you  yourselves  obliged  to
               give  a  strict  account  of  them.  Not  taking  the  vows  is  better
               than  taking  them  with  levity  or  without  a  resolute  mind  to
               observe them. Dearest children, please consider the step you
               are  going  to  take.  If  you  feel  yourselves  unprepared  or
               unwilling, you can go black to the place of the novices with
               holy caution.

                       But if you feel drawn by pure, holy intention to resolu-
               tely  bind  yourselves  to  Jesus  through  the  vows  of  chastity,
               poverty, and obedience, please take your vows with a steady
               mind  of  observing,  renewing  them  every  year,  and
               persevering until you take them for ever through the perpetual
               profession.  By  professing  you  bind  yourselves  to  the
               observance of the constitutions and the rules, as well as to
               the meaning, degree, and circumstances that they foresee.]]></page><page Index="249"><![CDATA[My  dearest  children,  now  let  us  adore  our  Lord  in  the
               Holy Sacrament imploring from the divine Heart of Jesus, the
               Immaculate Heart of Mary, your angels and saints the divine
               help you need so much in this important moment of your life
               (Speech, Oct. 12, 1910).

                       Renewing the vows is of a great importance. Like a
               boat leaving the harbor and going toward the open sea, our
               soul  is  leaving  the  world,  going  deeply  into  the  sea  of  all
               goods, which is the religious life, in order to be closer to Gad.
               Let us consider the two extremes: the world we leave and the
               God we are about to join. By doing so, we will appreciate the
               regular  life  nurturing  gratitude,  and  fervor  as  well  (Speech,
               1902).

                       Daughters, what is the liturgy we have performed for
               you? What is the step you have undertaken? In the presence
               of Jesus in the Holy Sacrament, you have taken the perpetual
               vows throughout the  formalities of the religious service; you
               have  given  up  yourselves  to  God  through  the  vows  of
               poverty, chastity, and obedience. But, did you think of it? Did   249
               you consider that you have renounced both your freedom and
               will  for  ever,  that  you  have  bound  yourselves  to  the  will  of
               others  that  you  have  given  up  your rights  over  things?  Oh!
               Why didn't you come back to the world? Why didn't you think
               of  seeking  new  affections,  good  opportunities  of  fun,  and
               freedom in the world?

                       I feel that you are saying: father, we left the world for
               ever to surrender to Jesus; through the vows, we have lost no
               freedom; on the contrary, we feel ourselves freer!

                       You are right! Happy you, who are given this under-
               standing  by  the  Lord!  Religious  profession  is  the  consum-
               mation and the fulfillment of the spiritual wedding between]]></page><page Index="250"><![CDATA[Jesus  and  the  soul:  it  is  the  topmost  of  the  ascensions
               (Speech, March 30, 1919).

                       Consecrating oneself to God is a holiest religious act
               which gives a greatest glory and happiness to a creature on
               earth.  Consecrating  oneself  to  God!  The  things  which  are
               consecrated to God are sacred (Speech, May 5, 1912)!


                          3. THROUGH ST. JOSEPH'S HANDS

                       Brothers, sisters, and children in Jesus Christ, today
               is  a  double  solemnity  for  us  because  we  are  honoring  St.
               Joseph by renewing our vows.

                       This holy patriarch is the protector and patron of all,
               but  chiefly  of  those  who  embrace  religious  life.  Professing
               every year on St. Joseph's patronage feast makes us happily
               hope  to  achieve  his  help  in  order  to  observe  the  vows
               perfectly, imitating him, who is our model (Speech, 1906).
                                                                         250
                       It has been since a few years that we gather on St.
               Joseph's feast to renew our vows. This day has been always
               dear,  memorable,  and  holy  for  us  because  we  have  taken
               breathe under the auspices of the Church's patron (Speech,
               1910).


                       4. ...AND UNDER THE MADONNA'S CLOAK

                       How  will  we  dare  belong  to  Jesus  through  holy
               profession? We are frightened by simply thinking of it! Owing
               to  his  most  holy  Heart's  infinite  goodness,  however,  out  of
               love  Jesus  does  not  look  at  a  soul's  failings!  Sweetest
               mother,  if  Jesus  wants  us,  please  purify  our  soul  with  new
               grace, clothing us with new virtues under your]]></page><page Index="251"><![CDATA[motherly care. Make us share in your innocence, infuse in us
               a bit of our inexpressible humility, and instill part of the divine
               love  that  is  burning  in  your  Immaculate  Heart.  O  beautiful
               Immaculate Mary, take us to the mystical wedding with Jesus,
               our  supreme  goodness;  if  we  are  accompanied  by  you,  we
               won’t die by confusion in his presence, his clemency instead
               will bend toward us. If your divine Son along with you wants
               us  to  profess,  oh,  win  from  his  most  holy  Heart  so  much
               grace as to make us his slaves of love from now on, make us
               his  everlasting  faithful  by  imitating  his  divine  virtues,  by
               observing  the  religious  rules,  by  seeking  the  last  place  for
               ourselves, and by fostering his honor, glory, consolation, and
               interests. May we accomplish it especially through the daily
               prayer to win good workers to the holy Church, through our
               continuous work and sacrifice for the salvation of souls, and
               the relief of the poor (From a petition, May 7, 1917).


                       5. HOW TO OBSERVE OUR FOUR VOWS

                       We  can  observe  chastity  through  prayer,  holy   251
               thoughts,  mortification,  Communion,  devotion  to  Mary,  St.
               Louis,  the  saints  as  well  as  by  humility  and  avoidance  of
               idleness.

                       We observe poverty through detachment, care of little
               things,  the  monthly  examination,  and  penance  such  as
               abstinence from comfort and food.

                       We observe obedience by trying to lose our own will
               and by blind, ready, joyous, and supernatural obedience.

                       Vow  of  obedience  to  our  Rogate.  What  a  beautiful
               obedience is this one! It joins us directly with our Lord Jesus
               Christ! He founded our order! I do not dwell on]]></page><page Index="252"><![CDATA[its importance and goods, but I say this only: let us obey by
               praying and by encouraging the people to pray to win good
               evangelical workers (Speech, May 10, 1908)!

                                     A. POVERTY

                       As  far  as  I am  concerned  with  poverty,  I  declare  to
               hold  it  as  the  most  precious  pearl, as  the foundation  of  my
               vocation  and  of  the  institute's  existence.  By  consecrating
               myself to this institute I mean to commit myself with transport
               of love to poverty, contemplating it in our adorable Lord Jesus
               Christ, the most holy Virgin, and the saints who practiced it
               with holy enthusiasm.

                       I  will  hold  it  as  the  fountain  of  priceless  celestial
               treasures, knowing that until this institute is evangelically poor
               and  glories  in  poverty,  it  will  stand  firm  and  unshakeable,
               improving day by day. But if it grows weak in the practice of
               holy  poverty,  it  will  go  to  ruin,  ending  as  so  many  religious
               communities have done before.
                                                                         252
                       So, I will be most attentive to avoid offence against
               holy  poverty  as  well  as  to  give  bad  example,  which  could
               make others vacillate in such a vital religious virtue and vow.
               When  the  people  dispute  or  discuss  or  interpret  the  rules,
               with  God's  help  and  my  own  will  I  promise  to  favor  the
               strictest theory about the evangelical poverty's observance. In
               practice,  I  promise  to  embrace  holy  poverty  in  all  its
               manifestations, and specifically:

                       1.     Until this institute's rules concede the radical
               possession  on  one's  own  property,  I  will  hold  it  with  holy
               detachment,  ready  to  renounce  it  when  this  order's  chapter
               and the superior authority will compel to do so. (1)

                       2.     I  will  hold  back  nothing  from  my  capital's
               profit, but will hand over everything to the superiors, empower]]></page><page Index="253"><![CDATA[ing them even to cash, if they ask for it. Likewise I will quickly
               turn over all stipends of masses, preaching, and alms to the
               superiors.

                       3.     I  will  retain  no  room,  furniture,  clothes,
               clothing  and  anything  else  as  mine;  on  the  contrary  I  will
               receive  everything  from  the  institute  as  out  of  charity;
               therefore I will never say: my room, my clothes, my objects; I
               will say instead: the room where I dwell, the objects I use.

                       4.     I  promise  to  love  holy  poverty  for  my  Lord
               Jesus  Christ,  who  was  poor  and  suffering.  While  lacking
               something I cannot have, I will conform and suffer in peace
               rejoicing in my use of the poor things such as the room, the
               clothes, the bed, the food, and anything else.

                       5.     I will always pray to the Lord to give me the
               spirit of holy poverty.


                             1. MOST PRECIOUS VIRTUE                     253

                       Poverty  is  a  most  precious  virtue  the  Son  of  God
               embraced  for  our  sake  and  example.  This  divine  virtue  is
               completely  unknown  to  the  world,  which  considers  the  rich
               people  happy,  whereas  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  threatened
               them, but said to the have-nots: happy the poor.

                       The perfect observance of poverty enriches the soul
               with  every  good.  It  creates,  keeps,  and  strengthens  the
               communities.  In  fact,  even  the  most  flourishing  religious
               communities decline and fail for lack of poverty's observance!
               Because of that, the probationers are warmly recommended
               to observe holy poverty. They will have nothing of their own,
               but  everything  will  be  in  common;  they  will  keep  no  thing
               secretly,  they  will  make  no  gift  or  loan,  but  will  give  their
               boxes' key to the superiors.]]></page><page Index="254"><![CDATA[Having  nothing  is  not  enough  for  the  probationers;
               they  must  be  also  detached  from  the  desire  of  owning,
               embracing the poverty's inconveniences about clothes, food,
               dwelling,  and  bearing  any  want  for  God's  sake.  The
               probationers  will  glory  in  this  precious  evangelical  pearl,
               saying:  We  seem  to  have  nothing,  yet  we  really  possess
               everything (2 Cor. 6, 10) (P.R.P.). (2)

                       The  Little  Retreat  novice  will  nurture  a  particular
               affection  and  a  tender,  strong  love  toward  the  holy  evan-
               gelical  poverty.  Each  novice  will  strive  to  love  poverty  as
               much  as  the  world  strives  to  love  riches.  Since  the  world
               loves riches with a predominant passion, without getting tired
               in growing rich or in buying the most it can, so the Little Poor
               of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  will  love  holy  poverty  with  a
               predominant  transport  and  will  be  never  satisfied  but
               becoming always more poor, surrendering all that is surplus
               and detaching her heart from earthly things more and more
               (R.L.P.). (3)

                       Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  preached  holy  poverty  by   254
               divine words, but above all by example. He became poor to
               such a degree that he had no place where to rest his head.
               For that reason evangelical poverty is a precious treasure for
               the  people  who  love  Jesus  Christ,  who  said:  «  Happy  are
               those  who  know  they  are  spiritually  poor;  the  kingdom  of
               heaven  belongs  to  them  »  (Mt.  5,  3)!  The  saints  loved  this
               sublime  virtue of  poverty  with  tender  transport.  The  more  a
               soul  dispossesses  herself,  renouncing  everything  for  God's
               sake, the more God fulfills her with himself, and he becomes
               her  treasure.  To  achieve  everything,  one  must  lose
               everything.

                       To  be  always  fond  of  holy  poverty,  each  Little  Poor
               novice  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  will  look  at  her  divine
               model saying to herself: « I entered the novitiate to find Jesus
               only, but he is poorest; so, if I want Jesus]]></page><page Index="255"><![CDATA[only I have to embrace him along with his holy poverty ». The
               Little Poor novice will also look at the examples of the most
               holy Virgin and of the saints (R.L.P.).

                       Reading  books  and  listening  to  speeches  which
               foster love of holy poverty improves one's love for it. The con-
               gregants  will  meditate  an  the  divine  model  Jesus  Christ  as
               well as on the most holy Virgin and the saints, especially on
               St. Francis of Assisi and St. Joseph Labre's  poverty without
               feeling ashamed of appearing poor for the glory of our Lord
               Jesus Christ's poverty. They, however, will always be clean in
               appearance and attire (C.R.).


                               2. FEAR OF SLACKENING

                       Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  and  Little  Poor  of  Jesus'
               Heart,  be  lovers  and  observers  of  holy  poverty,  but  fear
               slackening,  because  many  religious  orders  that  were  once
               flourishing like trees full of years in the holy Church became
               parched  and  failed  in  short  time  after  they  broke  from  holy   255
               poverty! Slackening came about, and the order went to ruin!
               Many  great  convents  and  monasteries  once  flourishing  with
               saints,  now  are  profane  houses  or  places  of  sin  and
               blasphemies,   because    the   communities   neglected
               evangelical  poverty!  God  stopped  favoring  'those  loose
               orders; the holy founders acknowledged them as their own no
               longer, so they ended! The enemy passed through the broken
               poverty as a furious winner putting everyone to the edge of
               his sword, heaping ruin!

                       Institutes  rise,  progress,  and  expand  wonderfully
               when  they  are  based  on  the  observance  of  evangelical
               poverty. God blesses such institutes abundantly, the adorable
               Jesus  Christ  acknowledges  them  as  his  own,  because  he
               embraced  holy  poverty  as  his  heart's  delight  loving  both  its
               inconveniences and want. The most holy]]></page><page Index="256"><![CDATA[Virgin  becomes  owner,  mother,  superior,  and  provider  of
               these  communities,  which  grow  rich  with  celestial  goods
               having  everything  necessary  to  life.  So  they  can  say:  «We
               seem to have nothing, yet we really possess everything » (2
               Cor. 6, 10) (P.C.Z.).

                       To be truly poor, the Little Poor of Jesus' Heart not
               only  wishes  nothing  sumptuous  and  vainglorious,  but  also
               maintains her heart free from even the affection to the poor,
               necessary things. To better reach such a goal, at the renewal
               of the yearly vows and promises as well as when it is handy
               during  the  year,  she  will  make  an  affective  arid  effective
               renunciation.

                       To become truly poor, each sister will receive every-
               thing out of charity such as the room, food, clothes, and even
               water  holding  herself  worthy  of  nothing,  even  though  she
               works in benefit of the institute. So that the sisters may have
               nothing  of  their  own  they  will  live  together,  as  much  as
               possible avoiding saying: my room, my clothes, and the like;
               they will say instead: the room where I dwell, the clothes I am   256
               wearing.

                       To  be  truly  poor  in  spirit,  they  will  have  no  worry
               about flood, clothes, and anything else, but will rest trustful in
               the  divine  providence's  hands,  sure  that  till  they  seek  God
               alone  no  thing  necessary  to  their  subsistence  will  fail
               according  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  infallible  words:  «  Be
               concerned above everything else with His kingdom and with
               what He requires, and He will provide you with all these other
               things » (Mt. 6, 33) (R.L.P.).


                         3. LET US REMEMBER OUR ORIGINS

                    For  holy  poverty's  sake  each  sister  will  avoid  keeping
               even the least thing secretly, or by negligence, such as books
               or images or objects of devotion, because]]></page><page Index="257"><![CDATA[receiving or keeping a little thing, even indifferently, gives way
               to  the  devil  who  would  want  you  to  delight  in  and  later
               become attached to it. Then new possession will increase, as
               will your attachment, so that the spirit of holy poverty goes to
               ruin! Holy poverty requires that each be detached from room,
               place, clothes, and everything.

                       To  feel  ashamed  for  wearing  a  poor  or  mended  or
               faded dress as well as warn shoes offends holy poverty. May
               God, Immaculate Mary, the angels, and the saints bless that
               sister  who  is  fond  of  wearing  poor  clothes and  worn  shoes
               even in public.

                       The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal's  origin  was  in  Mes-
               sina's most abject, poor place, the most miserable beggars'
               center  of  pitiable,  crumbling  slums.  It  was  there  that  the
               sisters  were  given  their  first  glorious  name of  Little  Poor  of
               Jesus'  Heart.  By  always  remembering  their  origin  and  by
               keeping in mind that each house must have a mark of their
               primal poverty as much as possible, the sisters will be worthy
               of  such  a  precious,  honorable  name;  therefore  let  furniture,   257
               accessories, refectory, and everything be poor; even though
               sufficient, let the food be poor and simple.

                       For the Daughters of Divine Zeal, true love and glory
               of  poverty  consist  in  bearing  joyously  its  inconveniences,
               want, and humiliation (F.R.).

                       The Daughters of Divine Zeal will pay careful atten-
               tion to the holy writers teaching that the persons really poor in
               spirit  are  fond of  poverty's  inconveniences;  for  instance,  St.
               Francis  of  Sales  says  that  desiring  the  comforts  of  riches
               along with the honors of poverty is too ambitious; therefore,
               the sisters will hold themselves happy and privileged by God
               when  they  suffer  want  and  inconvenience  in  the  matter  of
               food, dwelling, and everything (L.C.).]]></page><page Index="258"><![CDATA[Possessing  nothing  is  not  enough  for  a  sister  to  be
               really  poor  in  spirit;  but  she  must  be  also  ready  and
               determined  to  even  renounce  a  kingdom  for  the  poverty  of
               Jesus Christ, who became poor for us!

                       Daughter of Divine Zeal, mold your heart through this
               sublime disposition, and you will be holy! The divine lover will
               accept  your  disposition  as  if  you  had  really  renounced  a
               kingdom  along  with  its  earthly  glory  for  his  sake!  He  will
               enrich you on earth with his celestial treasures making you a
               queen  of  the  eternal  kingdom  along  with  its  infinite  glory  in
               heaven!  Perfect  poverty  is  poverty  in  spirit,  which  refuses
               effectively not only all the world, but also requires detachment
               from useful, necessary things, from spiritual pleasure in order
               to  seek  God  alone,  together  with  His  pure  will.  It  'is  this
               spiritual nudity which forms the union of love between Jesus
               and the soul (F.R.).

                             4. POVERTY AND ECONOMY

                       This  institute  will  usually  earn  its  means  of   258
               subsistence by work. The articles produced will be sold at the
               right price avoiding bargaining as much as possible (L.C).

                       The  great  religious  virtue  of  poverty  requires  that
               good  care  be  taken  of  the  provisions,  doing  everything
               without  unnecessary  expenses  or  with  a  minimum  of
               expense. Attention must be also paid to prevent deterioration
               because  a  minor  waste  offends  the  virtue  or  the  vow  of
               poverty (L.C).

                       The  mother  superiors  will  avoid  spending  unneces-
               sary money for the community's maintenance, remembering
               that they have taken the vow of poverty, that they must use
               (and not abuse) the divine providence's affluence, otherwise
               they offend our Lord, stopping him from]]></page><page Index="259"><![CDATA[helping  us.  The  community  must  be  provided  with  the
               necessary food, clothes, furniture, accessories, etc., avoiding
               the surplus. (4)

                       Exception  to  saving  and  economy  are  the  following
               cases:  the  furniture  of  our  churches  and  oratories  and  the
               relieving of the sick people in our institutes, orphanages, and
               asylums.  The  mother  superiors  will  behave with  generosity,
               sacrifice, faith, and love toward Jesus in the Holy Sacrament;
               however, for expenses going beyond 300 liras (5) they have
               to ask the permission from the general council, which will be
               generous  with  God's  house  decorum,  if  the  recurring
               community  has  the  money.  To  heal  and  relieve  the  sick
               people, everything must be done with generosity, charity, and
               according to the means at disposal (S.D.D.Z.).


                                    B. OBEDIENCE

                       As to holy obedience, I declare that thus virtue forms
               the  life  and  the  existence  of  all  religious  institutes.  As  the   259
               natural order subsists because the elements obey the laws of
               divine will (should they disobey, the cosmos would end in a
               moment),  so  a  religious  house  subsists  through  faithful,
               perfect  obedience;  should  obedience  fail,  the  natural  and
               supernatural means for its existence would end.

                       I acknowledge that holy obedience is a virtue leading
               to perfect sanctification and to union with God, because the
               people  accomplish  God's  will  perfectly  by  obeying  the
               superiors along with the rules. Obedience is also the surest,
               safest,  and  shortest  way  to  reach  great  perfection,  and  a
               religious  house  where  all  the  people  obey  religiously  is  a
               kingdom  of  God  on  earth.  Humble  obedience  is  perfect
               imitation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who]]></page><page Index="260"><![CDATA[always proclaimed to do his Father's will up to the death on
               the  cross;  by  doing  so,  the  obedient  person  transforms
               himself into Jesus Christ.

                       Disobedience,  instead,  makes  the  people  resemble
               Lucifer,  who  said:  «I  will  not  serve».    If  prohibited  by
               obedience,  even  the  good  actions  became  bad,  While  the
               most indifferent ones became worthy of great merit when they
               are accomplished by obedience. Always bearing in mind the
               Holy Spirit's saying « the speech of the obedient will always
               be  heard,»  I  will  strive  with  all  my  strength  to  obey  my
               superiors, the rules, and the constitutions.
                       That my obedience be in the Lord and useful to my-
               self as well as to the 'institute, I declare:

                       1. From now an, I renounce unreservedly my will at
               the  hands  of  my  superiors  following  the  hierarchical
               competence.
                       2. I will not be obstinate in my judgment and opinion;
               on  the  contrary,  by  obeying  exteriorly  I  also  intend  to  obey
               interiorly, conforming my judgments and points of view to the   260
               superiors judgments and points of view.
                       3. I promise to obey for supernatural reasons such as
               pleasing the Sacred Heart of Jesus, setting good example to
               others, seeing Jesus Christ in the superiors, and obeying for
               Gads sake. I promise such obedience not only in the things I
               like,  but  also  in  those  I  dislike,  keeping  in  mind  that  such
               obedience is meritorious and that we win the kingdom of God
               by subjugating ourselves.

                       4. My obedience will be ready never delaying for any
               reason; joyous, having internal and external pleasure, at least
               in  the  will,  because  «  God  delights  in  the  people  who  give
               with  joy  »  ;  exact,  accomplishing  the  superiors'  command
               entirely  and  conforming  my  judgment  and  will  to  theirs;
               simple, without changing the orders by]]></page><page Index="261"><![CDATA[reasoning;  faithful  and  constant,  obeying  the  orders,  the
               constitutions, and the rules without delay and disregard.

                       5. At last, I declare to do everything by obedience; for
               instance, if I have to go out or eat or drink between meals or
               receive people or leave out some rule or anything else, I will
               ask  the  permission  from  the  superior  each  time  or  every
               month.  As  to  the  receiving or  writing  letters  or  messages,  I
               will do so through the superiors.

                       I will pray every day to the adorable Heart of Jesus to
               make me a perfect obedient Religious (C.R.).


                         1. OBEDIENCE: LIFE OF THE ORDER

                       Since without obedience no religious order can stand,
               obedience  must  be  regarded  by  the  congregants  as  the
               order's  life.  Distinguishing  between  the  observance  of  the
               vow and the observance of the virtue of obedience, by vow
               the  congregants  must  obey  the  superiors  in  everything   261
               concerning the institute and its rules. They are bound to obey
               in minor things under light obligation of conscience, but when
               the command is given explicitly under precept of obedience,
               they are bound to obey under grave obligation of conscience.
               As to the virtue of obedience, the congregants will hold that
               they  cannot  be  good  Religious  without  obedience,  because
               love  of  God,  zeal  for  the  divine  glory,  humility,  chastity,
               poverty, charity, and vocation fail without it. Their chief care,
               therefore, will be becoming victims of holy obedience, mindful
               of our Lord Jesus Christ who was obedient up to the death.
               They will glory in depending on other's mind for everything,
               striving to make their obedience -ready - joyous - exact - for
               supernatural  reason  -  seeing  God  in  the  person  who  is
               commanding. This way, the]]></page><page Index="262"><![CDATA[soul will quickly reach the most perfect union with God (C.R).
               (6)

                       Obedience  is  the  fundamental  virtue  of  a  religious
               community, which cannot exist without it. Through obedience
               the  Religious  soon  becomes  holy,  mortifies  her  passions,
               becomes dearest to the Lord, and keeps herself safe from the
               devil,  the  world,  and  her  own  selfishness,  While  also
               achieving  the  other  virtues.  The  Religious  who  is  perfectly
               subdued  to  obedience,  enjoys  great  peace  along  with
               freedom of spirit, and the more she seems tied, the more she
               is free. Putting herself in the hands of the Lord as malleable
               wax to be shaped as he wants, the obedient Religious will be
               Jesus Christ's spouse because he was obedient to his Father
               up to the death for our sake (C.D.D.Z.). (7)

                       Jesus Christ and the most holy Virgin are the perfect
               models of perfect obedience. Next follow the examples of the
               saints  who  esteemed  obedience  more  than  raptures  and
               miracles. The holy writers say that it is better performing an
               act of obedience than having the power of reviving the dead,   262
               and the saints prefer obedience to the greatest penance and
               to  the  holy  works.  As  sin  came  into  the  world  by
               disobedience,  so  the  virtues  enter  the  souls  by  obedience
               making  them  pleasant  to  God.  Therefore,  the  community
               practicing perfect obedience is a community of angels.

                       To  fully  appreciate  this  virtue,  we  notice  that  God
               holds obedience as preferable to his orders, as we know from
               the  people  who  experienced  that  in  supernatural  ways.  For
               instance,  St.  Veronica  Giuliani  was  told  by  the  most  holy
               Virgin, You will not say « I always want to do God's will and
               holy  obedience,  »  but  will  say  «  l  always  want  to  do  holy
               obedience and God's will » (C.D.D.Z.).

                       The aspirant will nurture a great love for obedience,]]></page><page Index="263"><![CDATA[knowing that this virtue is the shortest way to reach holiness
               and  that  people  reach  their  goal  safely  by  living  under
               obedience.  Since  God  delights  much  in  the obedient  souls,
               He  blesses  them  with  special  graces  making  them  always
               succeed; on the contrary, the disobedient ones are like a boat
               without  rudder  never  reaching  the  harbor  because  God
               leaves them in the power of their fool counsel. The example
               of  Saul  who  was  reproved  by  God  for  one  disobedience  is
               dreadful;  more  dreadful  is  the  example  of  our  first  parents
               who ruined humankind by sinning against obedience. For that
               reason  the  aspirant  who  is  indisposed  to  perfect  obedience
               must leave this community not to harm the others by his bad
               example (R.A.).


                             2. PRACTICE OF OBEDIENCE

                       Obedience  is  the  first  practical  rule  for  the  people
               who  want  to  reach  perfection  and eternal  life.  This  virtue  is
               precious  because  it  is  based  on  humility,  which  was  taught
               and  practiced  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  by  the  most  holy   263
               Virgin, and all the saints. Through this divine virtue, a person
               dispossesses himself, surrendering to God, who will dispose
               of him as he likes.
                       Obedience is the safest way to reach Christian per-
               fection, but it must be endowed with many qualities in order to
               be  perfect.  First  it  must  be  interior.  It  follows  that  the
               probationer  has  to  obey  for  God's  sake  imitating  our  Lord
               Jesus  Christ,  regardless  of  external  convenience  or  ulterior
               motive. Hence he has to see God in the superiors.

                       When  a  person  obeys  with  self-denial,  he  makes  a
               sacrifice  of  his  own  will,  deserving  more  merit.  We  must
               remember that our Lord Jesus Christ obeyed up to the]]></page><page Index="264"><![CDATA[death. Obedience is the death of selfishness, the sacrifice of
               one's own will, and is painful.

                       Obedience  must  be  blind.  Not  asking  nor  under-
               standing the why of the orders belongs to blind obedience.

                       Obedience must be ready; the more ready it is, the
               more is meritorious. At the command of obedience everything
               must be left such as a started work or a word that is being
               written or a Gloria Patri that is being said.

                    At last, obedience must be joyous because it is written: «
               God  loves  the  one  who  gives  gladly  »  (2  Cor.  9,  7).  The
               perfection of obedience consists in keeping in mind the rules,
               the superior's orders and will, doing everything according to
               them.

                       Humble, interior obedience requires of us to conform
               our  judgment  to  the  superiors'  judgment  when  we  carry  out
               their order, holding their command as good as it is right even
               when  it  appears  otherwise  to  us.  Besides  being  of  great   264
               importance, renouncing one's own opinion pleases the Lord
               and helps the soul so much.

                       To crown his perfection an obedient person precedes
               and carries out the superior's wishes. His spirit of obedience
               somehow makes him obey even his fellow and subordinates.

                       The  probationers  must  be  convinced  that  they  are
               unable  to  please  God,  to  improve  their  virtues,  and  to
               persevere  in  the  good,  unless  they  are  perfectly  obedient
               (P.R.P.). (8)

                       The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  love  holy
               obedience:  blind,  ready,  joyous,  simple,  constant,  interior,
               supernatural obedience; blind by obeying without seeking the
               why; ready, without making any delay; joyous, following  the
               orders  with  joy  and  sincerity,  even  when  aversion  is  felt;
               simple, making no distortion or excuse; constant, performing]]></page><page Index="265"><![CDATA[the obedience in due time and place, without having the order
               repeated; interior, by approving and holding the command as
               a  right  one  (except  sin);  and  supernatural,  by  obeying  for
               supernatural motive. Unlike the soldiers who obey far fear of
               punishment  and  unlike  the  employees  who obey  for  fear  of
               the fines or of losing their job, the Religious obeys for God's
               pure sake in order to please the adorable Heart of Jesus, to
               be united with him, to attract This blessings, and to become
               holy  and  rich  with  merits  and  virtues  when  the  celestial
               spouse  will  call  her  to  the  celestial  wedding.  Obeying  by
               supernatural  motives  requires  of  the  Religious  both  to  see
               God's and the most holy Virgin in the superiors as well as to
               see  God  and  the  most  holy  Virgin's  orders,  commands,
               counsels,  exhortations,  and  wishes  in  the  superiors'  orders
               (C.D.D.Z.).

                       Our Lord Jesus Christ walked the path of obedience
               to  death  -  his  death  on  the  cross  (Ph.  2,  8).  Each  of  his
               actions was a perfect obedience to his Father and often to his
               creatures will.
                                                                         265
                       How fortunate the obedient Religious is! She delights
               the  Heart  of  Jesus,  and  God  disposes  of  her  as  He  likes
               drawing  her  always  closer  to  Him.  The  saints  loved  obedi-
               ence so much as to sacrifice themselves, while God some-
               times worked miracles to help them obey. Let us be obedient,
               and we will belong totally to God!

                       St. Joseph Little Retreat novices will always consider
               that  they  cannot  find  Jesus  entirely  according  to  the
               novitiate's aim, unless they follow holy obedience, that every
               soul walking out of holy obedience is astray, and that every
               soul following holy obedience is on the way of divine union.

                       The  virtue  of  holy  obedience  is  as  manifold  as
               various:  it  must  be  practiced  with  the  superiors,  may  be
               practiced]]></page><page Index="266"><![CDATA[with  the  fellows,  and  even  with  the  subordinates.  Its
               perfection consists in preceding and carrying out the orders
               and the wishes of others. (9)

                       To be perfect in holy obedience, the novice will prac-
               tice  it  toward  God  and  the  Church  by  obeying  their  law;
               toward the superiors, by obeying their orders, precepts, and
               even counsels; toward the rules, by observing them exactly;
               toward  the  fellows  and  the  subordinates,  by  practicing
               obedience with prudence and discretion. By doing everything
               in  the  spirit  of  obedience  the  novice  will  sanctify  and  make
               meritorious her daily actions such as work, walk, eating, and
               recreation.  Eating  or  drinking  between  meals  or  borrowing
               things  will  be  done  with  the  superior's  permission.  Each
               novice will hold herself as a slave of holy obedience and will
               glory in it.

                       The  novice  will  keep  in  mind  the  divine  example  of
               Jesus who was obedient up to the death on the crass, and
               now  is  obedient  to  his  creatures  in  the  Holy  Sacrament  as
               well  as  the  example  of  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  who  is   266
               teacher  model  of  perfect  obedience,  and  the  saints,
               especially the glorious Patriarch St. Joseph (R.L.P.).


                                     C. CHASTITY

                       What  am  I  going to  say and  promise about  the  ob-
               servance  of  the  notable  virtue  and  vow  of  chastity?  I
               acknowledge that our Lord Jesus Christ brought this angelical
               virtue on earth to his elect and to the fortunate souls he calls
               out  of mercy  to  be  closer  to  him through  religious  life.  This
               special grace lifts up the soul to the angelical rank and to the
               mystical wedding with the immaculate lamb; the elect among
               the thousands God calls]]></page><page Index="267"><![CDATA[to  the  priesthood  or  to  the  religious  status  or  to  both
               understand it.

                       It  is  the  priest's  and  the  Religious'  sacred  duty  to
               observe  this  virtue  and  vow;  even  breaking  it  venially  by
               deliberate  consent  makes  them  grow  weak  in  the  other
               virtues, makes the intellect dim, the spirit weak, but the devil
               stronger  enough  to  tempt,  leading  the  people  to  total  ruin.
               Consequently, if I am not pure in soul, body, mind, and heart I
               will  not  be  humble,  obedient,  veracious,  and  observant  nor
               will I be a priest or a Religious.

                       A congregant who renounces chastity is unworthy of
               remaining in the order, he rather deserves being driven out;
               an  order  that  tolerates  such  a  rotted  member  or  an  order
               where God is offended by such a sin, even though secretly, is
               deteriorated before God. God would withdraw his blessings,
               demon would rule, good principles would become depraved,
               and all things would fall into ruin.

                       I  promise  to  always  contemplate  the  preeminence   267
               and the importance of chastity as well as to fervently implore
               every day the mast holy heart of Jesus, Immaculate Mary, the
               angels, the saints, and my guardian angel in order to prevent
               chastity  from  the  least  stain.  Always  bearing  in  mind  the
               psalmist's words: « God makes the angels His ministers, » as
               a priest I will consider that I have been made an angel of holy
               ministry because of chastity. As a Religious I will meditate on
               the words of the Song of Solomon, « He pastures his flock
               among the lilies, » that is to say, among the chaste souls as I
               must be with God's help and my good will.

                       In the presence of Jesus, our supreme goodness, the
               most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  the  angels,  the  saints,  and  my  own
               conscience  I  protest,  declare,  and  promise  to  cultivate
               internal  and  external  chastity  till  the end  of my  life.  Internal
               chastity, by keeping my mind and heart free from]]></page><page Index="268"><![CDATA[fantasies, suggestions, and temptations as well as by always
               more loving this angelical virtue. External chastity, by taking
               care of my eyes and senses as well as by avoiding to deal
               with  women  confidentially.  When  I  am  obliged  to  deal  with
               them or with young girls, I will be reserved and self controlled
               in my words, never looking at their face nor letting them kiss
               my hand.

                       The  pious  institute  of  Jesus'  Heart  is  made  of  the
               Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal's orders, who
               are separated and independent, but have relation of spiritual
               assistance.  I,  however,  promise  to  never  go  to  the  sister
               institute avoiding any connection with its congregants. If I am
               told by obedience to go, I will take the necessary caution of
               modesty and  words,  without  lengthening out  any relation  or
               talk with other persons. At the end of the visit or relation I will
               report everything to the superiors.


                              1. MOST PRECIOUS STONE
                                                                         268
                       Chastity!  This  is  the  virtue  that  leads  the  person  to
               the evangelical perfection making him worthy of being united
               with  God  according  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  saying:  «
               Happy are the pure in heart; they will see God! » (Mt. 5, 8).

                       This virtue is like a precious stone for this small com-
               munity's probationers, who must be chaste and pure in their
               thoughts, words, and actions (P.R.P.). (10)

                       Since  the  Rogationists  of  Jesus'  Heart  are going  to
               take  the  vow  of  this  angelical  virtue,  their  thoughts,  words,
               and actions must be purest. To keep holy chastity safe, they
               will be in the presence of God using the following means: 1)
               Prayer  and  daily  meditation  on  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's
               Passion; 2) mortification of the senses;]]></page><page Index="269"><![CDATA[3)  not  staring  at  women  neither  lingering  with  them;  4)
               avoidance  of  idleness  and  of  much  rest,  loving  work  and
               sacrifice;  5)  being  sincere  in  the  holy  confession  without
               neglecting  it;  6)  being  united  with  Jesus  in  the  daily  Holy
               Communion;  7)  avoiding  talk  with  lay  people,  reading  of
               newspapers, and the like; 8) never laying hands on people; 9)
               praying many times a day to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary,
               St.  Joseph, and  the  guardian  angel  in  order  to  observe  the
               angelical virtue :perfectly (C.R.).

                       To  keep  the  virtue  of  chastity  safe,  each  sister  will
               love internal and external mortification, humility of heart and
               humble  works,  modesty,  avoidance  of  curiosity,  silence,
               prayer, and attendance of the holy sacraments. The humble,
               contrite, and sincere confession is a most effective means to
               keep the people pure, but the daily Communion received with
               pure conscience, with feelings of love, due preparation, and
               thanksgiving transforms the people in God.

                       No one is allowed to lay hands on fellows and to form
               a particular friendship (F.R.).                           269

                       Chastity  is  the  most  precious,  shining  stone  of  the
               virgin consecrated to Jesus, who is the spouse of the souls,
               the eternal Word of God, eternally begotten of the Father in
               the  splendor  of  infinite  virginity  and  divine  holiness.  He
               pastures  among  the  lilies,  loving  the  chaste,  pure  soul.  To
               become  a  man,  he  wanted  an  immaculate  mother;  to  be
               buried, an undefiled sepulcher; to stay under the species of
               spotless bread he wanted pure ministers for the consecration
               of the Eucharist and pure, angelical brides for celestial love,
               so unknown to the world and its followers. To be a Daughter
               of Divine Zeal, one must be purest in order to light the divine
               zeal in an immaculate heart. No one but those who are dead
               to the senses and pure in their heart can feel the most]]></page><page Index="270"><![CDATA[holy Heart of Jesus' interests, be perfumed in the innermost
               of their soul, and say: « We are like a sweet-smelling incense
               offered  by  Christ  to  God  »  (II  Cor.  2,  1)!  The  Daughter  of
               Divine  Zeal  will  be  most  jealous  of  chastity!  She  will
               understand its divine excellence, will love and consecrate it to
               the sweetest Heart of Jesus, where she will contemplate and
               preserve it jealously like a pearl of Jesus' Heart. She will have
               a watchful care so that the lightest breath may not spoil this
               most  precious  virtue,  knowing  that  the  vow  makes  it  more
               brilliant and beautiful, but the least defect dims and defiles it
               (F.R.).

                       The  beautiful  virtue of  chastity makes  the  creatures
               like angels. The more a soul is chaste, the more it is spiritual;
               the more imperfect it is in this virtue, the more imperfect it is
               in the other ones. Jesus said: « Happy are the pure in heart;
               they  will  see  God!  »  The  Little  Retreat  novice  will  take
               watchful  care  of  her  soul  preserving  her  heart  jealously
               through  modesty,  retreat,  prayer,  mortification,  weekly
               confession,  and  daily  Communion,  which  makes  the  virgins
               flourish. Each novice will refrain both from curiosity and much   270
               talk keeping her eyes cast down and mortified, as much as
               she can. Keeping her heart free from creatures, she will avoid
               intimacy with everyone, loving all the people in God. Laying
               hands on people is not allowed to the novices (R.L.P.).


                    D. THE FOURTH VOW: ZEAL FOR THE ROGATE

                       The novices long to make the vow of praying to the
               most holy Heart of Jesus that he will send out good workers
               to  the  holy  Church.  For  such  a  purpose  they  will  combine
               prayer with works.

                       1. Prayer. They will pray:]]></page><page Index="271"><![CDATA[a. Three times a day, in common.

                       b.  Four  times  a  year,  during  the  Rogation  Days
               making the procession in the open. They will also pray to the
               apostles on their feast and to the Holy Sacrament during the
               exposition.

                       c. To win good workers, they will offer every day the
               holy mass, the rosary, Holy Communion, their pains, and the
               good works in union with the zeal of Jesus, who said: « Pray,
               therefore,» etc.

                       d. Each novice will pray in the secret of her heart all
               day  long  to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church,  adding
               offerings,  ejaculatory  prayers,  intentions,  mortifications,  and
               everything her zeal will suggest.

                    2. Works: the Little Poor of Jesus' Heart novices will be
               trained  in  different  works  regarding  their  community's
               well-proceeding  and  in  charity  toward  the  orphans  and  the
               spoor clerics. To please the most holy Heart of Jesus and to   271
               grow in holiness, they will apply themselves to various jabs
               with accuracy, practicing charity toward the orphans as much
               as obedience allows. To help the poor clerics, the novices will
               work and beg to obtain some income for them (R.L.P.). (11)

                       The fourth vow: zeal for winning good workers to the
               holy Church. Because this vow implies the best exercises to
               faster  divine  glory  and  salvation  of  souls,  it  embraces
               everything (C.P.).

                       A secret for the salvation of the Church and society is
               concealed in the practice of this divine command (C.R.).

                       The spirit of our institute is the zeal for the Heart of
               Jesus'  interests  that  are  abridged  in  the  words  «  pray,
               therefore », etc. Because all goods on earth proceed from the
               priesthood, by imploring good workers to the holy Church we
               aim at fostering the most holy Heart of]]></page><page Index="272"><![CDATA[Jesus' interests, who declared that the zeal for God's house
               was  consuming  him.  Now,  God's  house  is  the  universal
               Church  and  Jesus'  Heart  is  burning  with  desire  to  see  all
               souls entering this mystical ark of salvation. Oh! How much
               we  should  strive  to  become  holy  for  the  divine  mission  of
               fostering the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests (R.R.C.).

                       The  zeal  for  the  glory  of  God  and  for  the  good  of
               souls  must  be  predominant  in  the  Rogationists  of  Jesus'
               Heart,  because  they  have  the  mission  of  winning  good
               workers to the holy Church from his Heart.

                       Each  Rogationist  will  pick  up  from  Jesus  Christ's
               adorable mouth the divine command « pray, therefore, » etc.,
               which is the outcome of his divine zeal, and will consider its
               singular  importance  at  the  present  time  for  facing  the  evils
               which are afflicting the holy Church by lack of holy vocations.
               To  make  the  people  know  this  divine  command  and  this
               beneficial  devotion  each  Rogationist  will  do  his  best,  being
               himself one with Jesus in his burning thirst for the salvation of
               souls. Such a burning desire afflicted him from the time of his   272
               incarnation making him exclaim on the cross: « I am thirsty! »
               (C.R.).

                       The  obedience  to  this  divine  command  forms  the
               favorite joy, the chief point of the Daughters of Divine Zeal's
               vocation, mission, and glorious predestination (C.D.D.Z.).

                       Their  zeal for  this daily  prayer  will  be  always  active
               and increasing: they will understand its importance in the light
               of faith, will always keep in their mind our Lord Jesus Christ's
               command, will consider the immense good deriving from it as
               well as the merits which accumulate in time and eternity. In
               time they will share abundantly in the works of the priests; in
               eternity they will share in their glory, which is the highest one.
               They will be the]]></page><page Index="273"><![CDATA[wise  virgins,  whose  lamp  will  not  die  out  here,  but  will  be

               Through this zeal and prayer as well as through the spiritual
               fecundity of the perpetual virginity, the wise virgin bride of the
               virgins' king will somehow become mother of Jesus Christ's
               priesthood in the Church. Oh! If the Daughter of Divine Zeal
               answers and understands her vocation according to the spirit,
               she has a great vocation (F.R.)!



                                        NOTES


                   (1)  In 1918 things changed, because Canon Law defined exactly
               the simple vow's nature. The  importance of the vow of  poverty  is well
               known from our constitutions.
                   (2)  The   religious   holy   poverty   is   a  fundamental   vow   for
               the congregants, and they  must hold  it  as a greatest  treasure  and  as
               the  basis  of  the  order's  existence  and  progress.  The  more  the  order
               holds in esteem and  practices poverty, the more the order will  be firm,
               blessed, and improved by God (C.R.).                      273
                   «The Rogationists will possess no property in act, nor will they say
               mine,  referring  to  things  they  use,  they  will  say  instead  the  room,  the
               clothes I use, and the like having no thing in secret, not even a cotton
               thread.  They  will  be  fond  of  asking  for  the  humblest  suit,  the  worst
               shoes, and the poorest things in holy emulation » (C.R.).
                   (3)  The Daughter of Divine Zeal will love holy poverty very much
               holding  it as the great treasure  left by  Jesus  Christ our  Lord  to his
               true followers, to the beloved souls. The Daughter of Divine Zeal's heart
               will get married with holy  poverty, being fond of and glorying in it, for
               Jesus and the most holy Virgin loved it very much (F.R.).
                   (4)  No   mother   superior   will   act   the   gallant.   The   necessary
               objects will be of the lowest grade, excepted the  ones for the use of
               noble  guests.  Do not  say  that  some things  are  cheaper because they
               last  more;  even  those  of  low  grade  may  last  if  they  are  given careful
               attention.  It   is  also  of  no  avail   saying  that  some  elegant]]></page><page Index="274"><![CDATA[things are given free. We must avoid the devil's snare. Sometimes

                   (6)   « So that the aspirant's obedience may be meritorious before
               God it must be external and internal, that is to say, it must be done for

               attract    divine    blessings.    We      must    obey    in    spirit    of    faith,
               considering  God's  will   to   be  in  that  of  the   superior,   and   holding
               that      obedience      sanctifies      all      actions,      even      the      most

                   (7)   Blessed   be the  daughters   that  for Jesus'  sake   consecrate
               themselves to holy obedience. They will be the dearest ones to Jesus
               and Mary and will reach perfection quickly (D.S.S.).
                   (8)   «Obedience!  This  is  the  great virtue  that  the aspirant will
               practice to become dear to God and to the people, as well as to be worth
               advancing in the religious life. The aspirant's obedience must be ready,
               blind, joyous, and faithful.
                   Ready,  without  delay;  blind,  without  thinking  over  it,  because  the
               devil enters the reasoning about obedience and drives to transgression;
               joyous, means obedience with no aversion or agitation; faithful, means
               that the superior's order must be carried out punctually, and in the best   274
               way, as long as the order lasts. The aspirants will pay careful attention in
               order  that  their  obedience  be  always  faithful  and  endowed  with  the
               qualifications mentioned above, preventing it from becoming short-lived
               or useless; only by doing so they will get used to this beautiful virtues
               (R.A.).
                   (9)   «The Little Retreat  novice by the  Heart of Jesus will  strive to
               observe holy obedience in full, seeing to it:
                   a)  That  her  obedience  be  external  and   internal;  such   an
               obedience      requires      absolute      self-denial      of      her      judgement,

                                   MORTIFICATION

                   To  preserve  holy  chastity,  I  will  love  mortification,
               penance,  and  regular  discipline,  using  the  means  and
               caution  mentioned  above.  As  to  mortification  and
               penance,  besides  practicing  internal  humility  and
               continuous  contrition  for  my  past  faults,  I  will  not  feel
               offended  when  people  neglect  or  ignore  me,  silently
               considering  myself  worthy  of  worse  treatment.  When  I
               happen  to  expose  my  need,  I  will  do  so  with  calm  and
               simplicity.

                   Holy mortification of gluttony is of great importance,
               and  I  will fast  and abstain  perfectly  as  the  holy  Church
               commands:  if  health  reasons  or  anything  else  prevent
               me from doing so, I will submit my case to the superiors
               with  simplicity  and  will  follow  their  opinion.  I  will  also
               behave so about common food.
                                                                         275
                   As to the other mortifications and penances, such as
               those we do on the first Friday of the month or in special
               circumstances of the year or in the months of May and
               June, and in the novenas, as well as the nightly vigils of
               about an hour, the silence by rule, the service to the poor
               along  with  the  washing  of  their  feet,  the  whip,  and  the
               use of penance tools once or twice a week, I will follow
               the community's customs. Such penances, however, may
               be replaced for good reasons. Furthermore, I declare that
               I  am  ready  to  accept  any  penance when I  am  punished
               for my faults.

                   So  that  the  community  may  proceed  well,  everyone
               has  to  observe  the  schedule  of  the  acts  in  common.
               Beginning with the reveille In the morning, I promise to
               be punctual when the bell chimes the hour for the prayer,
               refectory,  spiritual  reading,  going  out,  recreation,  and
               sleep,  never  exempting  myself  of  my  own  will.  When  I
               have to be absent,]]></page><page Index="276"><![CDATA[I will do so with the superior's expressed or presumed per-
               mission.
                   I  recognize  the  Importance  of  regular  discipline.  My
               staying  and  behaving  in  community  will  be  unlike  my  be-
               having in the world or in the family or among the seculars;
               therefore,  I  will  pay  the  attention  and  the  caution  we  are
               obliged to use by the institute's rules, by the promises and
               declarations I have endorsed, by the mutual good example,
               and by the edification we have to give to the little, simple-
               minded people who live with us. To begin with, I will keep
               silence  according  to  the  rules  and  to  the  customs  of  the
               house, saying few, wise words when I have to talk. Second,
               usually I will speak Italian (I will only speak dialect when it is
               necessary  to  make  me  better-understood  by  the  poor  and
               children),  avoiding  gossip,  criticism,  anger,  and  reproach
               against the people who are not under my jurisdiction.
                   While staying among children, brothers, and outsiders I
               will  pay  careful  attention  to  restrain  myself  from  relating
               worldly,  useless,  shocking,  frivolous,  Idle  things,  or  news
               about crime, suicide, and the like which feed or excite cu-
               riosity.  Likewise,  I  will  refrain  from  complaining  about
               personal facts, food, service or events and troubles of the   276
               Institute  or  anything  else;  furthermore,  when  the  hearers
               might be surprised and shocked, I will not even complain in
               the presence of my brethren. Since I am entitled to relate to
               the superiors, when it is worth while I will do so with humil-
               ity, meekness, and simplicity.
                   I will be unaffectedly neat as much as it is consistent
               with  evangelical  poverty,  hating  the  intention  of  cutting  a
               good figure.


                                     1. SILENCE

                   The sisters are warmly recommended to avoid any chat,
               to be haters of idle talk, and to avoid useless words, keeping
               silence all day long except at play, where they will be modest
               and  self-possessed  to  set  good  example  to  the  children.  If
               they love silence, keeping it while]]></page><page Index="277"><![CDATA[working, they will produce, otherwise they lose time. Silence!
               Silence! Silence (S.I.G.)!

                    Holy silence is indispensable to keep order, to cultivate
               holy  virtues,  and  to  observe  the  rules.  Holy  Scripture  says
               that the spirit is strengthened by silence: « Your salvation lay
               in conversion and tranquility, your strength, in complete trust
               »  (Is.  30,  15).  On  the  contrary, «  A  flood  of  words  is  never
               without its fault » (Prov. 10, 19); and, « The man who talks
               too much will get himself disliked » (Eccl. 20, 8); as well as, «
               Happy the man who has never sinned with his tongue » (Eccl.
               25, 11). Holy silence was always kept by the communities of
               perfect observance.

                    The probationers will rigorously observe the rules about
               moderate and perfect silence. Perfect silence will be kept in
               religious  acts,  study,  refectory,  and  dormitory.  For  the
               remainder silence will be moderate, and the people will speak
               in  a  love  voice,  with  a  few  words  when  they  need  to  say
               something (P.R.P.).
                                                                         277
                    Silence  is  the  guardian  of  holy  prayer.  Since  it  is
               exceedingly  important  for  the  community's  well-proceeding,
               the novices will observe it exactly with God's help. Normally,
               they  will  not  speak  too  loud  nor  burst  out  laughing.  At  play
               there is no silence (R.L.P.).

                    Like  the  observant  communities,  the  sisters  will  pay
               careful attention to the rule of silence, keeping moderate and
               perfect  silence:  perfect,  from  reveille  to  after-mass,  in  the
               refectory,  and  in  the  dormitory  at  night;  moderate,  during
               work-time. During perfect silence, no word is to be said, and
               when the sisters need to speak they will do so in low voice.
               They  will  keep  moderate  silence  by  talking  in  a  low  voice,
               being  silent  the  most  they  can...  Let  us  remember  that  the
               Lord said that we have to give an account of even a useless
               word, that Jesus speaks to the]]></page><page Index="278"><![CDATA[souls in silence, and silence strengthens the spirit making the
               people avoid many faults (D.S.S.).

                    Discipline  requires  silence.  A  community  of  freely
               speaking, backbiting people is a fuss, a confusion, a disorder,
               where  neither  rule  nor  peace  nor  piety  nor  education  can
               reign.  On  the  contrary,  when  silence  stands  out  in  a
               community,  everything  proceeds  well;  there,  grumbling,
               useless  words,  and  defects  cannot  find  their  way.  The
               institutes' rules and the observant communities hold silence
               in great esteem, because it helps the people by concentrating
               their attention, by controlling their desires, and by mortifying
               their  heart;  furthermore,  it  keeps  their  soul  in  the  divine
               presence,  fosters  a  calm  and  gentle  spirit,  and  preserves
               virtues.  Those  who  accustom  themselves  to  silence  are
               worthy  to  hear  God  speaking  to  their  heart.  Holy  Scripture
               often praises silence, but condemns excessive talk. If silence
               is  indispensable  to  any  community,  at  greater  reason  it  is
               indispensable to a community of youths. The point of fact is
               that  to  grow  wise,  considerate,  pious,  and  recollected,  they
               need  to  bridle  their  tongue,  for  the  unbridled  people  grow   278
               thoughtless and inconsiderate (R.A.).

                    The rule of silence allows no grumbling, no fault finding,
               no  slander,  and  no  useless  words.  To  accustom  oneself  to
               the  beautiful  virtue  of  keeping  silence  it  is  of  importance  to
               also keep it interiorly (C.R.).

                    Keeping silence is a main rule of a religious community
               which allows the people to avoid many defects and to hear
               the Lord's sweet inspirations in their heart; for that reason I
               resolve  to  keep  moderate  and  perfect  silence  faithfully  and
               exactly.  Unsatisfied  by  external  silence,  I  will  also  keep
               internal  silence  by  bridling  my  mind  when  selfishness
               penetrates my internal thoughts to the prejudice of patience,
               meekness, humility, obedience]]></page><page Index="279"><![CDATA[and  charity.  I  will  also  restrain  my  curiosity  from  knowing,
               hearing,  and  interfering  with  matters  which  are  none  of  my
               business (P.D.).

                    Since most defects and disorders come from the tongue
               and « death and life are in the gift of the tongue » (Prov. 18,
               21);  I  will  pay  special  attention  to  bridle  my  tongue  in
               everything. I will not speak of myself proudly nor will I relate
               useless,  distracting  and  unbecoming  things,  nor  will  I
               backbite. I will not complain about anybody, especially about
               the  institute's  members,  nor  will  I  censure  nor  find  out  the
               defects of others, nor discuss my worldly life, nor will I fight to
               uphold  my  opinions.  Avoiding  harsh  words  even  to  my
               younger  mates,  I  will  speak  with  the  older  members  with
               humble, pious, and respectful words. Bearing in my mind the
               Holy  Spirit's  saying:  «  It  is  convenient  to  wait  in  silence  for
               God's  help  »  (D.  1907),  I  will  perfectly  observe  the  silence
               prescribed by the rule.


                            2. VARIOUS MORTIFICATIONS                    279

                    The  teacher  will  test  the  novices  in  many  ways  about
               humility, obedience, mortification, and sacrifice, and they will
               receive everything with spiritual pleasure in order to become
               acceptable to the celestial spouse, to destroy their bad habits,
               and to atone for their past sins. The novices must be told to
               practice  obedience,  mortification,  and  sacrifice  with  holy
               simplicity and sincerity.

                    As saber souls, they will not seek satisfaction in eating
               nor will they eat two different kinds of fruit, but will eat and
               drink as much as is sufficient, taking their time. As penitent
               souls,  they  will  love  mortification,  humiliation,  and  penance,
               which  are  so  much  hated  by  the  blind  world,  but  so  much
               loved by the saints. (1)]]></page><page Index="280"><![CDATA[The  Little  Retreat  novices  will  love  penance  with
               particular  affection  because  it  mortifies  the  passions,  but
               enlivens the spirit. No penance, especially cilice, whip, fast,
               and the like is allowed to the novices without the permission
               of holy obedience. They are told to practice the penances and
               the mortifications the fathers of spirit suggest, because such
               penances destroy the natural defects without harming health,
               sometimes helping it, instead.

                    The  mortifications  we  are  talking  about  are:  1)  ab-
               stinence from sweets, which are nothing else than a stimulus
               of  throat,  which  the  spiritual  persons  avoid;  2)  partial
               abstinence from fruit on certain days; 3) habitual abstinence
               from  eating  and  drinking  between  meals;  4)  feeding  on
               leftovers,  which  helps  humility,  but  destroys  gluttony;  this
               mortification,  however,  is  allowed  now  and  then  to  the
               novices who ask for it; 5) keeping perfect or moderate silence
               when  talk  is  allowed,  or  mortifying  the  eyes  or  renouncing
               play-time.  Such  penances  can  be  used  fruitfully  with  the
               superior's permission. Taking of a cup of coffee or milk or any
               drink  without  sugar  or  eating  a  dish  of  flood  or  fish  or  any   280
               soup  without  seasoning  falls  in  the  same  kind  of  penance.
               When  the  novice,  however,  may  appear  singular  for  doing
               much mortifications, she must avoid them (R.L.P.).

                    Neither the sisters are allowed to do bodily penances nor
               the  superiors  are  empowered  to  give  such  a  permission.
               Those in goad health will fast according to the holy Church's
               law.  Little  mortifications  that  pass  unknown  to  the  people,
               such  as  drinking  less  than  to  one's  fill,  delaying  a  drink,
               enduring  a  midge,  wearing  a  dress  of  poor quality,  and  the
               like,  are  helpful  to  the  spirit  and  are  allowed.  The  true
               penance consists in the practice of the interior virtues such as
               humbly confessing one's own]]></page><page Index="281"><![CDATA[faults,  restraining  and  overcoming  oneself,  keeping  oneself
               pure, enduring the troubles, suffering and loving the fellows
               and  the  pupils,  depending  on  the  superior's  will,  and
               sacrificing  oneself  for  Jesus,  our  supreme  good,  and  the
               souls (D.S.S.).

                    Even  when  the  confessor  permits  a  grave  penance,  it
               cannot  be  performed  without  the  superior's  permission.  But
               the little penances that pass unknown to the community are
               allowed;  they  are  effective  without  feeding  self-esteem
               (P.R.P.).

                    The congregants will fast according to the holy Church's
               law,  and  when  they  need  dispensation,  they  will  ask  the
               superior  for  it.  No  one  is  allowed  to  do  excessive  voluntary
               penances without the superior's permission, but each one will
               embrace  suffering,  mortifications,  contradictions,  sickness,
               nuisance,  and  anything  else  coming  from  the  reigning  or
               permitting will of God as beneficial and holy penances. They
               will  endure  them  with  great  love  and  holy  joy,  at  least  by
               intellect and will. It is also a beneficial penance any work that   281
               the people accomplish for the service of God and neighbor.
               Each  of  them  will  practice  the  little mortification  which  pass
               unknown  to  the  people,  such  as  expressing  no  complaint
               about food, mortifying gluttony in secret, restraining from talk,
               and the like which so many authors suggest. Everyone will be
               favorably  disposed  to  suffer  far  the  service of  God  and  the
               good  of  souls  the  inconveniences  of  holy  poverty,  any
               discomfort and sacrifice such as hunger, thirst, lack of sleep
               and  rest.  On  Immaculate  Mary's  and  Assumption’s  eve  the
               fast by eating bread only is allowed. On Holy Friday we are
               accustomed to kneel while eating the amount of food which is
               allowed  by  fast.  On  the  eve  of  various  feasts  and  in  other
               circumstances, we keep the vigil in the church for about an
               hour praying according]]></page><page Index="282"><![CDATA[ing to the superior's dispositions; no one can exempt himself
               without having the superior's permission (C.R.).

                              3. VOLUNTARY PENANCES

                   The Daughters of Divine Zeal will love, wish, and esteem
               the  voluntary  penances  which  foster  divine  love  and  holy
               virtues,  purify  the  souls  from  past  faults,  expiate  pain  on
               earth, and lighten purgatory's pain when they are performed
               with  pure  intention.  They  also  stimulate  the  souls  to  reach
               perfection,  accustoming  them to  suffering, mortification,  and
               destruction  of  selfishness.  Besides,  when  a  sister  exhorts
               herself  to  do  bodily  penance  with  the  only  aim  at  pleasing
               God  and  achieving  holy  perfection,  she  heartens  herself  to
               improve her virtues and to love the cross. Those who despise
               or under-value the bodily penances by saying that the interior
               ones are enough, do not show true spirit nor wisdom, nor the
               science of the saints; they only show that they are not striving
               to achieve interior virtues.

                   We must bear in mind our Lord Jesus Christ's saying: « I   282
               tell you that if you do not turn from your sins, you will all die
               as they did » (Lk. 13, 5) and the triple cry about penance that
               the most holy Virgin said through Bernadette’s mouth at the
               Lourdes  grotto,  «  Penance,  penance,  penance!  »  It  is  true
               that  our  Lord's  word  is  mainly  concerned  with  internal
               penance  and  with  repentance  for  sins  which  our  Lord
               elevated  to  a  sacrament:  the  humble,  sincere,  contrite
               confession  to  his  minister  in  the  priceless,  most  merciful
               tribunal  of  reconciliation.  Nevertheless,  God's  word  has  a
               wider sense; when he talked about penance, he also meant
               the voluntary one which the person who is called to perfection
               performs in order to reach her vocation goal; otherwise, she]]></page><page Index="283"><![CDATA[misses the religious perfection, jeopardizing her spirit through
               enfeeblement of repentance and resolve, and running the risk
               of  losing  the  spirit,  her  vocation,  and  eternal  salvation.  For
               that  reason  each  sister  will  esteem  bodily  penances,
               performing them in obedience to the rule and with discretion
               in order that they may be helpful.

                    The  mother  superior  will  moderate  and  control  the
               voluntary penances, keeping in mind:
                    a.  Sister's  health,  work,  and  job.  The  first  penance  a
               sister must offer to the Lord is the work she is doing in the
               community as perfectly as she can: for instance, getting up in
               the  night  from  necessity,  traveling  by  obedience,  washing,
               sweeping,  writing,  embroidering,  supervising,  being  hungry,
               thirsty,  tired,  and  enduring  incidents  when  things  and  the
               community require so.

                    b. The mother superior will also look at the improvement
               in the virtues of obedience, humility, zeal, and accuracy while
               the  sisters  perform  their  own  duty  or  when  they  renounce
               their own will and opinion, etc. Some souls happen to deceive   283
               themselves  through  bodily  penances;  they  are  able  to  do
               hardest  bodily  penances  without  hesitating  to  break  holy
               obedience,  humility,  charity,  fulfillment  of  their  duty,  etc.
               These  souls  consider  themselves  saints  for  their  bodily
               penances,  but  persist  in  the  bad  practice  of  the  virtues
               becoming  obstinate,  somehow  stubborn,  negligent,  angry,
               etc.  Depriving  them  of  their  voluntary  whimsical  penances
               and inflicting other penances, helps them. If they are willing to
               amend their vices in order to achieve holy virtues, they may
               be  allowed  to  perform  voluntary  penances  with  discretion;
               they,  however,  must  be  told  to  offer  their  penances  to  the
               Lord with the aim at amending their bad habit and improving
               religious virtues; otherwise, they will be forbidden to perform
               voluntary        penances          (S.D.D.Z.).       (2)]]></page><page Index="284"><![CDATA[4. NIGHTLY PRAYER

                    We  are  going  to  say  something  about  the  merit  and
               efficacy of nightly prayer. The saints held the nightly prayer in
               great esteem, practiced it all their life, and obtained copious
               graces  and  celestial  favors  for  themselves  and  the  whole
               Church. Even though our. Lord Jesus Christ had no need to
               pray, still he spent entire nights praying on the mountains, in
               the  caves  or  while  traveling;  hence,  the  saints  loved  the
               nightly  prayer,  and  the  sacred  writers  praised  and
               recommended  it.  Some  founders  laid  down  the  rule  which
               required arising in the night to say the divine office: this the
               Capuchins, the Theresians, and other sisters also practice. If
               our community of active life is unable to do that every night,
               still we should follow our custom of keeping some vigils in the
               night during the year as we did since the institute's origin.

                    These vigils are:

                    1. The night between the old and the new year. This vigil
               lasts  about  90  minutes.  We  enter  the  church  45  minutes   284
               before midnight and go out 45 minutes after midnight: In the
               first phase we thank God, the adorable our Lord Jesus Christ,
               the most holy Virgin, St. Joseph, St. Michael the archangel,
               St.  Anthony  of  Padua,  the  guardian  angels,  and  the  patron
               saints  for  the  spiritual  and  temporal  graces  they  granted
               during the year past. In the second phase, we start the new
               year by praising and blessing God. This holy practice in the
               pious institute of the Heart of Jesus' interests is called the first
               fruits, which are the beginning of the new year, the praise, the
               blessing, and other prayers of our prayer book.

                    2. One or two vigils in the holy week.]]></page><page Index="285"><![CDATA[3. On the night of Sept. 8 we keep the vigil for the most
               holy Mary's nativity, the celestial bambinella. By spirit we go
               around  St.  Anne's  house  praying  for  about  30-45  minutes
               before her birth at midnight. Then, we enter the house to see
               the Bambinella in the arms of her fortunate parents, St. Anne
               and  St.  Joachim.  Kneeling  and  reverent,  we  admire  the
               celestial  bambinella,  praise  her  glories,  and  renew  the
               celestial slavery of love imploring graces.

                    4. On Immaculate Conception's eve, we begin the vigil
               at  about  30-45  minutes  before  midnight  owing  to  the
               people's  belief  that  the  most  holy  Virgin's  immaculate  soul
               was  created  and  infused  in  her  immaculate  body  at  12:00
               midnight sharp.

                    At  12:00  midnight  sharp,  we  praise  the  immaculate
               bambinella  who  is  in  her  mother's  womb;  then  we  join  the
               adoration,  the  acts  of  charity  and  virtue  that  the  celestial
               bambinella  offered  to  the Most  High, her  Creator  and  Lord,
               from the beginning of her life. Keeping company together with   285
               her  thousand  guardian  angels  headed  by  St.  Gabriel  the
               archangel, we honor and offer ourselves to her through the
               sacred  slavery  of  love,  asking  for  graces  and  giving  our
               thanksgiving.

                    5. On the beautiful happy night of Christmas, our most
               adorable  sweet  baby  Jesus'  birthday,  we  keep  awake  to
               prepare ourselves through a thrill of loving expectation in the
               Bethlehem's grotto, where we are in spirit. We renew our filial
               slavery of love toward the baby through a specific prayer. On
               this  most  loving  night,  we  may  hear  one  or  two  or  three
               masses,  receiving  the  most  Holy  Communion  with  the  best
               dispositions  of  love  and  faith  in  order  that  the  baby  Jesus'
               mystical birthday may come true in each heart.]]></page><page Index="286"><![CDATA[6.  When  we  are  waiting  for  urgent  graces  for  fear  of
               divine  punishments,  when  human  persecutions  stirred  by
               demon  are  pressing,  it  is  always  right  to  have  recourse  to
               nightly prayer through special vigils.

                    7. If a sister feels drawn to pray in the night and is able
               to do so without being sleepy during the daily jab or prayer,
               she  can  ask  the  permission  from  the  mother  superior,  who
               may  grant  it  with  discretion.  Happy  and  acceptable  to  the
               Lord  is  the  sister  who  prays  in  the  night  before  the  Holy
               Sacrament  to  keep  Jesus  company,  to  talk  with  him  tête  à
               tête, to implore his divine mercies for her and the houses, for
               the sisters and the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests. Those
               who  feel  this  impulse  may  follow  it  with  the  superior's
               approval. Till the sister gets used to it, she may happen to be
               sleepy;  that,  however,  will  not  prevent  her  from  insisting,
               because as long as the sister has pure intention and makes
               efforts following holy obedience, the Lord will help her in the
               night prayer.

                    8. Ordering other vigils during the year depends on the   286
               mother  superior  general.  During  the  vigils,  the  houses'
               communities  will  be  united  in  spirit  in  order  to  form  one
               spiritual  community.  At  the  end  of  the  vigil,  the  souls  in
               Purgatory will be also remembered through some prayer. To
               keep the nightly peace, all the people will be perfectly silent
               before and after the vigil (S.D.D.Z.).



                                        NOTES

                   (1)  The  categories  of  penances  are  4:  determined,  imposed,
               voluntary, and disciplinary penances.
                   a)  Determined  penances  are  fast,  discipline,  and  sackloth  in  the
               days established by the rule as well as the 7 Glory to the]]></page><page Index="287"><![CDATA[Father  along  with  the  ejaculatory  prayer:  we  greet  you,  o
               immaculate blood etc., which we say with raised arms in the evening.
                   b)  Imposed   penances   are   the   ones   that   the   mother
               superior  imposes  to  the  novices'  community  or  to  the  individuals  for
               practice  of  mortification  or  for  test,  even  when  the  novices  are  not  at
               fault.
                   c)    Disciplinary    penances  are  the  ones  that  the  mother  superior
               imposes even wtien  the faults are light ones.
                   d)  Voluntary penances are the ones that the individuals do with the
               mother superior's  permission, following their fervor.
                   The  sick  people  and  those  of  delicate  constitution  may  humbly
               expose  their  situation  to  the  mother  superior,  following  her  decision.
               However, if they are granted special help and dispensation, they have to
               practice  humility  and  obedience  to  counterbalance  the  dispensation
               (R.N.).
                   (2) Saying specific prayer with the hands under the knees or with
               arms raised appears often in the primal rules; following upon, the prayer
               with raised hands remained for the 7 Glory to the Most Precious Blood,
               the  daily  Our  Father  to  St  Antony,  and  the  5  Our  Fathers  on  the  first
               Friday  of  month;  about  the  hands  under  the  knees,  we  read  the  last
               writing by the padre: « Doing penance by putting the hands under the
               knees is not allowed» (S.D.D.Z.).

                              RECEIVING CORRECTIONS

                   If  ever  the  superiors  warn  or  admonish  me  for  my
               faults, I will receive their warnings and admonitions with
               humility of heart and with all my soul, without justifying
               myself  or  arguing  about  It;  on  the  contrary,  I  will
               acknowledge my fault with humble, simple heart and will
               amend. If I am not aware of the fault, I will consider my
               being  unable  to  see  it  as  due  to  my  selfishness  which
               has dimmed my sight, and, therefore, I need to humiliate
               myself twice in my heart. If I am sure I have not fallen into
               the fault I am charged with, for humility and prudence's
               sake I will keep silence or I will justify myself calmly and
               with simplicity once or twice.




                   1. PRACTICE OF HUMILITY AND MORTIFICATION             289

                    When  the  superior  warns,  or  admonishes,  or  inflicts  a
               penance  to  someone,  the  subject  will  receive  and  execute
               everything  with  humble  heart,  without  internal  and  external
               remonstrances, even if he feels undeserving of it, attributing
               such a feeling to selfishness (C.R.).

                    The  mother  superior  may  inflict  little  penances  or
               disciplinary  mortifications  for  external  faults,  and  the  culprit
               has to receive and execute them with humility, adding internal
               acts  of  virtue.  Such  penances  may  be  kneeling  in  the
               refectory  or  kissing  the  earth  or  saying  some  prayers  with
               raised  hands  or  begging  pardon  while  kneeling  in  the
               refectory, and the like (D.S.S.). (1)]]></page><page Index="290"><![CDATA[To amend and to atone on earth for the faults they would
               expiate  in  purgatory  amidst  burning  fire,  the  novices  will
               practice penances for their daily faults. The mother superior
               will diversify the penances according to quality and number of
               defects,  and  the  novices  will  execute  them.  The  mother
               superior  will  also  see  that  penances  be  fitting  for  the  faults
               and suitable for expiation and emendation (R.L.P.).

                    The  aspirant  will  humbly  receive  the  penances  or
               punishments which the superiors inflict for his faults against
               the  rules,  considering  himself  deserving  of  them;  he  will
               execute them exactly without protesting, and at the end of the
               penance  will  go  to  the  superior  to  thank  him  and  to  beg
               pardon.

                    The youths who long for sanctification and admittance to
               the religious community must be ready to receive penances
               and punishments even for small faults, always being glad to
               amend more and more (R.A.). (2)

                    Following the exhortation of the apostle we have to strive   290
               in  order  to  become  humble  and  to  abate  ourselves  without
               undervaluing  anyone.  But,  if  we  happen  to  sadden  our
               fellows,  we  have  to  beg  pardon,  humbling  ourselves.  We
               must  accept  reproofs,  reprimands,  and  penances  with
               humility,  avoiding  justifying  ourselves,  since  the  upright
               person  begins  his  talk  by  charging  himself.  Let  us  endure
               want,  affliction,  contradictions,  lack  of  food,  clothes,  and
               everything,  considering  how  much  Christ,  his  most  holy
               mother, and the patron saints suffered for us (R.R.C.).

                    If  the  probationers  happen  to  fall  in  same  defect,  they
               will  receive  willingly  the  penances  that  the  superiors  inflict.
               Such  penances  will  be  proportionate  to  the  faults,  and  the
               probationers will accept them with humility and mortification,
               thinking of deserving them. Who receives corrections shows
               that 'he is a simple-minded person]]></page><page Index="291"><![CDATA[well  disposed  to  virtue;  on  the  contrary,  who  refuses
               corrections shows that he is a proud, incorrigible person.

                    We  warmly  exhort  the  probationers  to  humble  them-
               selves interiorly when they are corrected, and to accept the
               punishment  as  deserving  of  it;  otherwise  selfishness  will
               deceive  them.  The  probationer  who  longs  for  religious  life
               recognizes his failure every time he is corrected; if he did not,
               he would be unable to improve virtue, and his vocation would
               appear fallacious. Let us remember the words of the psalmist:
               « A virtuous man may strike me in reproof for my own good,
               but a wicked one shall never anoint my head with oil » (Ps.
               141, 5) (P.R.P.).


                             2. HARD TASK: CORRECTION

                    Correcting his subjects' defects is a hardest task for the
               superior. The more this task is of importance, the harder it is
               when the superior undertakes it without appropriate caution,
               because he may fail and harm, instead of correcting.      291

                    Nothing is so delicate as correcting. Correcting is like a
               drug; when its dose is wrong or the drug itself is mistaken it
               may  be  poison  or  at  least  dangerous.  For  instance,  if  you
               reproach  when  a  reserved  judgment  should  be  enough,  or
               you  scold  when  a  sweet  word  is  needed,  it  is  like
               administering  a  wrong  drug,  which  is  harmful  instead  of
               healing.  Oh,  how  much  ruin  the  wrong  corrections  bring
               about! To perform his duty well, therefore, the superior must
               diagnose the defects.

                    First,  he  has  to  understand,  know,  value,  and  be  fully
               aware  of his  subjects'  defects  by  resorting  to  prayer,  divine
               enlightenment,  and  careful  attention.  He  has  to  spiritually
               diagnose each subject in order to understand the roots of the
               defects, for they are different from person to person; some of
               the roots are deeper, others shallow;]]></page><page Index="292"><![CDATA[here,  there  is  more  malice,  there,  more  weakness  and  fra-
               gility.  The  understanding  of  various  individuals'  defects  is
               indispensable for the application of remedies.

                    To understand the individuals with their defects, nature,
               and character, so as to apply the right remedy, each superior
               will pray insistently to God to obtain enlightenment. The daily
               prayer  must  be  said  in  each  particular  case  through  an
               intimate invocation upon the Lord, when correction is needed.
               Our  daily  prayer  to  the  Lord  and  the  most  holy  Virgin  for
               helping us in dealing with subjects reaches its aim when we
               pray for particular cases, especially when we are responsible
               for the people and ask for enlightenment. In such cases our
               Lord  cannot  help  but  grant  it  success.  But,  if  the  superiors
               neglect the remote  and the immediate prayer, they will lack
               enlightenment and become unworthy of it. The superior must
               pray continuously to win enlightenment on how to guide the
               community and the individuals. In particular cases, when the
               matter  is  urgent,  he  will  pray  interiorly,  even  for  a  moment
               before acting.
                                                                         292
                    He  will  also  pray  to  win  enlightenment  about  how  to
               correct  the  faulty  subject.  Sometimes,  correction  may  be
               made  immediately  through  admonition;  warning,  or  repri-
               mand;  sometimes,  it  may  not;  besides  time  and  prayer,
               counsel  may  be  also  needed.  The  superior  needs  first  to
               reflect  on  the  nature  of  the  fault, degree  of culpability,  etc.;
               second, he has to find out the right remedy; third, the subject
               too  needs  time  to  be  more  prone  to  accept  correction.  To
               make the correction beneficial, the superior will let the subject
               know his fault, will pray, and will tell other people to pray for it,
               if necessary.

                    Even  though  the  superior  may  dissimulate  some  small
               defects along with some concealed reactions of his subjects,
               he    must   correct   the   defects   at   their   rising.]]></page><page Index="293"><![CDATA[3. ZEAL, NOT ANGER

                    The superior will beware of correcting under the impulse
               of anger or indignation, avoiding to offend the subject or his
               parents by talking, for instance, about his  poverty, low birth,
               etc., because it hurts. When the superior becomes angry, he
               needs  to  restrain  himself,  cooling  dawn  and  delaying  the
               correction. Ecclesiasticus says that in anger people say many
               words  that  later  they  find  unjust.  Sometimes,  however,  the
               superior  may  correct  in  a  somewhat  loud  voice  if  zeal
               requires it. But true zeal requires that the superior be devoutly
               indignant,  self-controlled,  worried  for  God's  glory  and
               salvation  of  souls  as  well  as  concerned  with  eliminating  or
               remedying bad examples. The prophet said that one may be
               angry  without  sinning.  The  superior  will  speak  firmly,  will
               seriously consider the offense, and will show that his attitude
               is  from  zeal,  not  from  anger  or  scorn.  Anger  and  scorn  are
               devastating  to  the  soul  of  the  subject,  and  thrust  him  into
               diffidence  and  desperation.  Zeal,  instead,  is  pure  charity,
               enlivens,  and  attracts,  even  though  it  sometimes  seems  to
               throw  down.  Such  a  correction  must  go  along  with  the   293
               superior's dignity, because it can be lost by anger or even by
               a  gesture or  word of  scorn.  Correcting  on  time,  in  the  right
               place,  with  discretion,  strength,  and  dignity  is  most  difficult;
               therefore,  the  superior  will  bear  in  mind  these  precautions
               and will pray in order that he may be fair, calm, and decorous.


                               4. FITTING CORRECTION

                    It  is  the  superior's  duty  to  admonish  his  subjects  by
               means of the following corrections:

                    First, the corrections must be fitting to the persons,]]></page><page Index="294"><![CDATA[their  sensibility,  intelligence;  character,  and susceptibility  as
               well as to the defects or gravity of the faults.

                    The  superior  must  be  aware  that  correcting  the  wrong
               doer  in  the  presence  of  other  people  is  sometimes
               inconvenient,  because  it  renews  bad  example  or  calls  the
               people's attention to facts they should forget, or scandalizes
               persons  who  know  nothing  of  the  matter.  For  instance,  if
               someone referred that a subject talked back to the superior or
               grumbled  secretly,  the  superior  will  beware  of  reproaching
               such a subject in the presence of other persons, because it
               could scandalize or induce others to do the same.

                    If  the  fault  is  committed  in  the  presence  of  the  com-
               munity,  the  superior  will  ask  the  culprit  to  remedy  the  fault
               before all in the refectory or elsewhere by begging pardon or
               by  pleading  guilty.  He  will  always  avoid  to  call  attention  to
               faults  whose  remembrance  could  harm.  It  is  to  no  avail
               saying:  such  are  defects  everybody  knows,  because
               reminding  them  of  the  defects,  causes  them  to  be  firmly
               impressed on their memory.                                294

                    The superior will never attribute anything to the subject
               by  rash  judgment,  for  instance,  by  attributing  intentions  the
               subject  never  had  or  actions  he  never  did.  This  is  a  most
               delicate  matter.  But  suppose  that  the  superior  is  a  spiritual
               man who knows the culprit's malice along with his faults, yet
               the culprit is reluctant to acknowledge it more by ignorance
               than by stubbornness. In such a case the superior will tell him
               to  pray  and  reflect,  or  will  make  him  declare  that  he  will
               humble  himself  twice:  first,  because  he  is  at  fault,  second,
               because  he  is  unable  to  acknowledge  it.  If  the  subject
               acknowledges neither of them by stubbornness, the superior
               will  warn  him  more  seriously,  sending  him  back  to  pray,
               reflect, and meditate.]]></page><page Index="295"><![CDATA[He himself will do the same, also asking other people to pray
               for the culprit.

                    When the superior admonishes a culprit, he must aim at
               inducing the subject to recognize his fault and other defects
               that  accompany  it.  If  the  culprit  does  not  acknowledge  any
               fault, he is hopeless, is very likely to go from bad to worse,
               and, therefore, he must be expelled.

                    Suppose that the subject is good-natured and observant,
               but  for  particular  reasons  he  acknowledges neither  his  fault
               nor  its  gravity,  keeping  silent  by  caution.  If  the  fault  is  not
               serious and obvious, the superior will interpret his silence as
               acknowledgment, because he is not opposing obstinately the
               fact.

                    Were  the  superior  to  impose  correction  without  the
               Lord's enlightenment for lack of prayer, or were the superior
               to judge a subject for personal passions, faults, malice, and
               bad intentions when such things do not exist, or at least not
               as he sees them; in such a case, the superior's demand of   295
               the subject to acknowledge the faults as he has judged them
               (God  forbid  it)  would  prejudice  the  subject's  soul  seriously.
               Serious  too  will  be  the  consequences  such  as  diffidence,
               anxiety,  discouragement,  and  even  true  faults  and  loss  of
               vocation.

                    To avoid ruin to the souls, each superior will pay careful
               attention  to  building  up  a  spirit  of  religious  perfection  in
               himself, keeping in mind the Holy Spirit's words: « Stick to the
               advice your own heart gives you, no one can be truer to you
               than that » (Eccl. 37, 17).


                                  5. TAKING COVER

                    As  soon  as  the  superior  perceives  that  he  has
               miscalculated the correction, he will pray to the Madonna of
               the  Remedy,  himself  starting  remedying  by  retracting  the
               correction directly or indirectly. In case of need, he]]></page><page Index="296"><![CDATA[will not hesitate to redress the wrong by declaring plainly his
               mistake, because upholding the mistake is arrogance and the
               cause  of  serious  consequences.  We  must  implore  for  the
               divine enlightenment in everything.

                    If  a  superior  should  be  offended  by  a  subject,  he  will
               avoid considering it a personal case, or reacting with a burst
               of passion and selfishness. On the contrary, he will have pity,
               keeping  a  calm  and  decorous  silence  to  make  the  culprit
               retire into himself. Until the culprit does not see his error, the
               superior will pay some tender care to him, returning good for
               evil and showing love and charity, 'but in such a way that the
               culprit may not think of being in the right. This method is mast
               suited  to  subdue  and  make  the  culprit  repent.  However,
               everything must be within bounds; if it does not matter to the
               culprit, but he abuses, the superior will resort to persuasion,
               reserve, and penances, if necessary.

                    When the superior is unsure as to how to correct serious
               faults, or if he is uncertain about the method of correction, he
               will  pray,  will  take  advice  from  his  counselors,  and  will  go   296
               ahead  with  them;  it  is  understood  that  all  of  them  have  to
               pray.

                    If  corrections  in  the religious  institutes  were made  with
               holy caution after imploring God's help, many evils would be
               avoided,  several  persons  would  amend,  observance  and
               discipline  would flourish,  and  the  superior  would  proceed  in
               full  agreement  with  the  subjects,  because  corrections  are
               drugs  whose  efficacy  depends  on  the  right  application  of
               them in weight, number, and measure (R.S.)!


                                  6. A PAINFUL SIGN

                    The  mother  superior  must  keep  in  mind  that  when
               events compel her to use bodily or moral punishments]]></page><page Index="297"><![CDATA[toward  several  persons,  relaxation  has  already  entered  the
               community to ruin it. Other means are needed to bar such a
               thing. The mother superior must pay careful attention to ward
               off  such  .great  an  evil  by  correcting  little  defects  with
               gentleness  and  firmness,  even  through  moral  or  bodily
               ,punishments, inducing people to accept such penances with
               humility,  mortification,  and  for  God's  sake.  She  will  enliven
               the  spirit  of  prayer,  observance,  and  practice  of  religious
               virtues.  So  to  speak,  she  must  thrust  relaxation  out  of  the
               doors,  locking  it  out.  She  will  pray  and  watch  over  her
               mystical  flock  so  that  the  hellish  lion  roaring  around  the
               sheepfold be unable to enter and devour even one soul. She
               first  must  show  a  holy,  irreproachable  behavior,  setting  the
               example of religious virtues and sacrifice for our Lord, for the
               good of the community, and for each person.

                    No  continuous  hard  reproach,  no  serious,  frequent
               punishment, but these are the means apt to correct and lead
               the subjects to perfect observance, making the house to be a
               garden flourishing with elect souls, where the divine eternal
               lover Jesus finds his delight (S.D.D.Z.).                 297

                            MUTUAL LOVE AND RESPECT

                   To  my  great  pleasure  I  declare  that  I  have  learned
               that this institute holds In great esteem mutual love and
               respect,  and  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  command:  «
               love each other as I loved you », which distinguishes the
               true Christians, in this institute is a main precept like the
               command:  «You  must  love  the  Lord  your  God  with  all
               your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. »

                   With  God's  help  and  my  own  good  will  I  pledge
               myself,  promising  to  pay  careful  attention  to  this  holy
               love. I will try to form a tender, affectionate, loving heart
               for  the  members  of  the  institute,  asking  the  most  holy
               Heart of Jesus to grant me the spirit of charity toward my
               brethren in order to love, sympathize, wish, and procure
               their good as much as I can, as if it were mine.

                   Bewaring  of  nurturing  aversion  or  grudge  against   299
               anyone,  still  less  against  those  who  seem  contrary  or
               offensive to me, I promise the following:

                   1.  I  will  not  be  prone  to  believe  that  I  have  been
               offended,  I  will  think  instead  that  my  imagination  and
               selfishness amplify the things making them appear grim
               to me.

                   2.  If  someone  really  offends  me,  I  will  not  become
               indignant,  but  I  will  sympathize,  love,  and  look  on  him
               favorably,  recommending  him  to  the  Lord  in  order  to
               return good for evil.

                   I  will  combine  holy  love  with  my  sincere  respect
               toward  the  institute's  components,  adults  or  children,
               superiors  or  fellows  or  servants,  considering  that  God
               created,  redeemed,  and  gathered  them  here;  that  our
               Lord  gave  up  himself  for  each  of  them,  that  he  feeds
               them with his divine body and Most Precious Blood more
               than often, destining them to]]></page><page Index="300"><![CDATA[eternal glory. Avoiding to even saying the least offensive
               word to a child, I will address the priests with the title of

               and the children.



                           1. THE VIRTUES' TOUCH-STONE

                    The  world  ratifies  revenge  as  a  predominant  passion
               with  this  anti-evangelical  saying:  only  the  mountains  do  not
               meet! People are vindictive by nature; they hardly forget an
               offence,  but  pay  with  the  same  coin at  the  first  opportunity.
               The  offended  person  may  be  a  good  person,  even
               consecrated  to  the  Lard,  who  abhors  revenge  by  principle.
               Still,  if  he  was  offended  or  thinks  he  has  been  seriously
               offended, he takes no revenge in the open, but if he has the
               power to favor his true or presumed offender, he won't do so!
               And because he needs to harmonize his conscience and the
               divine  law  of  forgiveness  with  his  revenge,  he  will  create
               palliatives by rationalizing and deceiving himself through his   300
               reasoning.  Oh,  in  how  many  cases  the  real  gist  is  to  vent
               one's offended and resented selfishness! Because of that the
               Lord will judge so many actions that we call justice and truth!
               « I will dispense strict justice » (Ps. 75, 2). (Oration, Mons.
               Carrano).

                    Behaving  charitably  and  conveniently  with  the  persons
               who live with us is the touch-stone of virtue and good nature.
               Behaving  cements  the  community,  which  subsists  in  the
               members' mutual union of charity. The best rule far this topic
               is our Lord Jesus Christ's saying, « As I have loved you, so
               you must love one another » (Jn. 13, 34) as well as « If you
               have love for one another, then all will know that you are my
               disciples » (Jn. 13,35).]]></page><page Index="301"><![CDATA[The probationers will avoid quarreling and loud talk with

               nor accuse one of anything out of personal vengeance not:

               sympathize and help each other even though it may require
               some sacrifice. The observance of this rule is indispensable
               to form this community with the Lord's help.

                    That the probationers must be united in mutual love of
               charity  goes  without  saying,  but  they  must  beware  of
               nurturing  particular  friendship,  because  it  draws  the  soul
               away from love of Jesus and from vocation to religious life;
               therefore, the probationers are not allowed to confide secrets
               to each other nor to talk and stay alone by two (P.R.P.).

                    Each  aspirant  will  restrain  himself  from  nurturing  a
               grudge  against  his  fellows,  from  scorning  or  charging  them
               with  anything  for  personal  trifles,  instead  he  will  endure
               contradictions  with  patience,  will  sympathize,  respect,  and
               love his fellows in the Lord, being always ready to favor, help,   301
               and serve them.

                    For  discipline  and  virtue's  sake  the  aspirants  will  avoid
               flying  into  passion,  giving  free  rein  to  angry  words  and
               actions;  they  must  accustom  themselves  to  restrain  their
               natural impulses out of mutual respect.

                    Laying hands on and forming particular friendship harm
               spirit and discipline; therefore they are strictly forbidden to the
               aspirants, but they must love and esteem each other equally.
               It  is  also  unbecoming  for  them  to  give  the  eye  or  laugh  or
               make signs, as agreed upon (R.A.).]]></page><page Index="302"><![CDATA[2. ONE HEART, ONE SOUL

                    I promise to respect my fellows, behaving with kindness,
               sincere and pure affection, as well as to be free from personal
               attachment, liking, and intimacy, warding off the people who
               try to have such relations; if they persist, I will refer everything
               to the mother superior. I will also avoid nurturing aversion or
               grudge  against  anyone,  still  less  against  those  who  seem
               contrary or offensive to me (D.P.). (1)

                    The  sisters  will  respect  and  love  each  other  in  Jesus
               Christ  with  pure,  simple,  hearty,  and  gentle  affection
               sympathizing  mutually,  keeping  peace  and  harmony,  and
               warding off  any  resentment as  a  devil's  temptation.  No  one
               will speak ill of another, no one will marvel at their defects,
               but they will pray and help each other within the bounds of
               holy obedience. If someone happens to offend a fellow, she
               will humbly ask her for pardon, and the other one will do the
               same (D.S.S.).

                    Since  the  community  is  unable  to  please  God,  to   302
               improve,  and  to  produce  fruits,  unless  it  is  enlivened  by
               charity  through  union  of  hearts,  the  sisters  will  strive  to  be
               united in the charity of Jesus Christ, and to become one heart
               and one soul. So that their spiritual union may be founded on
               Jesus  Christ's  pure  charity,  the  novices  will  avoid  the  least
               intimacy or particular familiarity, avoiding to touch or hug or
               kiss each other. They will restrain themselves from useless or
               unbecoming  talks,  from  confiding  secrets  and  things
               concerning  confession,  from  speaking  ill,  from  letting  off
               steam, from sharing in nevus which feeds curiosity, and from
               any  other  confidential  relationship;  they  instead  will  practice
               charity by bearing with one another, by wording off even the
               least]]></page><page Index="303"><![CDATA[grudge from their heart, by praying and helping each other in
               their  work  and  much  more  in  sickness.  Each  of  them  will
               choose the worst things and the last place for herself, leaving
               the  best  to  the  others.  If  someone  happens  to  displease  a
               fellow,  she  will  humbly  beg  pardon  following  the  advice  of
               obedience.  They  will  deal  with  mutual  respect,  calling  each
               other  sister...  Admonishing  each  other  is  also  a  practice  of
               charity. Therefore, if a novice happens to notice a defect, she
               may kindly let her sister knave it in order to amend. The sister
               who  has  been  cautioned  will  receive  the  advice  humbly,
               amending and thus advancing in holy perfection (R.L.P.).

                    Loving  this  institute's  members  as  myself  is  my  main
               goal for reaching evangelical perfection. So, I will respect all
               of them, holding each one greater than I am before God; I will
               bear any defect or piece of rudeness with love, patience, and
               kindness being ready to help and serve my fellows as much
               as charity and obedience allow me. In everything, my rule will
               be our Lord Jesus Christ's command, « As I have loved you,
               so you must love one another » (Jn. 13, 34). I will be never
               envious of them, either when they are preferred or are told to   303
               be  right  and  I  am  told  to  be  wrong,  or  when  they  are
               appointed to offices which I am being denied; keeping myself
               calm and unchanged, I will always have with them relations of
               peace, charity, and humility (P.D.P.).

                    This  pious  institute's  congregants  will  bear  in  mind  the
               adorable  Heart of  Jesus'  commandment, « As  I  have  loved
               you, so you must love one another. If you have love for one
               another, then all will know that you are my disciples » (Jn. 13,
               34-35).  Each  one  will  jealously  preserve  union  of  hearts
               through  mutual  charity,  holding  the  others  as  beloved
               brothers in Jesus Christ as well]]></page><page Index="304"><![CDATA[as bearing with each other without forming a bad opinion of
               any  of  them.  Mutual  help  will  be  within  the  bounds  of  holy
               obedience, and no one will offend his brother in Jesus Christ.
               Not  even  fleeting  aversion  or  grudge  is  allowed,  and  when
               something might impair mutual love, each congregant should
               precede  his  brothers  in  the  reconciliation.  Mutual  charity
               suffers  no  affection  of  personal  liking  or  attachments;
               therefore each one will respect the others, regarding them as
               our Lord Jesus Christ did (C.R.).


                                3. MORTUARY CHAPEL

                    Each  house  should  build  a  mortuary  chapel  in  the
               cemetery  as  a  communal  burial  place  for  those  who  were
               united in life by Christ's bonds of charity. They were sisters in
               the divine savior’s adorable blood, lived in pure love for each
               other,  sharing  in  the  same  joy,  the  same  pain,  the  same
               work,' and were destined to be united in heaven. It is right,
               beautiful, and desirable that they rest in the same mortuary
               chapel. The houses which do not have it yet, will do their best   304
               through prayer and human means to build it. Meantime they
               will  provide  each  dead  with  a  cell  or  a piece  of  land  in  the
               cemetery, registering the file or the cell or the place's number
               where  their  human  remains  rest  so  that  they  may  be
               transferred to the future mortuary chapel (S.D.D.Z.).


                                        NOTE

                   (1)  I  promise  the  following:  1)  I  will  not  easily  think  of  being
               offended, because my fantasy and selfishness amplify the little things,
               making them appear grim to me. 2) If someone offends me really, I will
               not be angry, but compassionate; furthermore I will love, look favorably,
               and recommend her to the Lord in order to return good for evil with the
               Lord's  help.  Likewise  I  will  beware  of  charging  or  ill-treating  or  taking
               pleasure in her suffering in any way, out of vengeance » (D.P.).]]></page><page Index="305"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XI

                            RELATIONSHIP WITH PEOPLE

                    For  our  duty  of  setting  good  example,  for  the
               institute's  honor,  for  my  spiritual  improvement,  and the
               improvement of others I will pay careful attention when I
               deal with people in the institute and outside of it, treating
               everyone with prudence, respect, and charity. I will avoid
               setting  bad  example,  becoming  agitated,  and  offending
               anyone,  because  I  want  to  practice  the  Apostle  Paul's
               statement: « We do not want anyone to find fault with our
               work, so we try not to put obstacles in anyone's way » (2.
               Cor.  6,  3).  So,  I  will  cope  patiently  and  benignly  with
               everyone, especially with the troublesome, the poor, and
               the sick, dissimulating any insult and bearing in mind the
               Ecclesiasticus'  saying:  «  The  wise  man  dissimulates
               insults, but the fool gets angry quickly. »


                                                                         305

                                 1.  GOOD EXAMPLE

                    The  congregants  will  combine  fine  manners  with
               simplicity  and  religious  decorum  while  dealing  with  them-
               selves  and  with  outsiders,  striving  to  be  cheerful,  and
               avoiding sadness or ill humor.

                    A  gracious,  sympathetic,  and  friendly  manner  to  every-
               one is a great religious virtue, and greatly recommended to
               this pious institute's members. To accomplish the aim of the
               institute,  the  congregants  will  nurture  and  practice  spiritual
               and temporal charity toward their neighbor through works of
               religion  and  beneficence,  as  much  as  they  can,  and  will
               console everyone with holy words and]]></page><page Index="306"><![CDATA[temporal help, avoiding to afflict anyone. While dealing with
               their  offenders  and  opposers,  they  will  conduct  themselves
               with  particular  charity,  returning  greater  good  to  them  and
               avoiding revenge (C.R.).

                    To be acceptable to the most holy Heart of Jesus, with
               his  divine  help  I  resolve  to  observe  not  only  the  religious
               rules,  but  also  gracious  manners  while  treating,  talking,
               walking, eating, laughing, visiting, etc. (D.P.).

                    So that the religious virtues may edify and win souls to
               the  Lord,  the  sisters  will  behave  devoutly,  setting  perfect
               examples of a holy, virtuous life and being observant in their
               mutual relationship and with the outsiders, in private and in
               public (H.S.E.).


                                    2. SIMPLICITY

                    God is simplest spirit, draws the simple to  himself, and
               talks with them. The principle of religious virtue requires that   306
               one  practices  simplicity  of  heart  and  avoids  simulation,
               duplicity, and hypocrisy toward God and neighbor. Avoidance
               of rash judging anyone and the disposition to justify or regard
               the  failings  of  others  with  indulgence  also  belong  to  holy
               simplicity. This virtue does not lead one to disapprove of the
               orders of obedience or to condemn the actions of others, but
               disposes them to look on everything as good through a child's
               belief.

                    Simplicity is also characterized by prudence to which our
               Lord  Jesus  Christ's  pointed:  «  You  must  be  as  cautious  as
               serpents and as gentle as doves » (Mt. 10, 16). This celestial,
               purest  prudence  differs  from  the  worldly  prudence  and  the
               human  respect.  Even  though  it  sees  everything  with
               simplicity, still it judges between good and evil as they really
               are before God.]]></page><page Index="307"><![CDATA[Holy  simplicity  abhors  lies.  Behaving  frankly  and
               sincerely  according  to  the  divine  oracle  «  yes,  no,  »  each
               congregant  will  avoid  the  spirit  of  falsehood  as  if  it  were  a
               pest of the soul. Not to expose simplicity and sincerity to risk,
               the  congregants  will  almost  never  make  use  of  compound
               mental abstraction, preferring to conceal through silence what
               is useless to manifest (C.R.).


                                    3. MEEKNESS

                       Meekness  is  a  daughter  of  holy  humility,  and  helps
               the people to become humble. Each Rogationist will be most
               vigilant in the exercise of this virtue, bearing in mind our Lord
               Jesus Christ's words: « Learn from me, because I am gentle
               and  humble  of  spirit  »  (Lk.  11,  28).  Looking  to  his  divine
               example,  each  congregant  will  excel  in  this  elect  virtue  in
               every  circumstance  by  controlling  and  mortifying  himself.
               Even  though  one  may  be  somehow  angry  without  sinning,
               while admonishing, for necessity, usually we have to be meek
               while  speaking  (we  should  almost  always  speak  in  a  low   307
               voice), while commanding, but over all while relating with our
               neighbor so that no one be scandalized (C.R.).

                       Each superior is warmly urged to keep himself calm
               and  perfectly  meek  in  every  event,  because  his  excitement
               rebounds on his subjects. It is written: « Yahweh was not in
               the wind, » for He is the spirit of eternal peace. The superior
               is not forbidden to feel the impressions of the events, to share
               them  intensely,  and  to  act  with  fervor  and  concern  in  the
               circumstances, but he must never lose his internal calmness,
               for  wisdom  consists  in  combining  concern  and  fervor  with
               internal quiet, which makes everything proceed in order. Here
               is the rub: the]]></page><page Index="308"><![CDATA[superior  will  never  act  by  passion,  which  is  the  source  of
               these vices: anger, furor, and wrath; if he feels them, he must
               not consent to them (R.S.).

                    Meekness!  St.  Francis  of  Sales  says  that  this  virtue
               should prevail over the others like oil floating on water. Such
               a  virtue  is  necessary  to  everyone,  but  especially  to  the
               superior for many reasons.

                    The first reason is good example. Irascibility is common
               among human beings, but emotions of impatience are more
               spread among the Religious. The hellish enemy exploits the
               persons' inclination to irascibility and impatience by working
               upon  it.  Unless  the  superior  prevails  over  this  passion
               perfectly  through  meekness,  he  is  unable  to  work  as  he
               should,  and,  therefore,  he  jeopardizes  his  subjects  on  the
               devil's  behalf!  Very  soon  his  impatience,  his  very  first
               emotions, outbursts, resentments, agitated talks, and the like
               unbridle each  Religious'  anger,  deranging  the  community  in
               such a way that the spiritual building collapses.
                                                                         308
                    What  a  disaster  the  untamed  irascibility  is!  Each  Su-
               perior  and  Religious  must  always  keep  in  mind  our  Lord
               Jesus  Christ's  sweetest,  gentlest  meekness.  He  performed
               the great work of the redemption through his meekness and
               gentleness  as  the  prophet  Isaiah  had  foretold.  He  went  to
               death  like  a  meek  lamb  without  opening  his  mouth  or
               complaining, and his meekness heartened his executioners to
               torment  him  in  so  many  ways.  Had  he  reproached
               vehemently his executioners for their cruelty, they would have
               stopped ill-treating him, and our redemption would have been
               interrupted. Oh, let us be infinitely thankful to our Lord Jesus
               Christ for his meekness, which let him work our redemption
               perfectly!  The  psalmist  says  to  God:  «  Yahweh,  remember
               David and all the hardships he suffered » (Ps. 132, 1): here,
               David is a symbol of]]></page><page Index="309"><![CDATA[Jesus, who included meekness among the beatitudes of the
               mount when he said: « Happy are the meek; they will receive
               what  God  has  promised  »  (Mt.  5,  5).  The  meek  soul  is  so
               self-controlled that it never yields to anger.

                    Each one will be meek, but the superior more. To reach
               this  beautiful,  beloved  virtue  which  draws  other  virtues  with
               itself, one must practice it and pray for it all his life long. We
               read: « In all that is right he guides the humble » (Ps. 24, 9): it
               means  that  God  guides  the  meek  superior's  actions  and
               words in the ways of His divine will, enabling him to lead his
               subjects to Jesus Christ (R.S.).


                        4. IN THE DAY-SCHOOLS FOR CHIDREN

                    Those  having  no  relationship  in  the  work  of  the  kin-
               dergarten or in the day-school will not concern themselves in
               them,  and  those  engaged  in  work  in  them  will  tend  only  to
               their own responsibilities. Each sister will refrain from giving
               the  children  images  of  saints,  or  anything  else,  as  well  as   309
               from petting them, talking, still less entrusting the day-school
               children with errands or delivering letters secretly, which is a
               serious  fault  worthy  of  punishment  and  a  worst  example.
               Likewise,  they  will  avoid  particular  affection  to  anyone  of
               them.  If  someone  happens  to  know  such  things,  she  will
               make it known to the mother superior.

                    The teachers of the day-school and of the kindergarten
               will  treat  the  pupils  and  children  lovingly  and  respectfully,
               warding off favoritism, or prejudice. Such a fault of the sisters
               would be greater than the fault of the other Religious who are
               not keeping in touch with the day-school pupils and children
               (S.D.D.Z.).]]></page><page Index="310"><![CDATA[The  sisters  appointed  to  an  institute  for  girls  must  be
               convinced that they must keep in touch with society, whose
               reasonable  needs  they  will  serve;  therefore,  they  will  be
               prudent, intelligent, and virtuous, imploring the Lord's help in
               order to cope with the people in accordance with obedience,
               and to increase the Institute's reputation through their work.
               Refined manners of sound education and courtesy are greatly
               recommended  to  the  sisters,  because  a  good  education  is
               like a sister to devotion (S.I.G.).

                    The  sisters  will  use  fine  manners  among  themselves,
               with the pupils, and the public, shunning from saying the least
               word offensive to anyone, even to a child. Once a week they
               will  read  the  fine  manner  book.  Besides,  they  will  make
               cleanliness  shine  in  the  house,  furniture,  household  goods,
               linen, and clothes.

                    Their  beautiful  mission  consists  in  gathering  civilized
               children and children of the people to train them in the work,
               to educate, edify, and teach them the duties of the Christian
               religion. They must carry out this holy mission with care and   310
               application,  by  edifying  the  pupils  through  their  own  good
               example, by emanating the odor of sanctity, of religious and
               civil virtues, and by making the children enchanted and won
               to  good  and  virtue.  Woe,  if  before  the  pupils  they  appear
               faulty,  angry,  lazy,  cool  in  piety,  and  conflicting  among
               themselves! Everything would be lost and the Heart of Jesus'
               interests would be betrayed! God would not bless them!

                    Likewise, they will not discuss the private affairs of the
               community  with  anyone, nor  will  they  disapprove  of  nor  will
               they speak ill of other sisters.

                    If they receive a tuition, the sisters are also bound in duty
               by justice to teach the pupils as loving, caring mothers, and to
               improve themselves through continuous]]></page><page Index="311"><![CDATA[education.  They  will  show  a  reserved  affection,  avoiding
               affectionate  displays  of  kissing  or  of  being  kissed  by  them
               (D.S.S.).

                    The sisters who run a day-school for girls are expected
               to be good examples of religious and civil life. Woe, if before
               children a sister appears reluctant to obey a superior! Woe, if
               they quarrel among themselves! Woe, if they speak ill of each
               other  with  outsiders!  It  is  like  killing  the  poor  pupils'  souls,
               ruining  the  day-school,  discrediting  the  institute  and  the
               sacred  garb!  If  it  happened,  would  they  have  any  hope  for
               vocations? In such a case, how much would they offend the
               most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus?  Haw  would  our  Lord  bless  and
               foster that dayschool?

                    For  that  reason  the  mother  superior  will  appoint`  the
               most perfect, polite, and learned sisters to the day-school for
               girls. This great responsibility weighs on her!

                    When  the  pupils  happen  to  refer  some  criticism  of  lay
               persons or priests against the sisters, they will brush off such   311
               things showing no resentment, but, to edify, they will add: «
               You are  wrong: these are honest .persons; they do not say
               such  things  »;  then,  dropping  the  subject  they  will  call  the
               attention to work, etc. (S.D.D.Z.).


                               5. EDIFYING EVERYONE

                    The sisters will strive to avoid the least voluntary defect
               and evade the involuntary ones as much as they can. They
               will keep in their mind that a virgin consecrated to Jesus must
               be  like  a  lily  among  the  thorns,  a  closed  garden,  a  sealed
               fountain  living  an  angelical,  immaculate  life  in  thoughts,
               wards, actions, and everything so that the aura of purity shall
               ascend to the celestial groom (D.S.S.).]]></page><page Index="312"><![CDATA[Besides  cultivating  spiritual  purity,  the  sisters  will  be
               most modest in their actions, avoiding lengthy talks with men
               or priests beyond what is necessary, to have eye contact, to
               have confidential talks, and to be alone with them for along
               time. The sisters will neither kiss each other, nor the children,
               nor the priest's hand; it will be enough to say to them: Bless
               me, Father. They will not lay hands on each other, nor on the
               children, nor let the children do so, but will avoid attachments,
               personal  affections,  preferences,  and  secret  friendship.
               Walking  through  the  streets  they  will  be  most  modest,
               avoiding laugh and idle talk (D.S.C.).

                    Because  the  sisters  of  active  life  are  in  the  midst  of
               society, it is their duty to edify the .people. They will bear in
               mind the Apostle Paul's sayings: 1. « Show a gentle attitude
               toward all » (Phil. 4, 5). Here, gentle attitude is the edifying
               behavior.  2. « For  I  have  an  obligation  to  all  people,  to the
               civilized  and  to  the  savage,  to  the  educated  and  to  the
               ignorant » (Rom. 1, 14). 3. « We do not want anyone to find
               fault with our work, so we try not to put obstacles in anyone's
               way » (2. Cor. 6, 3). In short, we have to behave in such a   312
               way that our ministry of charity and religion be not blamed nor
               discredited.

                    By  edification  the  sisters  command  respect  and  win
               many  souls  to  God.  None  of  them  will  develop  familiar
               relationship with anyone nor will she laugh confidentially with
               outsiders,  nor  will  she  speak  of  the  community's  private
               affairs with them.

                    The  sisters  will  observe  justice  by  paying  the  workers'
               legal wages; they will practice charity by avoiding to overwork
               the  laborers;  will  be  benign  with  them  by  abounding  in
               consideration and retribution.

                    Because all human beings are creatures of God and the
               price of the adorable blood of Jesus Christ, the sisters]]></page><page Index="313"><![CDATA[will respect all of those to whom they minister by internal and
               external  behavior,  even  though  these  persons  may  be
               miserable and abject.

                    Treating with people of rank, the sisters will pay the due
               respect and the refined, gracious, unaffected manners of the
               holy Church's teaching. When the sisters keep in touch with
               civil  or  state  authorities  in  occasion  of  their  visits  to  the
               institute  or  in  any  other  event,  they  will  pay  the  greatest
               respect  by  using  the  reverent  speech  which  is  due  to  their
               dignity.

                    Both in the cities and in the little towns, the sisters will
               foster among the pupils and the orphans the esteem for the
               king,  the  queen,  (1)  the  prefect,  and  the  mayor.  When  it  is
               required by society, they will send greeting cards to them and
               their  ladies  on  special  occasions,  such  as  their  saint's  day,
               birthday,  and  main  feasts  like  New  Year's  Day  and
               Christmas. It is always useful. In some occurrence they may
               send a gift such as devotions, children's small works, etc. It is
               excellent  .inviting  them  to  attend  performances  or  rewards   313
               after exams, etc. When a personality happens to fall ill, the
               community will be concerned, will get information, will let him
               know  that  the  community  is  praying;  during  the
               convalescence a cake or something else may be also sent.

                    All this induces esteem and affection; we, however, have
               to  do  so  not  for  human  protection  but  by  faith,  confiding  in
               God only. And yet, we have to use licit means to keep friendly
               relations  with  authorities  because  of  the  good  results  for
               God's  glory,  for  the  institute's  good,  and  for  the  persons  in
               authority,  who  are  led  to  form  a  good  opinion  of  the  holy
               religion along with its institutions (S.D.D.Z.).

                                IN THE LORD'S HOUSE

                    1  recognize  that  I  must  be  a  model  for  everyone
               everywhere, but above all in the church because it is the
               Lord's house.
                    Before  entering  the  Lord's  house  1  will  remember
               the  Holy  Spirit's  saying:  cWhen  you  enter  the  Lord's
               house, take care of your steps. * I will not enter it hastily
               and rashly, but at a sedate and recollected pace, making
               the  sign  of  the  cross  with  holy  water.  Then  i  will
               genuflect,  adoring  the  most  Holy  Sacrament.  When  1
               pass  before  the  holy  tabernacle,  1  will  genuflect
               reverently and recollectedly.
                    While kneeling in church I can rest my hands on the
               chair or the pew and my forehead on my hands in order
               to concentrate my thoughts, but without leaning against
               the  chair  or  the  pew.  Calm  and  recollected,  I  will  not
               engage in conversation with anyone; only when obliged
               by necessity I will speak in a low voice and briefly.     315
                    During the prayer in common I will pray with a low,
               contrite voice; when the rule or necessity lets us sit, I will
               do so decorously and modestly.
                    So  that  my  external  behavior  in  church  be
               well-regulated 1 will strive to be recollected in the divine
               presence  offering  praise,  thanksgiving,  petitions,  and
               love to the Lord.

                    When  the  people  enter  the  church  or  the  sacramental
               oratory they must pay reverence with faith, considering that
               they are in the presence of God, our adorable, beloved Lord
               Jesus Christ, the eternal king surrounded by the angels and
               the  saints  along  with  the  queen  of  heaven  and  earth,  who
               adore  Him  deeply.  Before  entering,  each  in  an  actitude  of
               faith, will think of what she is going to]]></page><page Index="316"><![CDATA[say  to  the  supreme  goodness  in  the  sacrament  while
               adoring  and  praying.  It  is  written:  <  Before  entering
               God's sanctuary, take care of your steps and avoid to be
               like  one  tempting  God.  »  They  will  be  recollected  and
               devout  in  the  presence  of  God  in  the  sacrament,  will
               increase  their  respect,  recollection,  devotion,  and  faith
               during the exposition of the holy host (S:D.D.Z.).

                    They will say the vocal prayers reverently, pausing,
               and  in  a  low  voice  which  expresses  internal
               compunction; cries, rash, and confused voices are to be
               avoided. They must concert the vocal prayers in order to
               learn how to say them properly, as by art (R.A.).

                    If  the  aspirants  go  to  a  public  church  to  assist  at
               mass or to listen to a sermon or to serve at the altar, they
               will  be  careful  to  be  for  the  people  example  of  great
               recollection and perfect modesty (R.A.).

                    Because  prayer  is  indispensable  for  sanctification
               and eternal life, the Little Retreat novices will cultivate a   316
               love  for  it,  praying  vocally  and  mentally,  as  our  Lord
               Jesus Christ taught us.
                    While  praying  vocally  the  novices  will  combine  in-
               ternal recollection with attention, speaking with a gentle
               voice  and  a  moving  tune,  which  induce  devotion  and
               recollection; they will avoid high and unpleasant tone of
               voice. They must keep in mind that vocal prayer is not a
               performance, a declamation, but a wail of the spirit: the
               wail of the mystical dove (R.L.P.).
                    The sister header of the vocal prayer at the choir will
               make  no  mistakes:  avoiding  too  high or  low  voice,  she
               will read with a moving tune to express compuction and
               contrition  of  heart,  as  well  as  to  express  the  wails of  a
               humble spirit. She is responsible for saying the prayers
               prescribed by the rule: if some prayer is omitted through
               her fault, she is responsible for it (R:L:P.).]]></page><page Index="317"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XIII

                       CONSENTING TO APPOINTMENTS

                   1 promise to accept any office to which my superiors
               deem to appoint me by obedience, humble and painful as
               it  may  be.  Much  more,  when  they  give  me  humble  and
               painful assignments I will be happier promising to carry
               them out exactly and attentively, even though 1 have to
               sacrifice  myself.  If  for  reasons  of  health  or  any  other
               valid reason I feel that 1 cannot accept the appointment, I
               will  submit  my  reason  to  the  superiors  humbly  and
               plainly, and follow their decision.



                       1.   ASSIGNMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY

                    As the working of the motor depends on each of its parts
               working in harmony, so the well-proceeding of a community
               depends on the exact execution of each of the assignments.   317
               It  follows  that  each  person  performing  her  task  with  the
               greatest  attention,  diligence,  and  effectiveness  is  of  great
               momentum  in  a  community,  because  it  enjoys  the  good
               effects  of  one's  duty  perfectly  fulfilled,  whereas  when
               someone is negligent in performing her duty, the whole house
               suffers its detrimental effects, either temporal or spiritual.
                    Each  officer  must  consider  her  task  as  related  to  the
               practice of the vow or the virtue of obedience. Because it is
               obedience  that  assigns  the  tasks,  each  one  must  receive
               them from the hand of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of the most
               holy Virgin Mary, who are our]]></page><page Index="318"><![CDATA[divine  superiors.  By  such  a  consideration  the  officer  will
               understand with how much loyalty, attention, diligence, and-
               love  she  has  to  perform  her  duties,  whose  fulfillment  is  a
               service to God, a religious act, and an execution of the divine
               will.  One  must  accept  any  office  with  this  faith.  The
               completion  of  one's  own  task  implies  as  many  acts  of
               obedience  as  many  are  the  actions  needed  to  perform  it;  I
               would  say  that  the  acts  of  obedience  are  as  many  as  the
               instants you need to perform the obedience; in addition, the
               proven  disposition  to  fulfill  one's  own  duty  deserves  the
               merits  of  obedience  continuously.  Accomplishing  well  one's
               own  assignment  is  like  accomplishing  an  important  part  of
               one's vocation (S:D.D.Z.).

                    The  young  probationers  will  be  employed  in  the  as-
               signments  necessary  to  maintain the  well-proceeding  of  the
               house. Each will be willing to receive the assignment in the
               spirit of holy obedience without desiring others he would like.
               They can only wish and ask for the humblest tasks, holding
               them  as  the  noblest  before  the  Lord,  but  even  in  this  case
               they must calmly leave the matter in the hands of obedience.   318
               Each  probationer  will  fulfill  his  own  task  scrupulously  and
               exactly; negligence is imputed to him as a serious fault. The
               community will say a prayer to the most holy Heart of Jesus
               every  day,  asking  help  for  the  well  fulfillment  of  the
               assignments.  Each  one  will  perform  his  task  in  the  divine
               presence  to  glorify  the  Lord  and  to  perform  his  will;  thus,
               fulfilling  one's  own  duty  will  be  meritorious  before God.  Oh,
               how  many  merits  a  youth  deserves  when  he  performs  his
               duty in the spirit of obedience, humility, and diligence!

                    Besides other punishments, those who are negligent in
               fulfilling their assignments may be deprived of or suspended
               from doing them (P.R.P.).

               punishment  is  most  sensible  and  suitable  to  produce
               repentance and amendment (S:D.D.Z.).

                    To be the most neglected and mortified the novices will
               compete  in  obedience,  charity,  and  humility,  seeking  for
               themselves  the  poorest,  humblest,  painful  things  or
               assignments. The humblest tasks will be given as reward or
               taken away as punishment. The novices will love and respect
               each other in a holy manner, each one seeking to relieve the
               others by  asking  for  herself  the  heavier  burdens  and  works

                    The  sisters  will  strive  to  be  diligent,  industrious,  and
               intelligent, trusting in the Lord and imploring his help.

                    Diligence  means  paying  attention  to  performing  every-
               thing  well  without  forgetting  anything.  Being  industrious
               means  working  willingly  and  avoiding  idleness,  because  by   319
               working quickly and actively we do many works, minding the
               community's  interests.  Intelligence  means  that  the  sisters
               themselves  have  to  find  out  the  best  way  to  make  things
               proceed well according to the rules and holy obedience.
                    Each  sister  will  fulfill  her  assignment  with  the  utmost

                    A  novice  may  be  appointed  to  the  kitchen  by  holy

               daily purchases be at her disposal in time. While cooking she
               will pay careful attention so that no thing be wasted and the
               Pious  Institute's  members  be  not  disheartened  for  ill

                    The sister cook will do her best while cooking. Her task
               is to maintain the life and strength of the sisters who work for
               Jesus and souls: thus, she may share in the good operated
               by  them  as  if  she  herself  were  working  together  with  them.
               She will beware of the least gluttony, to which the enemy of
               the  souls  could  tempt  her.  Being  always  in  the  divine
               presence, at the sight of the fire she will remember hell and
               the fire of purgatory in order to avoid any defect, to pray for
               the  conversion  of  sinners,  and  to  intercede  for  the  souls  in
               purgatory.  Utmost  cleanness  in  everything  is  greatly
               recommended (D.S.S.).

                    Each will be diligent in fulfilling her assignment avoiding
               to neglect or to waste anything. To keep the children and the
               people's respect alive, the sisters will not wear a soiled garb,
               nor  a  worn,  bruised  veil  or  covers,  but  will  be  very  neatly
               dressed even in the house (SlC:E.).

                    All  will  be  fond  of  cleanness,  which  is  not  against   320
               poverty. The people, clothes, rooms, and the whole house will
               be clean (C:R.).

                    True devotion is fond of cleanness (R:L.P.).

                    I  declare  that  I am ready  to receive  from  my  superiors
               any  assignment  they  decide  to  give  me,  even  the  humble
               ones,  and  to  fulfill  them  with  joy  and  readiness;  if  health
               reasons  or  any  other  valid  reason  are  against  this
               assignment, I will humbly submit my reason to the superior,
               and will follow his advice. I also declare that I am not attached
               to a particular assignment or work, therefore I will pretend no
               assignment of my liking because I am fond of and ready to
               perform what the superiors tell me to do (P.D:P.).]]></page><page Index="321"><![CDATA[Assignments  range  from  superior's  office  to  door-
               keeper's but all of them are for our Lord Jesus Christ, and the
               last assignment is like the first one, and the first like the last.
               No one is allowed to refuse or leave the assignment, on the
               contrary he will receive it from our Lord's hands, painful as it
               may be. No one will long for a nobler or less difficult job: if
               someone  wants  to  be  ambitious,  he  will  long  for  the  most
               abject, hurOble, and difficult job. Each will be full of good will
               to  exactly  fulfill  his  job,  following  the  rules  and  the  orders.
               When  someone  happens  to  be  absent,  he  will  inform  the
               superior for providing with a substitute, because no one can
               change  nor  meddle  with  the  job  of  others,  even  for  help,
               without permission. From necessity, however, it may be done
               until it is related to the supervisor (C:R.). (1).

                    I  promise  to  joyously  accept  from  obedience  any  job,
               even the humble or material or difficult or painful one, never
               refusing it; if health reasons or anything else are against, I will
               submit  them  to  the  superior  with  simplicity,  following  his
               advice.  I  also  promise  to  fulfill  the  assignments  with  care,
               attention, and exactitude admitting as of now that negligence   321
               or repeated faults in the fulfillment of my job be imputed to me
               and be punished, if necessary. I will prefer the most abject,
               humble  jabs  as  the  ones  that  fit me  better, and  will  ask  for
               them (D.P.).

                    While assigning the tasks the superior will pay attention
               to  each  person's  health,  skill,  and  disposition,  correcting
               those persons who long for a particular assignment or those
               who  do  not  want  to  leave  the  one  they  have.  When  the
               subject  may  be  satisfied  prudently,  the  superior  can  please
               him; the superior, however, will warn the subject to be ready
               to leave his job at any time he is asked to do so. Likewise, if

               strong enough to detach himself from it (R.C.).

                          2. OFFICES AND INTERNAL LIFE

                    The  novices  will  engage  themselves  in  the  practice  of
               active life with such a moderation and tranquillity of spirit that
               the  practice  of  contemplative  life  be  not  jeopardized.  Their
               service will consist in fulfilling the assigned tasks exactly. In
               the  morning,  the  novices  will  say  a  brief,  particular  prayer
               asking  God  for  enlightenment  and  grace  to  fulfill  the  daily
               tasks... They  will  strive  to  do their  duty  with  diligence,  love,
               humility, and loyalty.

                    The  Little  Retreat  novice  will  strive  to  be  always  re-
               collected in God, whatsoever her job may be. She will pray to
               God  not  only  at  the  beginning  of  the  day  to  win  the  grace
               necessary to fulfill her tasks, but she will also have a mind to
               do  everything  for  God's  greater  glory,  for  the  souls'
               sanctification, and for the sanctification of her neighbor.
                                                                         322
                    On this purpose, the novices will consider the fulfilling of
               the  tasks  assigned  to  them  as  deserving  the  maintenance
               and improvement of the pious .institute, which is committed to
               the  glory  of  the  most  holy  name  of  Jesus  and  to  the
               sanctification of souls. They will consider their tasks not only
               in themselves and in holy obedience, but also in relation to
               the  profit  of  so  many  souls,  the  good  results  in  so  many
               children,  and  the  aims  that  God  may  have  on  this  little
               charitable  institute;  as  well  as  in  relation  to  the  hopes,  the
               wishes,  and  the  prayers  concerning  the  fortunes  this  pious
               institute will have in the most holy
               Heart of Jesus.

                    After taking into consideration these topics, the]]></page><page Index="323"><![CDATA[novices will hold any work, painful and humble as it may be,
               as  sweet  as  it  is  glorious.  Sweeping  a  room,  cleaning  a
               casserole,  mending  clothes  will  be  great  when  they  are
               related to God's glory and to the souls' sanctification. Besides
               the  general  intentions,  the  novice  will  have  particular
               intentions about her tasks, considering fitting topics to lift up
               her mind to God.

                    For instance, if the sister is on duty to clear or wash the
               clothes, she may consider the cleanness the soul must have
               to be a dwelling worthy of our beloved Jesus Christ. If she is
               employed  on  sewing,  following  St. Magdalen  Dei  Pazzi  she
               may ask God for the conversion of as many sinners as the
               stitches she does, praising and blessing God as many times
               as  well.  If  she  is  employed  in  cooking,  she  may  consider
               divine providence's generosity in feeding his creatures or the
               celestial, eternal banquet where God feeds the elect with His
               glory. If she is a nurse, she will see our Lord Jesus Christ in
               any  sick  child,  remembering  our  Lord's  saying  on  the
               judgement day: cc I was sick and you visited me. » If she is
               watching  over  the  little  children,  she  will  meditate  on  how   323
               precious are the souls and how dearly Jesus paid for them. If
               she is a sacristan, she many lift up her mind to God and to
               the Holy Sacrament continuously.

                    Thus,  the  novice  will  strive  to  combine  the  practice  of
               active life with contemplation (R.L.P.). (2)

                        3. RULES TO RUN THE OFFICE WELL

                    1. We have to receive any task from God and the most
               holy Virgin's hands with faith and love, resolutely minding to
               fulfill it with attention, intelligence and care.]]></page><page Index="324"><![CDATA[2. Because we can do nohing without divine help as our
               Lord Jesus Christ said: (< For you can do nothing without me
               ))  (Jn.  15, 5), each  sister  should  invoke our  Lord, the most
               holy Virgin, who is our divine mother superior, the guardian
               angel, and the patron saints asking for enlightenment, help,
               and grace to fulfill well her own task. To achieve this purpose
               the sisters will say a vocal prayer in common, and each one
               will say it with fervor and entreating heart: Besides, each will
               pray  during  the  meditation,  the  Communion,  and  the  holy
               mass  as  well  as  in  the  unfolding  of  her  task;  through
               ejaculatory  prayer  and  invocations=she  will  ask  for
               enlightenment,  help,  and  grace  so  that  she  may  overcome
               the  difficulty,  see  clearly,  succeed  in  everything,  following
               obedience and divine will perfectly for her personal good and
               that  of  the  community.  When  this  prayer  is  made  while
               performing one's own task, it is always of great efficacy and
               draws special grace and enlightenment. The first invocation,
               however, will be to the most holy name of Jesus, who will rule
               all our actions well when we invoke him with faith.

                    We  have  already  said  that  each  person  has  to  ac-  324
               complish  her  task  not  only  diligently,  but  also  intelligently,
               understanding  and  performing  everything  well.  Dull,  idiot
               minds will never fulfill even the simplest task well, whereas an
               intelligent  mind  may  always  open  to  the  light  of  grace.  For
               that  reason,  please  do  not  accept  dull  persons  in  the
               community.  However,  those  who  for  lack  of  intelligence  do
               not know how to cope in singular cases, must learn to help
               themselves through remote and present prayer, which will be
               of  great  help  if  they  have  received  the  task  with  joy  and  a
               resolute mind to succeed. Each one has to help herself with
               prayer. When one finds herself in doubt or perplexity, besides
               calling upon Jesus' name she should resort to the Mother of
               Good Counsel,]]></page><page Index="325"><![CDATA[by saying for instance: < Mother of Good Counsel, for Jesus'
               sake,  your  beloved  son,  please  enlighten  me  on  how  to
               behave,  how  to  resolve)),  or  the  like.  The  invocation  to  the
               Mother of Good Counsel has been always effective beyond
               belief because it opens even the dullest minds.

                    Some  people  do  not  fulfill  their  tasks  exactly  because
               they have not received the assignment from obedience  with
               joy, a resolute mind, and faith, but also because they neglect
               remote and present prayer. For that reason, they cannot lay
               the  blame  on  incapacity,  but  on  their  negligence.  Besides
               being  prayerful,  each  will  be  mindful  to  give  thanks  to  the
               divine mercy for the good fulfillment of the task, and before
               going to sleep everyone will thank God for the enlightenment
               and the graces he granted them during the day to help them
               fulfill their tasks, begging pardon for their faults.

                    3. No one will refuse the task assigned nor will she be
               reluctant  to  accept  it,  but  she  will  receive  it  pleasantly  and
               quickly, regardless of whether she likes it or not. Neither will
               she  find  excuses  in  sickness,  which  often  is  mistaken  for   325
               selfishness. However, if someone faces difficulties in fulfilling
               her  task,  she  may  submit  everything  with  simplicity  and
               detachment to the mother superior, who will judge according
               to the Lord's enlightenment and the knowledge she has about
               the subject's disposition and state. At the end, the subject will
               follow  the  mother  superior's  decision;  if  the  assignment  is
               confirmed, she will receive it with faith from the hands of the
               Lord  and  the  most  holy  Virgin,  regardless  of  the  health
               reasons  or  anything  else,  being  sure  that  the  spirit  of
               obedience  will  win  enough  grace  from  the  Lord  for  her
               success.  If  she  surrenders  with  a  good  will  and  a  sincere
               mind and]]></page><page Index="326"><![CDATA[helps  herself  with  prayer,  she  will  be  able  to  fulfill  her  task
               perfectly.

                    4. If in fulfilling her duties by obedience and with joy or at
               least with resignation the sister is absent from religious acts,
               spiritual readings, etc. she loses no merit of the religious acts
               from which she is absent, she rather deserves double merit
               for  her  sacrifice.  Please  understand  that  the  community's
               members  share  mutually  and  equally  in  the  merits  of  the
               assignments, good works, and prayers; the one who performs
               her  task  well  in  the  eyes  of  the  Lord  is  performing  all  the
               assignments  of  the  others.  Because  the  community's  well
               being consists in the perfect execution of the duties of all, the
               person  at  fault  with  her  task  is  like  one  attempting  to  it,
               whereas  the  one  performing  her  task  well  is  like  one
               maintaining the whole house and, therefore, she deserves a
               reward  from  God.  For  instance,  the  sister  cook  who  does
               everything  on  time,  helps  the  community's  order;  if  she  did
               otherwise, the people would be unable to do their duties on
               time,  and  everything  would  go  upside  down.  Likewise,  the
               sister employed an the clothes works for the community's life   326
               and health; as a matter of fact, by being punctual she helps
               the  congregants  in  the  performance  of  their  religious  acts,
               discipline, etc.

                    It's  all  the  same  for  anyone  performing  her task  in  the
               community. Hence, each one must know with how much love,
               diligence, attention, intelligence, fervor, and faith she has to
               perform her task, how she has to receive it, and how she has
               to help herself through remote and actual prayer.

                    We have said above that the sister who is obliged by her
               duties to be absent from religious acts, must not get vexed;
               here we point out that the mother superior is]]></page><page Index="327"><![CDATA[obliged by canon law to provide such a sister with appropriate
               time for meditation.

                    5.  Each  sister  will  beware  of  dispersing,  losing,  or
               wasting the tools of her job; if it happens, she will confess her
               fault to the mother superior or the treasurer.

                    6.  To  have  the  necessary  provision  for  her  job,  each
               sister  will  appeal  to  the  mother  superior  or  the  supervisor
               without worrying, rushing, or pretending too much; when it is
               possible, the officer will do her best making shift, instead of
               claiming new objects, because everything must be done with
               sobriety and economy.

                    7. Everyone will avoid interfering with the task of others,
               except for emergency cases when no time or no opportunity
               is available to ask the permission.

                    8.  Not  even  momentarily  can  anyone  entrust  another
               with  the  task  they  have  received  from  the  mother  superior,
               except for emergency cases, as we have said above.        327

                    9. No one should long for high appointments by natural
               disposition nor will they use means and subterfuge to reach
               them. Is it true that a Religious may covet to be a superior or
               to be appointed to an office of command, and she succeeds
               reaching it? God forbid! It would be a pitiful ruin for the house
               and  the  institute!  May each  stand  aloof  from  such  a  hellish
               suggestion worthy of Lucifer, the father of pride, who wanted
               to stand out over all the angels!

                    10. When the mother superior is worried about the work
               to  be  done,  the  sisters  can  volunteer  to  do  some  hard  or
               humble work; in such a case competing and being available
               according  to  obedience  is  worthy  of  praise,  and  everyone
               must know that the hardest, humblest]]></page><page Index="328"><![CDATA[tasks are the most desirable for a humble, fervent Religious.

                    11.  The  lazy,  cowardly  youth  will  never  fulfill  her  task
               well, and this fact is a sign of a feeble vocation or none at all;
               therefore, she cannot be admitted to the taking of the sacred
               garb, but must be dismissed, unless she amends. Due to lack
               of  fervor  in  the  spiritual  life,  a  lazy,  coward  youth  is  even
               unable to sweep a room, light a candle, etc.

                    12. Those who are at fault in the fulfillment of their task
               must be exhorted and taught about how to perform it well. If
               they  are  stubborn,  they must  be  corrected by  penance and
               mortification.  In  such  a  case,  the  touchiest  penance  is
               depriving  the  lazy  person  of  her  office,  letting  her  eat  the
               divine providence's bread in idleness.

                    13. The mother superior, the teacher, and the treasurer
               will see to it that in the changing of the officers, the former
               one  will  hand  over  the  office,  explain  the  proceeding,  and
               leave everything in order to the new officer.
                                                                         328
                    14. The new  officer  will  never  censure  the  former  one;
               and  if  someone  did  so,  she  will  excuse  her!  Likewise,  the
               former  officer  will  never  censure  the  new  one;  furthermore,
               when  someone  is  against  her,  the  former  officer  will  speak
               well and excuse her by saying that she is doing better than
               herself.  This  way  we  keep  peace  and  the  Lord  blesses  us.
               May God forbid the great fault of censuring! By censuring, the
               transgressor would show she has not the religious spirit, but
               the world's and the devil's spirit!

                    15.  Everyone  will  keep  her  office  without  thinking  of
               resigning. If one feels herself unable to keep it any longer, but
               wishes humbler offices, she may pray, take]]></page><page Index="329"><![CDATA[counsel  from  the  spiritual  director,  submit  her  idea  to  the
               mother  superior,  and  then  will  follow  obedience.  Also  the
               mother  superior  must  behave  this  way,  always  with  pure
               intention (S:D.D.Z.).



                                         NOTES

                   (1) Each asphrant will be appointed to an office, and he wilt be most
               diligent in fulfilling his duty. No one will claim a particular office, but will
               humbly  accept  the one  that  obedience gives  him. Wishing and  asking
               the lowest office as the most honorable before the Lord -is allowed, but
               even  in  such  a  case  everyone  will  follow  obedience.  Negligence  in
               fulfilling  the  office  is  considered  a  fault  more  or  less  serious,  and  is
               punished even  with suspension  from  office. Each aspirant will comply
               with his duty and will be in the divine presence in the spirit of humility
               and obedience, as a practice of virtue. Oh, how many merits the aspirant
               gains when he fulfills his duty this way (R.A.).

                   (2) Each sister will be appointed to an office. The harmony of the
               house depends on the perfect fulfillment of the offices. Each Religious
               will commend herself to the most holy Virgin and to the guardian angel   329
               every day in order to comply with her office perfectly. Knowing that she
               is working for Jesus our Lord, the sister will apply all her attention and
               zeal. She will waste neither object nor time; on the contrary, she will be
               industrious and diligent. No one will get bored by her office nor will she
               refuse it, will be rather perseverant in it, changing her office only when
               obedience demands it.
                   Each  one  will  strive  to  be  in  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  all.day
               long, offering herself to him; even though she applies herself to various
               things, she  will  not lose the  divine presence  in her own spirit, but  will
               refer  everything  to  Jesus  crucified  and in  the  Holy Sacrament,  whose
               divine presence is always within us (D.S.S.).]]></page><page Index="330"><![CDATA[330]]></page><page Index="331"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XIV

                           DETACHMENT FROM RELATIVES

                   I  declare  that  I  mean  to  live  in  this  pious  Institute
               totally  detached  from  the  love  of  my  relatives  such  as
               parents,  brothers,  sisters  as  well  as  from  love  for  my
               native  country.  I  will  never  long  to  go  back  home,  not
               even for a short time. If for a good reason I am obliged to
               go,  I  will  submit  It  to  the  superiors  whose  advice  I  will
               follow exactly and submissively.
                   I will be also moderate either in writing or in claiming
               letters or news from them; when I write to them, I will be
               edifying  as  a  priest  and  Religious,  avoiding  too  much
               familiarity and allowing my letters and messages to pass
               through the hands of the superiors, as I have declared at
               chapter VII: B. Obedience.

                   When my relatives come to visit me, I will inform the
               superiors so that they may take part In our conversation,
               which  will  be  moderate  and  edifying,  because  of  my   331
               suggestions to do good and to attend the sacraments. I
               will  recommend  all  of  them  to  the  Lord,  especially  my
               parents and my nearest relations, avoiding, however, to
               have too much association with them, following our Lord
               Jesus Christ's saying:
               “Whoever comes to me cannot be my disciple unless he
               hates his father and his mother, his wife and his children,
               his brothers and his sisters, and himself as well” (Lk. 14,
               26);  and  to  Holy  Spirit's  saying:  “Listen,  daughter,  pay
               careful  attention:  forget  your  nation  and  your  ancestral
               home” (Ps. 45, 11).

                   Because  I  am  now  associated  with  the  brethren  by
               religious bonds stronger than blood, I will hold them as
               my  relatives,  saying  together  with  Jesus  my  Lord:
               “Whoever does what God wants him to do is my brother,
               my sister, my mother“ (Mc. 3, 5).]]></page><page Index="332"><![CDATA[The  aspirants  will  always  love  their  relatives  with  pure
               love  of  charity  and  piety  recommending  them  to  God;  still,
               they  will  begin  detaching  themselves  from  the  natural
               affections of blood. Those who are willing to belong totally to
               Jesus  by  consecrating  themselves  to  his  service  in  the
               priesthood or in the religious profession need to detach their
               heart  from  natural  love  for  relatives  and  creatures.  God  is
               jealous  of  the  souls  consecrated  to  Him:  He  wants  to reign
               alone  in  their  hearts.  Jesus  our  Lord  is  our  father,  mother,
               brother,  sister,  and  everything.  He  taught  us  this  holy
               detachment in various ways.

                    To accustom themselves to holy detachment, when the
               aspirants mention their family house they will never say my
               house,  but  will  say  my  relatives'  house,  because  for  my
               house they must mean the institute.

                    Since  the  relatives  in  their  letters  sometimes  use
               unbecoming  language  or  relate  griefs  and  stories  which  do
               not matter to the aspirants, a faithful summary of the letters
               relating everything of the aspirants' concern will be made and   332
               given  to  them,  and  the  aspirants  will  be  satisfied  with  that
               (R.A.).

                    The  novices  will  love  their  relatives  with  charity  and
               piety,  recommending  them  to  God  and  caring  for  their
               spiritual good, as much as they can (R.L.P.).

                    Charity  toward  our  neighbor  urges  us  to  love  our
               nearest, our relatives; but pure love of God and holy freedom
               of  spirit  urges  us  to  live  detached  from  all  creatures,
               especially from those who are connected by nature and blood
               and could prevent us from union with God. The novices will
               nurture  true  love  of  charity  and  piety  toward  their  relatives,
               especially  the  nearest  ones,  but  will  endeavor  to  have their
               heart detached from them to belong totally to Jesus, who is]]></page><page Index="333"><![CDATA[father,  mother,  brother,  sister,  and  everything  for  the  souls
               (R:L.P.). (1)

                    A  person  who  leaves  the  world  to  devote  herself  to
               Jesus Christ, must moderate the affections that bind or attract
               her  to  her  relatives  and  must  purify  her  natural,  legitimate
               love according to the virtue of charity and piety. She has to
               love  her  relatives  in  God,  without  natural  tenderness  and
               sensibility, but with strong and pure love recommending them
               to the Lord and asking him to bless, sanctify, and save them.
               The Daughters of Divine Zeal will not wish to see and write to
               their  relatives  often,  but  they  will  also  avoid  negligence  by
               writing now and then and by answering their letters. Either the
               sisters see their relatives in the parlor or write to them, they
               will behave and write as the Religious do. Through their talk
               and  writing  they  will  exhort  their  relatives  to  attend  the
               sacraments,  making  them  esteem  the  religion.  The  sisters,
               however,  are  not  allowed  to  have  connections  with  their
               distant relatives (C.D:D.Z.). (2)

                    The sisters will be detached from all the people and from   333
               everything,  seeking  Jesus  alone.  Not  worried  about  seeing
               their  relatives,  they  will  recommend  them  to  the  Lord
               peacefully. The sisters, however, must fulfill some filial duties
               of convenience and piety toward their parents (D.S.S.).

                    The  probationers  must  know  exactly  the  kind  of
               relationship  they  may  have  with  their  relatives.  They  must
               know that the beginning and the foundation of a true vocation
               is holy detachment from relations of blood; therefore, they will
               love  their  relatives  with  orderly  and  peaceful  affection  of
               charity, which consists in recommending them to God for their
               eternal salvation. They will also accustom themselves to hold
               all  human  beings  as  relatives,  because  we  all  are  brothers
               and sisters in]]></page><page Index="334"><![CDATA[Jesus Christ. Beginning from now on they must understand
               that  since  they  are  desiring  to  become  members  of  a
               community which holds the orphans as beloved sons, and the
               poor as beloved brothers, they must bear in mind our Savior's
               saying: ((Whoever does what my Father in heaven wants him
               to do is my brother, my sister, my mother)) (Mt. 12, 50); as
               well as the saying of Jesus to the one who wished to go back
               in order to bury his father: « Follow me and let the dead bury
               their own dead » (Mt. 8, 22). (PAR.). (3)





                                         NOTES

                   (1) As to my love for my parents, I promise that as soon as I enter
               the religion I will spiritualize it, praying to the Lord to sanctify, bless, and
               save them. I will have correspondence with them on their saint's name,
               on New Year's day, Easter, Christmas, and every time I have to answer
               their letters.                                            334

                   My  behavior  with  my  nearest  relations  or  benefactors  will  be  the
               same; I will exhort them to the good, using a language appropriate to
               -my vocation.

                   I  promise  to  never hurry my  visit to  my parents' house nor  to  be
               anxious to see them; when they come to visit me and obedience allows
               it,  as  a  Religious  I  will  receive  them,  out  of  respect  and  pure  love,
               behaving affably, affectionately, and kindly (D.P.).

                   (2) The parents' mall will be summarized and handled by the sister
               in  charge  of  it.  Each  sister  or  novice  or  probationer  will  be  glad  to
               observe  this  rule;  besides,  no  Important  thing  will  be  left  out  in  the
               summary.  This  rule  locks  the  door  to  the  world  and  to  the  devil,
               preserving  the  fortunate  souls  who  are  consecrated  to  the  celestial
               spouse * (C.D.D.Z./.

                   (3) The probationers will never long nor claim to go to the parents'
               house.  It  is  strictly  forbidden,  serious  cases  excepted.  To  meet  his
               parents at the parlor, the probationer will go along with]]></page><page Index="335"><![CDATA[the cleric assistant; such visits are allowed once a month to the close
               relations, such as parents, uncles, and aunts; any other visit is strictly
               forbidden.  In  these  circumstances,  the  probationers  will  behave
               according to their vocation, avoiding to prolong the visit and cutting short
               useless talk, in agreement with the cleric assistant. The probationer who
               is interested in his parents' good, exhorts them wisely and respectfully
               (P.R.P.).

                    LOVE AND OBEDIENCE TO THE HOLY FATHER

                   Through this 15th article and the following four I am
               going  to  declare  and  promise  things  of  the  greatest
               importance; even though they belong to the chapter VII:
               B,  which  is  concerned  with  blind  obedience,  still
               specifying them through five articles is more useful.
                   To begin with: as a Christian by Lord's mercy, as a
               priest  unworthy  of  the  Catholic  Church,  and  as  a
               congregant of an institute aiming primarily at increasing
               the priests, I declare that I will have the greatest respect,
               an  unlimited  subjection,  and  subordination  to  the  Holy
               Father. I will hold, love, and obey him as our Lord Jesus
               Christ up to my last breath. The Holy Father's interests
               will be my heart's living interests; his words, either said
               outside  cathedra  or  privately,  will  be  oracles  of  eternal
               salvation for me. His opinions and ways of thinking will
               be the rule of my opinions and the ways of my thinking,
               to which I will always conform myself. His sorrows and    337
               pains will be mine.
                   When  I  preach,  confess,  and  talk  I  will  instill  in  the
               people  these  feelings  of  unlimited  subjection  and  filial
               love toward Jesus Christ's vicar. The first intention I will
               put In the mass, thanksgiving, divine office, meditation,
               and  rosary  will  be  for  the  Holy  Father  along  with  his
               intentions.  When  he  issues  encyclicals  or  delivers
               speeches and I am fortunate to read them, I will conform
               myself  to  his  feelings  obeying  exactly  what  he
               commands or suggests. I will consider the Holy Father as
               sacred  and  venerable,  and  if  I  am  fortunate  enough  to
               see him, I will repute the opportunity of kissing his feet
               and  even  the  dust  on  which  his  feet  trample  as  my
               fortune.
                   I have declared all this for the following reasons:

                   1. Because I know that our Lord Jesus Christ wants
               us to honor, love, and obey his vicar as his own person.]]></page><page Index="338"><![CDATA[2.  Because the predominant spirit and the rule of
               this humble  institute command it.
                   3.    Because   I  feel   profondly  and   intimately  that
               such things  must  be.
                   4.   Because  the  perfect  subjection  to  the  Holy
               Father brings about the Lord's blessing on each institute
               and  each  soul, whereas  a lack of  this  subjection under
               the pretext of these distinction  ex cathedra  and  not  ex
               cathedra,  person and sacred character is the beginning
               of serious faults for the individuals and the beginning of
               ruin for the communities.




                    1.    PROMOTING OBEDIENCE AND LOVE TOWARD
                                THE   HOLY   FATHER

                   The  probationers  will  nurture  in  their  heart  the  most
               profound  respect  and  the  most  perfect  subjection  to  their
               immediate  superiors  and  to  the  ecclesiastical  hierarchy.  As   338
               we  have  God's  holy  fear,  so  we  must  have  the  superiors'
               reverential  fear.  Such  a  subjection  and  filial  fear  determine
               the humility and mold the spirit of the people who long to be
               members of a religious order. They will never speak ill of their
               superiors  nor  censure  their  behavior,  and  when  they  notice
               an evident defect, they will excuse them and avoid discussing
               them.  This  way  they  show  their  gratitude  for  the  good  they
               are receiving. The probationers will also keep in mind that the
               divine  precept:  «  Honor  your  father  and  your  mother  »  (Ex.
               20,  12)  implies  the  duties  toward  their  superiors  and  the
               prayer for them. Therefore, they should pray every day for the
               Holy Father, for whom they will nurture a particular transport
               of love, faith, and subjection; for their bishop, holding him as
               the one sent by God to the]]></page><page Index="339"><![CDATA[diocese they belong to; for the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and
               for their immediate superiors (P:R.P.).
                    The  Rogationists  of  Jesus'  Heart  will  be  very  loving,
               obedient  children  and  most  humble  subjects  of  the  holy
               Church, which is represented by the Holy Father, the Roman
               Sacred  Congregations,  the  prelates,  and  the  bishops  who
               have juridical power over their religious houses.
                    They  will  nurture  such  a  reverence,  subjection,  and
               greatest tender love as to reach even veneration toward the
               Holy  Father,  holding  him  as  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  whose
               vicar he is, and his word, either written or spoken, as Jesus
               Christ's word. They will make almost no distinction between
               ex  cathedra  and  not  ex  cathedra,  holding  even  the  Holy
               Father's  private  opinions  and  sentences  as  venerable.
               Heartily  concerned  with  his  vicissitudes,  pains,  and  works,
               they will recommend him to the most holy Heart of Jesus in
               their  prayer  in  common.  On  his  patron  saint's  day,  his
               birthday,  and  the  like,  they  will  present  their  homages  and
               wishes,  also  publishing  articles  through  the  institute's
               periodicals. While preaching or teaching Christian doctrine or
               educating the youths, they will inspire .love, reverence, and   339
               obedience to the Holy Father, giving lectures on the doctrine
               about the Roman pontiff and his infallibility, as well as calling
               to mind the ecclesiastical history's glorious events, which are
               related to the supreme pontiffs (C.R.).

                    Each superior will give example of unlimited veneration
               and  of  warmest,  sacred  affection  toward  the  Holy  Father,
               seeing to it that the whole community be devoutly happy for
               the  supreme  pontiff's  consolations,  but  sympathetic  for  his
               pains. He will encourage the people to read the Holy Father's
               encyclicals,  speeches,  and  above  all  the  dispositions  which
               bind them under the obligation of conscience (R:S.).]]></page><page Index="340"><![CDATA[2. THE PAPAL INFALLIBILITY

                    The  holy  Church  is  formed  by  those  who  believe  in
               Jesus  Christ,  and  who  acknowledge  the  supreme  pontiff,
               beginning with St. Peter, as the chief of the Catholic Church.

                    The holy Church is classified into two categories; those
               who teach and those who learn. They are united by faith and
               form  the  mystical  body  of  Jesus  Christ,  the  invisible  head,
               while the supreme pontiff is the visible one.

                    Those who teach consist of the Holy Father along with
               the bishops who are united with him. Those who learn are the
               believers who are baptized. Like children they are fed by the
               holy mother, the Catholic Church, with the doctrine and with
               the grace which comes from Jesus Christ's sacraments. So
               that  the  teaching  Church  could  exercise  her  .power  with
               divine  authority,  Jesus  Christ  endowed  it  with  his  eternal
               priesthood,  not  a  simple  power,  but  the  power  of  the
               sacrament  of  Holy  Orders.  Holy  Orders  bestow  an  eternal
               character  in  the  priest's  soul,  as  in  Jesus  Christ.  This   340
               character is conveyed by bishop to bishop and by bishops to
               priests through the ritual of the sacrament.

                    When a person is ordained a priest, he is endowed with
               the power to forgive the sins of the people who humbly repent
               and  sincerely  confess  in  the  sacrament of  reconciliation, as
               well as to consecrate the body and blood of Jesus Christ in
               the mass, distributing them to the faithful in the sacrament of
               the Eucharist.
                    All  this  is  clear,  sanctioned  in  the  holy  gospel,  and
               entrusted to the holy Church.
                    Were bishops and priests to depart from Jesus Christ's
               teaching or to teach errors, faith would be lost]]></page><page Index="341"><![CDATA[and  hell  would  prevail  over  it.  To  prevent  such  an  evil,  our
               Lord promised the Holy Spirit's assistance to the head of the
               holy Church, who is the legitimate guardian of the Evangelical
               doctrine and is supported by God in order to ensure that the
               faithful stand in the truth.

                   This  is  the  dogma  on  papal  infallibility,  whose  name
               makes an impression on many people, far they think of it as
               of  a  personal  impeccability  or  of  an  impossibility  of  being
               mistaken intellectually, in any case or circumstance. But the
               meaning  of  this  dogma  is  not  that.  As  a  human  being,  the
               supreme pontiff may sin as we do, and history gives us such
               examples.  Nor  does  the  dogma  means  that  the  pope  is
               unable to be mistaken or to blunder even when he publishes
               books  on theology,  because  in  such  a  case  he  would be  a
               private doctor, subject to error as anyone else.
                        Then, what is papal infallibility all about?

                   It  consists  in  this:  when  the  supreme  pontiff  defines
               some  truths  of  faith  or  dictates  some  rules  of  morals  ex
               cathedra, that is to say, as the universal shepherd of the holy   341
               Church,  then  God  gives  him  a  particular  assistance
               preventing  him  from  errors.  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  is
               God  equal  to  the  Father  and  the  Holy  Spirit,  promised  this
               assistance to the first pontiff St. Peter and to his successors
               so that they might teach uprightly both the rules of faith and of
               morals to those who depend on their ministry, either bishops
               or priests or faithful.

                   Nothing  seems  to  be  impossible  in  this  doctrine.
               Otherwise  it  would  be  like  saying  that  God cannot give  this
               particular  assistance  to  His  vicar  he  left  on  earth  as  His
               representative, as the chief of His Church, as the surest guide
               in  faith  and  morals  for  the  holy  Church's  members.  It  goes
               without saying that God is able to]]></page><page Index="342"><![CDATA[endow  the  head  of  the  holy  Church  with  this  particular
               assistance, not for his personal good, (1) but for the universal
               good of believers.

                    The  truth  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  promised  this
               particular  assistance  to  the  supreme  pontiff  for  maintaining
               mankind in faith and to strengthen it in good Christian morals
               is  clear,  definite,  and  evident  in  the  gospel.  To  deny  it  is
               temerity  and  stubborness,  not  the  process  of  a  rational
               person.

                    1n Mt. 16, 19 we read that Jesus said to Peter: « I will
               give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; what you prohibit
               on  earth  will  be  prohibited  in  heaven;  what  you  permit  on
               earth  will  be  permitted  in  heaven.  r  This  is  the  divine
               assistance in the rules of morals we are talking about.
                    In  Lk.  22,  32,  before  Peter  denied  Jesus  three  times
               (here is the personal peccability), Jesus said to him: « When
               you  turn  back  to  me,  you must  strengthen your  brothers.  »
               Before going to death, he said to his apostles: « Satan has
               received permission to test all of you, as a farmer separates   342
               the wheat from the chaff. But I have prayed for you, Simon,
               that your faith will not fall)) (Lk. 22, 31-32).

                    Raised from the dead, our Lord Jesus Christ appeared
               to  the  apostles,  and  to  make  Peter  repair  his  three  denials
               asked him three times: « Simon, son of John, do you love me
               more than these? » « Yes, Lord,)) he answered, « you know
               that  I  love  you.))  Jesus  said  to  him:  «  Take  care  of  my
               lambs.)) A second time Jesus said to him, « Simon, son of
               John, do you love me?)) « Yes, Lord,)) he answered, « you
               know that I love you.)) Jesus said to him, « Take care of my
               sheep.))  A  third  time  Jesus  said,  «  Simon, son  of  John,  do
               you love]]></page><page Index="343"><![CDATA[me?)) Peter became sad because Jesus asked him the third
               time « ~Do you love me?)) and said to him, < Lord, you know
               everything; you know that I love you!)) Jesus said to him, «
               Take  care  of  my  sheep))  (Jn.  21,  15-17).  The  sheep
               represent  the ecclesiastics,  who  generate  the  faithful  to  the
               life of grace; the lambs represent the faithful.

                    Our  Lord  appointed  the  supreme  pontiff  to  feed  souls
               and  pledged  to  assist  him  as  his  vicar  on  earth  so  that  he
               may provide the faithful with a goad, holy pasture. God was
               able  to  give  this  particular  assistance,  it  was  convenient  to
               give  it,  and  he  has  being  giving  it  for  over  20  centuries;  in
               fact,  no  supreme  pontiff,  even  though  guilty  of  unbecoming
               behavior, was mistaken in his teaching of faith and morals.

                    Had it been otherwise, what would have happened to the
               Church of Jesus Christ? Unity of faith and rules of morals for
               the good and eternal life would have long since been lost! In
               order  to  maintain  the  teaching  in  faith  and morals,  the  holy
               Church,  through  the  Holy  Father,  allowed  entire  nations  to
               depart from faith through their fault rather than to compromise   343
               the  principles.  It  happened,  for  instance,  when  Henry  VItI
               asked to annul his marriage with Catherine of Aragon and to
               approve his union with Anne Boleyn.

                    Owing  to  its  divine  institution,  the  holy  Church  and  its
               pontificate has prevailed over the persecutions, especially in
               the first three centuries, always standing firm in union with his
               legitimate chief, according to the promise of -Jesus Christ to
               St. Peter: ((And so I tell you: you are a rock, Peter, and on
               this  rock  foundation  I  will  build  my  Church,  which  not  even
               death will ever be able to overcome)) (From the letter to the
               friends).]]></page><page Index="344"><![CDATA[3. DEFINITION OF THE DOGMA
                             OF PAPAL INFALLIBILITY (2)

                    A  word  of  life  has  been  pronounced  in  the  Vatican
               Council; a word, which three hundred million Catholics longed
               for, has started going all over the world.

                    It is an enactment of truth, a watch word centralizing the
               Catholic  children  around  unity  of  faith,  the  seal  of  a  belief
               1900 years old, the beginning of a new moral regeneration of
               mankind.  Oh,  no  one  is  able  to  hear  it  without  feeling  his
               heart  beating  with  celesial  exultation.  It  is  expanding
               throughout the world. No sooner does it come from the mouth
               of God's one thousand priests, the faithful echo repeats the
               gentle expression in the four corners of the world.

                        Infallible! Rome's gentle breezes echo.
                        Infallible! Cities, people, and nations answer.
                        Infallible! Sea, sky, and stars repeat.
                        Infallible! Paradise's angels sing.
                                                                         344
                    Oh, God's mysteries! Today, Christ's bride has set up a
               scepter before which the people must bow their head, the just
               in  gladness,  the  injust  in  anger:  the  scepter  is  the  papal
               infallibilty's sacred dogma, indisputable defense of his divine
               rights.

                    Today, impiety received the most terrible defeat from the
               moral  power  it  tried  in  vain  to  shake  on  its  firm  rock.  Oh,
               God's  mysteries!  We  have  witnessed  how  the  depraved
               society  got  up  as  a  man  alone  in  his  frenzy  against  this
               invincible  power,  throwing  against  it  the  hellish  fiercest
               arrows.  Today  was  the  time  when  frenzy  seemed  like
               touching the highest point of its madness: so many sects in
               error, so many different unbelief joined each other to knock
               down the base of all authorities. Human impotence!]]></page><page Index="345"><![CDATA[Today,  a  different  result  appears  before  the  eyes  of  all
               Catholics. Christ's bride holds its head high on the failure of
               the  dust.  Almost regardless  of  the  waves  of  apposition,  the
               Church always achieves its aims, it is always a winner. The
               world  seemed  so  agitated  as  if  to  impede  that  word  from
               coming  out  of  the  Vatican;  there  was  a  moment  when  the
               earthly powers seemed to be opposing its great design; but
               God  came  down  to  help.  By  now,  the  earthly  powers  are
               under  the  incubus  of  a  mysterious  hand,  they  are  about  to
               lacerate each other, intercrossing one another with a vortex
               of  wars  .and  blood;  (3)  Jesus  Christ's  Church  alone,  the
               gentlest mother of mankind, looks at the failings of the human
               beings  from  its  highness,  running  to  save  them  from  the
               abyss. Yes! It already begins its great work; the world sees it
               advancing majestic and writing on the .papacy's diadem this
               word that orders afresh the moral life of the peoples: infallible!
                    Hail, o divine word! Expected for many centuries, today
               you  elate  us  with  superhubman  jay.  Touched  and  reverent,
               we kneel down before you. We join the Catholics' universal
               vow,  and  looking  at  Peter's  infallible  cathedra  we  say:  we
               greet  you,  immortal  Pius  IX,  the  universal  Church's  doctor,'   345
               Christ's  vicar,  the mystical  bride's  sublime guardian,  Peter's
               boat's celesial pilot; at last, we greet you, glorious pontiff, that
               in 24 splendid years sublimated your name, which is a new
               pearl in the coming history and a sacred glory of posterity; we
               greet you, loving father, and with the five regions of the earth
               we salute you five times great! Five times infallible!

                             4. THE PAPACY IN LEO XIII

                    ...When  the  social  vertigo  was  at  its  summit,  when  the
               storm of human fortunes threatened to overthrow Peter's]]></page><page Index="346"><![CDATA[boat  along  with  the  .people's  hopes  of  well-being,  a  great,
               splendid, shining star appeared in the clear sky of Rome. The
               prophetic saying ((Light in the sky)) sent forth its rays and for
               25  years  rarified  darkness,  illuminated  minds  and  hearts,
               cooled down brutal passions, induced esteem and respect to
               the  Church  of  Christ,  spreading  the  truth  and  religion.  It
               helped  afflicted  humankind,  lifted  up  prostrated  hopes  to
               heaven, reminded human beings of their duties toward God,
               toward  themselves,  and  toward  their  neighbor.  It  provided
               thousands  of  people  with  spiritual  well-being,  calling  the
               attention  of  the  powerful  to  the  importance  of  the  respect
               which  is  due  to  the  papal  authority,  as  the  base  and  the
               guarantee of any civil authority.

                    'If  the  Papecy's  age-long  institution  were  nothing  else
               than  a  human  institution,  the  difficulties  that  opposed  the
               pontiff 'Leo XI14's glories would have been insurmountable.
               But Church and papacy are not human, but divine institutions:
               they  have  a  vigor  of  their  own,  always  new,  active,  young,
               renovating itself when it seems to be dying out. Church and
               papacy are the miracle of God's hand, the great unshakable   346
               building cemented by the blood of God-man, who swore once
               forever to Peter, the first supreme pontiff: cc And so I tell you:
               you are a rock, Peter, and on this rock foundation I will build
               my  church,  which  not  even  death  will  ever  be  able  to
               overcome)) (Mt. 16, 18).

                    The great pontiff, whose loss we mourn, showed again
               the  infallibility  of  this  divine  promise  that  never  failed  in  19
               centuries.  Born  pontiff  under  severe  test  and  tribulation,  he
               inherited the holy cross that his glorious predecessor, Cross
               from  Cross,  left  to  him.  He  embraced  the  cross  willingly,
               swearing to die over it rather than to come to terms on the
               Church's rights.]]></page><page Index="347"><![CDATA[The papacy's moral power, through Leo XI-11, prevailed
               over earthly powers: it was not only a rapprochement of the
               peoples, but also of kings and emperors as representatives of
               their nations; God's marvelous ways always reach the same
               aim through different paths!

                    God once showed that the Church's spiritual power may
               turn itself intro so strong an earthly power as to get the upper
               hand. The severe Hildebrand, moved by the omnipotent spirit
               of  God,  throws  down  the  emperor  Henry's  forces. Firm  and
               unshakable, he leaves the king crying outside the door of his
               castle  in  sackloth  and  ashes,  and  then  admits  the  humble,
               trembling,  and  tearful  king  into  his  presence.  At  last,  he
               forgives and rehabilitates him.

                    Many people will say: those were different times. Today
               civil and military powers are stronger, and the papacy must
               be  subordinate.  No,  gentlemen!  Today,  the  papacy  is  as
               strong as it was in the Middle-Ages. His two hundred million
               children,  at  a  sign  of  the  Haly  Father,  would  become  two
               hundred million crusaders, and would not shrink from giving   347
               their life for the pope in the battlefields.
                    However,  this  is  not  the  Church's  army.  Peter  knows
               how to handle the sword, but from the time Jesus Christ told
               him: « Put your sword back in its place... Don't you know that
               I could call on my Father for help and at once he would send
               me  more  than  twelve  armies  of  angels?))  (Mt.  26,  52-53).
               Since  then  the  papacy  has  understood  its mission  on  earth
               and the weapons it must use to win the people.

                    Leo  XII,I  understood  very  well  this  divine  mission.  He
               grew warlike with the strongest spiritual weapons. He put on
               the  breastplate  of fortitude  and  constancy,  the  shield of  the
               evangelical  doctrine  along  with  holiness  of  its  rights,  the
               helmet of the Catholic faith's greatest ideas,]]></page><page Index="348"><![CDATA[and brandishing the double-edged sword of the divine ward,
               he entrusted himself to the spirit of wisdom and to Christian
               meekness, entered the struggle, and won.

                    -  We  won't  go  to  Canossa  -  the  most  illustrious
               state-man of the German empire said; but he went twice: first,
               when  he  was  compelled  to  meet  the  just  requests  of  the
               empire's Catholics; second, when he put the controversy with
               Spain about the Caroline Islands in the wise arbitration of Leo
               XIfI.  In  such  a  circumstance,  the  MiddleAges  saw  the
               Church's power standing out among the nations, and seemed
               to be rising again.

                    Gentlemen,  what  made  this  poor,  unarmed  man  so
               powerful  before  the  rules,  who  by  principles  and  systems
               were the most alien' to the Catholic religion? What was inside
               this old man who in 25 years attracted not only the greatest
               enthusiasm  of  his  faithful  subjects,  but  also  the  admiration,
               the respect, and perhaps the affection of non-Catholic nations
               as  well  as  of  celebrities?  How  this  frail,  candid  man
               fascinated in such a way that the rakish world thrilled twice   348
               with reverence, pity, and almost filial care on the occasion of
               his sickness?

                    To answer this question, we put another one. How can
               we  explain  that  nineteen  centuries  ago,  a  .poor  fisher  from
               Galilee,  known  as  a  shy,  weak  man,  bare-footed  and
               bare-headed enters the Rome of the Caesars, resides there,
               and plants the seeds of a doctrine before which the idols of
               the Pantheon would be reduced to dust? The Church is God's
               power,  this  is  the  mystery;  the  supreme  pontiff  is  a
               human-divine being, the vicar of the Godman.

                    When  the  Italian  parliament  began  discussing  the
               iniquitous bill on divorce, Leo's heart was pierced by a sharp
               sword. He wrote a most learned, imposing encyclical]]></page><page Index="349"><![CDATA[pointing to the deadly consequences of a iaw contrary to the
               principles of morals and social order.
                    Once,  while  talking  to  the  cardinals  about  the  impious
               bill, his voice fainted suddenly, a painful Kiccuip came out of
               his chest, and tears came down from his eyes. Jesus' vicar
               exclaimed  in  tears:  «  Not  even  my  last  gray  hairs  are
               respected; they do not spare me such a deadly blow! )) A few
               months later, the unvanquished Leo subsided into the bed of
               his last sickness.
                    Gentlemen, was Leo XII~I a martyr? Did the people who
               cooperated  in  driving  him  to  the  tomb  feel  a  beneficial
               remorse? I do not know; a mysterious comparison, however,
               hits me.

                    When  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  betrayed  by  Judas,
               condemned  by  the  impious  Jews,  and  nailed  to  the  cross
               breathed  his  last  crying  aloud,  a  beneficial  change  of  heart
               resulted in a few. One of the two thieves crucified at Jesus'
               side,  touched  by  the  patience  of  that  just  one  who  died
               forgiving  his  enemies, repented,  acknowledged  him  as  God
               and  asked  that  he  be  allowed  to  share  in  his  kingdom.   349
               Contemplating at the foot of the cross the celestial features of
               the divine victim, the centurion exclaimed: < ~He really was
               the Son of God! » Some of the Hebrews who were standing
               there came down from the hill beating their breasts!

                    Recently,  Jesus  Christ's  vicar  died  after  a  wretched,
               crucified life inside the walls of his uninterrupted dwelling, and
               his last day appeared to be a rehearsal of the judgment on
               the reprobate and the elect.

                    Many adversaries of the papacy, who opposed the pope
                through  the  press,  and  others  who  disagreed  because  of
                different  religious  ideas  awakened  exclaiming  before  the
                venerable remains of the sacred, illustrious dead: c He really
                was Jesus Christ's vicar! » But, others remained

               impassive!  There  are  Hebrew  crucifiers  that  persist  in  their
               devilish hate against the pope, whatever may be his name,]]></page><page Index="350"><![CDATA[Pius  or  Leo  or  Gregory;  others  are  hopeless;  others  run  to

                    From the unlimited subordination and subjection to
               Jesus  Christ's  vicar  I  want  to  draw  out  a  perfect
               submission  of  intellect,  heart,  and  will,  as  well  as  the
               highest  reputation  and  respect  toward  the  Roman

               acts,  and  decrees.  Everything  a  Roman  congregation
               says or decrees or decides upon or manifests will be like

                    (1)  In  1907,  when  the  Abbot  Combe's  book  on  La  Salette  was
               condemned, our padre wrote exhorting him, who was a friend of his. to
               submit himself to the authority. Among other things he said: «When we
               face  certain  contradictions  or  admonitions  from  highest  ecclesiastical
               authorities, such as the Roman congregations, we must highly stand in
               awe,  be  profoundly  humble,  and  devoutly  prudent  because  they
               represent  the  Holy  Father.  In  these  events  we  must  not  consider  the
               circumstances that brought about that admonition or contradiction from
               the  Church's  prelates.  God  makes  use  of  so  many  tools,  but  the
               decisions of the Church's high prelates are the work of the Holy Spirit
               governing the Church. By renouncing our judgment we have to reprove
               with a will what the Church reproves.» Since the Abbot Combe had a
               mind to write a biography of Melania, our padre pointed out the outline of
               the  work,  but  concluded:  «The  holy  Church's  judgment  excepted,  in
               which  I  believe  more  than  in  my  eyes  and  hands»  (Letter,  Aug.  15.

                       I  declare  that  I  will  hold  the  ecclesiastical
               hierarchy  as  holy  and  celestial,  being  highly  respectful
               and subject to the holy Church's prelates, especially the
               cardinals  and  the  bishops;  to  the  former,  as  to  the
               Church's  princes,  and  to  the  latter,  as  to  the  apostles'
               successors, the highest priests of Jesus Christ's Church,
               the vigilant guardians of the mystical Israel.

                       I  will  always  speak  well  of  the  holy  Church's
               prelates. If someone had evident defects, I will excuse or
               conceal them. As unworthy as I am, I will pray to God for
               the  holy  Church's  illustrious  prelates,  especially  for  the
               cardinals and the bishops who are governing.

                       Since  this  humble  order  is  endowed  with  the
               particular grace and privilege of having the Ecclesiastical   353
               Sacred  Alliance  of  the  holy  Church's  most  illustrious
               prelates as well as of the clergy, I declare that I will have
               at  heart  this  Sacred  Alliance  In  order  to  foster  our
               Institute as much as I can.
                       Finally, as a professed member of the Evangelical
               Rogation  of  Jesus'  Heart,  I  declare  that  through  the
               order's prayers I will ask the most holy Heart of Jesus to
               always  send  out  learned,  holy  cardinals  and  prelates
               along  with  bishops  full  of  excellent  virtues  to  the  holy
               Church and to the dioceses.


                    The  ecclesiastical  hierarchy  is  the  high  pyramid  God
               planted  on  earth.  It  challenges  the  centuries,  rarefies
               darkness  of  human  errors  with  its  splendor,  watches  the

                         OBEDIENCE TO ONE'S OWN BISHOP

                    In a special way and more than the other bishops I
               promise to honor, love, respect, and obey with humblest
               submission  the  bishop  of  the  diocese  where  I  reside,
               because  the  community  depends  on  him  canonically.
               Whether our order Is by law diocesan or not, (1) I mean to
               respect and hold the rights that papal bulls or canon law
               give  to  the  bishops  on  the  order  and  its  members,
               because  these  rights  bind  me  to  perfect  subjection,
               esteem, respect, love, and trust. I will hold the bishop as
               superior  general  or  mayor  within  the  bounds  and  the
               exercise of these rights and relative duties, obeying and
               respecting him by preference.

                    The  congregants  will  hold  the  holy  Church's  most
               eminent  cardinals  and  prelates  as  the  holy  Church's
               princes and lords.
                                                                         355

                    They  will  highly  esteem  the  bishops,  holding  them  as
               the successors to the apostles as well as the ones that the
               Holy  Spirit  appointed  to  govern  Jesus  Christ's  Church.
               Above all, they will esteem, revere, and love the bishops of
               the  dioceses  where  we  have  houses,  obeying  and
               respecting  their  orders  in  everything  concerning  their
               competence (C.R.).
                    The  superior  of  the  house  will  show  great  respect  and
               subjection  to  the  ordinary,  paying  to  him  the  community's
               wishes  on  his  saint's  day,  New  Year,  Christmas,  etc.  and
               respecting his orders humbly, simply, and prudently (R.S.).

                   (1)  Keep  in  mind  that  our  padre  was  writing  in  1910,  when  the
               canonical approval of the orders was only a wish; in practical terms, they
               were pious associations depending on the Messina ordinary.]]></page><page Index="356"><![CDATA[356]]></page><page Index="357"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XIX

                    OBEDIENCE TO THE INSTITUTE'S SUPERIORS

                   To conclude the declarations I made in the chapters
               XV-XVIII about the practice of holy obedience along with
               subjection,  subordination,  esteem,  and  affection toward
               the  ecclesiastical  hierarchy,  I  pledge  my  obedience,
               respect,  esteem,  love,  and  trust  in  this  institute's
               superiors  as  an  immediate  norm  of  my  actions.  The
               institute's  superiors  are  the  superior  general  and  his
               representatives who have power over me.

                   Not  only  will  I  be  a  dependent  subject,  but  also  a
               loving  son  in  Jesus  Christ,  holding  dependence  and
               subordination  in  the  highest  esteem  and  considering
               them as the  base of the Institute's existence and of my
               religious life.

                   To  honor  the  high  order  of  dependency  God
               established  when  He  created  humankind  and  society,   357
               under  which  the  human  beings  find  safety  and  truth  in
               depending on each other; I will glory in my dependence. I
               will also glory in it to honor our Lord Jesus Christ, who
               made  himself  subject  to  his  creatures,  teaching  and
               establishing  dependence  on  ecclesiastical  and  civil
               authorities in order to abate human pride, as the psalmist
               said: « Let the nations know they are only men » (Ps. 10,
               21); as well as the apostle: « Every high priest is chosen
               from his fellow-men and appointed to serve God on their
               behalf, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins » (Heb. 5. 1).

                   I will hold my subordination and affection toward the
               holy Father, the sacred congregations, the holy Church's
               prelates,  and  the  ordinary  as  a  false  subordination,
               unless I am a perfect subordinate and have sincere filial
               affection toward my immediate superiors. In reference to
               the people who have no love for neighbor, St. John says
               If you do not love your neighbor whom you see, how can
               you claim that you love God, who Is Invisible? Likewise I
               will say to myself:]]></page><page Index="358"><![CDATA[how can I be respectful, obedient, and loving toward the Holy
               Father  and  the  Church's  prelates  who  are  far-off,  if  I  do  not
               esteem,  obey,  listen  to,  love,  nor  want  to  be  subject  to  my
               Immediate superiors, who are always with me? I will repute any
               feeling  of  reaction  to  my  superiors  and  their  orders  as  the
               beginning of a revolt prompted by Lucifer, who rose against the
               divine power and now upsets the communities by rousing the
               spirit of pride in the subjects.
                   If a lay-brother (1) is appointed to the superior's office, as
               some  institutes  do  for  practice  of  humility  and  obedience,  I
               declare that I will listen to, obey, and be subject to him with the
               same spirit of subordination, respect, and humility which is due
               to any other superior.
                   I  will  greatly  trust  in  the  superiors,  sometimes  confiding
               my pains and temptations to them with simplicity as a son does
               with his father, believing that by doing so God will bend, giving
               me his consolations. Great as may be the gifts I was given by
               God,  I  will  be  like  a  child  in  my  relation  with  the  superiors,
               putting  myself  in  their  hands  In  order  to  follow  the  celestial
               teaching: « Whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like
               a child will never enter it » (Mc. 10, 15).
                   By  behaving  so  I  mean  to  avoid  seeking  consideration
               from my superiors in order that they may command and direct   358
               me  freely.  On  the  other  hand,  I  will  glory  in  obeying  and
               listening to them, remembering the words that Jesus spoke to
               his  disciples  and  to  those  who  are  legitimately  placed  at  the
               head  of  the  Church:  «  Whoever  listens  to  you,  listens  to  me;
               whoever rejects you, rejects me » (Lk 10, 16).
                   I  will  receive  advice  and  Instructions,  admonitions  and
               reproaches  or  penances  from  my  superiors  as  though  Jesus
               Christ himself were acting or speaking through their mouth.
                   When  priests  or  brothers  or  young  students  are  around
               me,  I  will  fear  setting  bad  examples  of  insubordination,  and
               strive to consolidate both the authority and the government of
               my superiors whenever it is possible, even with my abasement
               and  humiliation.  When  I  see,  greet,  call,  treat,  answer  my
               superiors  or  I  receive  their  orders  and  the  like,  I  will  use  the
               signs of respect that are customary in our institute.
                   To conclude this important article, I resolve to never long
               for any power. On the contrary I will try to refuse it with humility
               and prudence when my superiors want to confer]]></page><page Index="359"><![CDATA[it  on  me;  however,  If  holy  obedience  obliges  me,  I  will
               accept it- Should the Lord permit my election, and holy
               obedience compel me to accept any power or jurisdiction
               on others, since now I declare that I will repute myself as
               the servant and the last one of all, feeling myself obliged
               to  be  the  first  in  the  observance,  In  the  practice  of
               religious  virtues,  in  self-denial,  and  to  settling  good
               example. Should It happen, I will hold my office with fear
               and  trembling,  praying  continuously  to  the  Lord  for
               enlightenment  and  help.  I  will  keep  in  mind  the  holy
               writers' rules  about prudence, discretion, and charity In
               governing  as  well  as  about  the  zeal  and  strength
               necessary to avert or atone offences to God, to eliminate
               abuse, oppose slackening even In small things, and put
               down the obstinate.



                              1. THE DIVINE SUPERIORS
                                                                         359
                   The  present  and  future  Rogationists  will  hold  the
               Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jests  and  the  most  holy  Immaculate
               Mary  as  immediate,  absolute,  effective  superiors  always
               present in the midst of them, even though invisible, according
               to the proclamations on July 1 and 2, 1913. The Rogationists
               will see them in each order, command, and direction of the
               superiors who have power over them. Reading the rules and
               the  constitutions,  they  will  learn  each  article  as  though
               Immaculate Mary were reading and instilling them on  behalf
               of the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus. Before any common action,
               they  will  say  the  Latin  prayer  Sacratissimum,  holding  as  a
               secret of the institute the ineffable grace of the double, divine,
               absolute,  effective,  immediate,  celestial  superiority,  invisible
               to  the  senses,  but  visible  in  the  external  direction  of  the
               legitimate superiors. Everyone will keep it in his heart saying:
               my secret is for me, as well as: it is]]></page><page Index="360"><![CDATA[right  to  conceal  the  secret  of  the  king  and  of  the  queen  of
               heaven (Rules according to the two proclamations).

                    The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  never  forget  that  on
               Dec.  8,  1904  (50th anniversary  of  Immaculate  Conception's
               dogma)  the  institute  of  Divine  Zeal  elected  and  solemnly
               proclaimed  Immaculate  Mary  as  the  everlasting  owner,
               mother, teacher, as well as the absolute, effective, immediate
               superior of the Daughters of Divine Zeal's community... From
               then on, the Daughters of Divine Zeal have been holding and
               will  always  hold  the  most  holy  Virgin  as  the  effective,
               absolute,  immediate,  but  invisible  superior  oaf  this  least
               order.  They  have  sworn  to  hold  the  visible  superior  as
               Immaculate Mary's vicar, binding themselves to honor, love,
               and obey her as the most holy Virgin.

                    The  noble,  holy  office  of  Immaculate  Mary's  vicar  first
               resides in the mother superior general; second, in the house
               mother superiors, who are subject to the mother general. To
               enjoy  the  good,  singular  fortune  of  having  the  most  holy
               Virgin as the effective superior, the Daughters of Divine Zeal   360
               must  honor,  love,  and  obey  the  house  mother  superior  and
               the mother general as the most holy Virgin Mary (C.D.D.Z.).


                            2. RESPECT AND OBEDIENCE

                    I  promise  perfect  obedience,  subordination,  holy  af-
               fection,  and  profound  respect  toward  the  institute's  present
               and  future  mother  superior,  holding  her  as  the  most  holy
               Virgin's vicar. I promise the same obedience, subordination,
               respect, and holy affection toward anyone, either sister or lay-
               person, who is appointed to direct or supervise me, holding
               that  the  legitimate  direction  or  surveillance  is  coming  from
               God anal the most holy Virgin (D. P.).]]></page><page Index="361"><![CDATA[The novices will consider their superior as their mother,
               nurturing filial love and respect for her. First, they will show
               love and esteem by obeying exactly and by anticipating her
               thoughts and wishes; second, by recommending her to God
               particularly;  third,  by  helping  her.  They  will  avoid  to  disgust
               her even in the least things, knowing that whoever disgusts
               the superiors, disgusts God. If the mother superior happened
               to  fall  into  defects,  the  novices  will  not  wonder  nor  talk  to
               each other about it, because no one is perfect; they instead
               will excuse and fervently recommend her to God (R.L.P.).

                    I  promise  to  put  myself  under  the  obedience  of  the
               institute's director and his legitimate representatives, whether
               they  are  lay-persons  or  younger  than  myself  or  imperfect,
               holding them as Jesus Christ and behaving like a child with
               docility  and  simplicity  of  heart  when  they  guide,  direct,
               command,  admonish,  and  correct  me.  I  also  mean  to
               renounce  and  silence  my  will,  judgment,  and  opinion  when
               they are in bad terms with my superior's will, judgment, and
               opinion.
                                                                         361
                    Never  will  I  be  desirous  to  command,  reaching  to  be
               superior over anyone, to be  praised, and esteemed. On the
               contrary,  I  have  a  resolute  mind  to  sanctify  myself,  seek
               Jesus, and totally belong to him by loving the last place, by
               being disappointed, ignored, and humiliated (P.D.P.).



                             3. SEEKING THE LAST PLACE

                       No  one  will  long  for  honor  and  directorship,  but  will
               avoid honor, approbation, and superiority because ambition is
               the soul's death; only when obedience appoints a Rogationist
               to an office, he will accept it (C.R.).

                       You shall not desire the superior's office. Desiring]]></page><page Index="362"><![CDATA[the  superior's  office  and  intriguing  to  have  it  (God  forbid!)
               would be a serious fault worthy of God's indignation! It would
               be eternal damnation for you and ruin for the house! Instead,
               everyone  will  dislike  having  the  superior's  office  or  any
               superiority over other people. No one will forget that we have
               to  seek  the  last  place,  as  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  taught  us.
               Even though he was God, he put himself in the place of the
               evildoers, dying between two murderers! Only whoever loves
               the  last  place,  will  be  told:  «  Come  on  up,  my  friend,  to  a
               better place » (Lk. 14, 10). Were a Religious to long for the
               superior's office or for any superiority, God would give him no
               help and he would be mistaken over and over again.

                    When  God's  will  is  manifested  by  ballot,  or  obedience
               compels the Religious to accept the superior's office or any
               position  of  superiority,  the  Religious  must  feel  himself
               unworthy  of  it  and  receive  it  from  the  Lord's  hands  as  a
               burden and a punishment of his sins; he must consider the
               appointment  as  an  office  of  service  toward  others,  not  a
               superiority.  From  the  very  beginning  he  must  conform  to
               God's adorable will and trust in the infinite goodness of the   362
               most holy Heart of Jesus for the best execution of his duty,
               saying specific prayers to the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, to
               the  angels  and  the  saints  to  win  the  grace  and  the
               enlightenment he needs (R.S.).

                    The mother-superior will meditate on these words of our
               Lord Jesus Christ: whosoever is first among you, shall be as
               the  last  one.  On  one  hand,  she  will  keep  the  superior's
               authority  in  order  to  train  the  Religious  in  the  virtues  of
               humility,  obedience,  and  subjection;  on  the other hand,  she
               will  intimately  repute  herself  as  the  servant  of  the  others,
               doing everything for them in humility and mortification, giving
               the  best  things  to  the  sisters,  but  keeping  the  worst  for
               herself. The mother superior]]></page><page Index="363"><![CDATA[will be careful to always set good example, knowing that this
               is  her  chief  duty,  while  her  setting  of  bad  example  -  Jesus
               forbid! - makes the souls turn aside from the right way of their
               vocation  and  herself  guilty  before  God.  Specifically,  the
               mother  superior  will  edify  the  subjects  through  her  exact
               observance of the rules, through meekness in transacting the
               institute's  business,  patience  in  suffering  opposition,  perfect
               obedience to the major superiors, silence, prayer, practice of
               virtues, and mortification. In short, the mother superior must
               be more virtuous than the sisters. She will love her subjects
               as  tenderly  and  strongly  as  her  own  daughters,  regarding
               them with indulgence in their faults, and providing them with
               everything  they  need.  Besides,  she  will  comfort  and  teach
               them  with  love.  When  they  happen  to  be  at  fault,  she  will
               correct them by penances that are apt to their amendment. At
               last, she will recommend them to God, the most holy Virgin
               Mary,  and  the  glorious  Patriarch  St.  Joseph  for  their
               perseverance and sanctification (R.L.P.).


                                                                         363
                         4. BEING GOD'S REPRESENTATIVES

                    Each  Rogationist  superior  will  consider  in  the  light  of
               faith  that  he represents  the divine  superiors.  Fully  aware  of
               this  truth,  he  will  humbly  consider  it  in  his  daily  prayer  and
               colloquies with our Lord.

                    By  considering  the  obligation  and  the  duties  that  the
               office requires of him, the superior will humble himself before
               God;  every  day  and  in  each  circumstance,  he  will  implore
               divine help in the name of Jesus and enlightenment from our
               Lady of Good Counsel.

                    He will consider himself the servant of all, directing to the
               Lord his actions, corrections, exhortations, and everything he
               does to improve his beloved children in]]></page><page Index="364"><![CDATA[Jesus  Christ  spiritually  or  temporally.  In  fact,  whatever  he
               does in the name of the Lord and the most holy Virgin is a
               service  to  the  people  who  depend  on  him  in  the  house  of
               God. He will be comforted by the example of our Lord Jesus
               Christ, who said: « Anyone who wants to be great among you
               must  be  your  servant,  and  anyone  who  wants  to  be  first
               among you must be your slave, just as the Son of Man came
               not to be served but to serve » (Mt. 20, 27-28).

                    The  superior  must  combine  the  notion  of  service  with
               superiority  so  prudently  as  to  make  the  subjects  pay
               subjection, obedience, respect, trust, and holy love.

                    He  will  demand  everything  through  love,  trust,  and
               reverential fear. But he will be unable to inspire such things,
               unless he is a model of religious virtues, perfect observance,
               spirit  of  sacrifice,  love,  and  paternal  charity.  May  each
               superior  meditate  on  this  article,  because  the  success  or
               failure proceeding from his direction depends on it (R.S.).

                    Be humble, meek, prudent, fervent, recollected in Jesus,   364
               observant  and  diligent  in  correcting  mildly  and  strongly.  Be
               the last, but demand obedience and observance (D.S.S.).

                    Prudence must be one of the superior's chief virtues; it
               regulates the others and consists in understanding well and in
               being  aware  of  everything,  either  spiritual  or  temporal.  It
               prevents the members of the community from rushing, from
               going  to  extremes,  leading  them  to  take  the  happy  mean.
               Prudence dissimulates, is forbearing, patient cautious, wise,
               vigilant, experienced, and always watchful.

                    However,  the  superior  must  distinguish  between  holy
               and  profane  prudence.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  we  find  a
               prudence coming from the Lord's spirit and a false prudence
               coming from the world's. The former acts for God's]]></page><page Index="365"><![CDATA[glory  and  for  the  good  of  the  souls,  controls  itself,  dis-
               simulates,  and  counsels.  Human prudence  instead,  acts  for
               human aims and earthly interests. It puts aside God and the
               good  of  the  souls  for  human  respect  and  personal
               attachment.  The  superior  will  detest  human  prudence  as  a
               pestilence  and  shall  not  seek,  think  of,  or  dissimulate  far
               human respect, personal regard and liking. It does not mean,
               however, that we have to pay no special courtesy toward the
               people of high rank, because prudence is not a rough virtue
               and  doing  otherwise  would  be  imprudence.  The  prudent
               superior  will  never  come  to  terms  with  his  conscience  for
               anyone  and  for  whatever  reason,  and  in  dubious  cases  will
               resort to prayer and advice. To spare the community serious
               damages coming from imprudence, the superior will pray for
               prudence  every  day  to  the  adorable  Lard  Jesus  Christ,  the
               Holy  Spirit,  and  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  who  is  called
               Virgin most prudent. He will often read the wisdom books to
               know  how  the  Holy  Spirit  praises  the  virtue  of  prudence
               (R.S.).

                    Meek, benign zeal and charity's gifts, which are neces-  365
               sary to the people in power, do not prevent him from being
               unshakable  when  conscience,  rules,  and  prudence  require
               so.  In  such  a  case,  after  praying,  considering  things  before
               God,  and  taking  advice,  the  superior  will  be  impregnable,
               unless circumstances change substantially and  sin does not
               take  place.  Meanwhile,  he  will  pray  that  his  consistency  be
               well accepted by those who are concerned with it (R.S.).

                        LITURGY OF THE HOURS, HOLY MASS,
                                  AND COMMUNION

                   Until  now,  as  a  priest  I  felt  myself  obliged  to  pay
               particular  attention  and  devotion,  as  well  as  to  be
               recollected in the recitation of the holy office and in the
               celebration  of  the  divine  mysteries.  From  now  on,  as  a
               congregant  of  an  institute  that  specifically  aims  at
               increasing the Catholic priesthood, I promise with God's
               help  to  double  my  attention,  devotion,  fervor,  and
               recollection  in  the  recitation  of  the  canonical  hours,  in
               the celebration of the holy mass, and the sacred rites.

                   I will pace the recitation of the prayers with contrite
               heart,  taking  delight  in  the  loftiness  of  the  divine
               expressions,  in  the  prayers,  and  the  readings.  I  will  do
               my best not to delay any canonical hour to a later time.
               While reciting the prayers, my intention will be to honor
               the  saint  of  the  day,  to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy   367
               Church,  to  obtain  divine  mercies  on  our  communities
               and the souls In purgatory as well as to convert sinners
               and  to  foster  the  interests  of  the  most  holy  Heart  of
               Jesus. When the breviary is becoming worn I will ask the
               superior for a new one. (1)

                   As to the mass, which this institute holds in special
               esteem, I will consider it as the most sublime mystery, it
               really is. Because I am unworthy and want to be always
               aware  of  my  unworthiness  of  ascending  to  the  altar,  I
               mean  to  spend  all  my  life  in  a  continuous  preparation
               and  thanksgiving  for  the  celebration of the  tremendous
               sacrifice  and  for  the  holy  Eucharistic  Communion.  To
               prepare myself, before the mass I will kneel and pray for
               some  minutes  according  to  our  constitutions,  avoiding
               any talk or distraction. While celebrating, I will pace the
               pronunciation  of  the  words,  will  be  recollected  In  the
               divine  presence  as  best  I  can,  and  will  exactly  observe
               the rubrics without looking at the people.]]></page><page Index="368"><![CDATA[To avoid making mistakes or leaving out some part or changing
               things  with  each  other,  I  will  prepare  everything  before  the
               celebration, following the ordo. Were I at even Involuntary fault.
               I will charge myself with that, asking the superior for a penance.
               Mindful of the well proceeding of the mass, I will admonish the
               altar boy, even severely if it is necessary, when he rushes the
               words or is distracted.
                   After the celebration I will make a thanksgiving of at least
               20  minutes  in  the  church  or  in  the  sacristy.  Sometimes,
               however, I will be available for charity or the works of ministry,
               never  accepting  coffee  or  anything  else  before  ending  the
               thanksgiving.  When  people  offer  something,  I  will  refuse  by
               sincerely saying for public edification: « We take nothing before
               the mass thanksgiving. » I will make part of the thanksgiving by
               reflection, the remainder either by reflection or by prayer or by
               recitation of the canonical hours.
                   While  giving  thanks  for  the  mass,  I  will  be  Intimately
               recollected in God's divine presence making acts of adoration,
               offering, contrition, and love In order to win graces for myself,
               the  Institutes,  the  Church,  and  all  as  well  as  to  win  from  the
               most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  many  saints  to  the  Church,  to  the
               social classes, and to the clergy. Helped by God, I will celebrate   368
               the mass every day, doing my best to do so even when I travel.
               If health or travel reason prevents me from celebrating, I will be
               calm and humble before the Lord, conforming to the divine will
               in  peace  and  receiving  Holy  Communion  if  I  am  able  without
               great prejudice.
                   I  leave  the  special  intention  of  the  holy  mass  to  my
               superiors,  who  may  dispose  of  it  as  they  want,  unless  I  am
               under  obligation  of  conscience  to  fulfill  engagements
               contracted  previous  to  my  entrance  in  the  institute.  (2)  When
               the special intention is at the superior's disposal, I will put my
               own intentions in the general fruit of the mass also under the
               special  intention,  but  under  condition  because  the  probable,
               common opinion is that the mass' special fruit is infinite, and
               therefore  It  may  meet  all  the intentions.  My  intentions  are  the
               ones mentioned above on the recitation of the canonical hours.
                   Since  this  institute's  priests  apply  the  priceless  special
               fruit  of  the  masses  for  the  institute's  spiritual  and  temporal
               needs or for the souls in purgatory, I will not seek offerings]]></page><page Index="369"><![CDATA[for masses, on the contrary I will renounce them. When
               convenience obliges  me  to  receive  such offerings I  will
               hand them over to the superior, specifying the names of
               the donors, their Intentions, and everything else. (3)

                    I will be greatly concerned with the celebration of the
               liturgies, only performing the office that holy obedience
               assigns to me, but avoiding a better office to satisfy my
               pride  because  it  would  be  like  profaning  holy  things.  I
               will  also  study  the  rubrics  of  any  religious  service,  as
               much as I can.



                                    1. HOLY MASS

                    Each  community  of  sisters  will  attend  the  daily  cel-
               ebration of mass. If daily mass is not available in a place, the
               sisters will open no house there.
                    The Daughters of Divine Zeal must hold the sacrifice of   369
               the mass in the greatest esteem. They should consider it as
               the  bloodless  repetition  of  Calvary's  sacrifice,  holding  that
               one mass is enough to redeem millions of worlds owing to its
               infinite value.
                    To win spiritual and temporal graces for God's glory, for
               the good of the holy Church, the whole world, and their own
               sanctification  the  sisters  will  attend  the  mass  with  faith  and
               hope.

                    Through  their  faith,  the  sisters  will  see  during  the
               celebration  of  the  holy  mass  immense  rivers  of  graces  and
               blessings coming out of it and expanding all over the Church
               and the world. They will see Jesus as victim and priest who
               repeats  the  mysteries  of  his  life  from  the  time  of  his
               incarnation up to his death, resurrection, and ascension. They
               will  see  Jesus  who  fulfills  the  aims  of the  sacrifice  such  as
               adoration,  propitiation,  thanksgiving,  and  prayer.  During  the
               celebration  of  the  holy  mass  Jesus  pays  to  the  most  holy
               Trinity the homage of all creatures,]]></page><page Index="370"><![CDATA[adores the divine attributes on our behalf, and offers himself
               to the most holy Trinity as victim of infinite satisfaction for the
               graces the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit grant. Being
               the powerful mediator, he implores graces and mercies.

                    We must contemplate this view of faith during the holy
               mass, joining Jesus Christ in his adoration, satisfaction, and
               thanksgiving  for  any  grace  we  receive,  and  asking
               innumerable graces for us and for all.

                    Since  the  whole  Church  (militant,  purifying,  and
               triumphant) draws advantage from the mass, we have to offer
               it  in  union  with  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  for  the  Church
               triumphant,  for  the  heavenly  beings'  honor,  glory,  and
               thanksgiving;  for  the  Church  militant,  so  that  it  may  flourish
               with holiness, that sinners may become converts, that infidels
               may enter the Church, and that ministers of mystical harvest
               along with any good work super abound. We should offer the
               holy mass with feelings of mercy and charity for the Church
               purifying, for the souls in purgatory so that the prayers may
               super  abound,  the  Most  Precious  Blood  of  our  Lord  Jesus   370
               Christ may overflow, purify the purgatory's prison, and lift to
               heaven the souls who are longing for it.

                    Careful  attention  must  be  paid  to  our  offerings  of  the
               mass for so many intentions as well as to the five Gregorian
               masses we offer during the year for the liberation of all souls
               from purgatory. Such masses will be never left out.

                    Please be united with the adorable Heart of Jesus during
               the  mass  and  have  great  faith,  great  hope,  great  charity  to
               win innumerable graces for yourselves, the pious institute, the
               holy Church, souls, and the whole world.]]></page><page Index="371"><![CDATA[Special attention must be paid to the persons who offer
               the mass. These people are: our Lord, the celebrant priest,
               and  the  faithful attending  the mass  with  faith  and  love.  The
               sacred  authors  say  that  those  who  do  not  receive  grace
               during the mass owing to negligence, lack of faith or devotion
               will never receive any (S.D.D.Z.).

                    While  attending  the  great  sacrifice  of  the  mass,  the
               novices  will  imagine  themselves  together  with  Our  Lady  in
               sorrow on Calvary at the foot of the most holy cross. That is
               the time to offer satisfaction to the Most High for their faults,
               to adore the divine majesty, to thank him for the, graces they
               have  received,  and  to  humbly  petition  the  graces  of
               sanctification  and  perseverance  for  themselves  and  for  all
               (From Oria Novices' Directory).

                    The congregants will hold the sacrifice of the mass in the
               greatest  esteem.  (4)  Holy  mass  is  a  main  means  to  win
               mercies  and  graces  from  God  as  well  as  to  perform  one's
               own duty of adoration and thanksgiving to God. The priests
               will strive to celebrate mass every day. Even while traveling,   371
               they  will  do  their  best  and  manage  things  in  order  to  say
               mass. The Rogationists of Jesus' Heart are bound in duty to
               prepare  themselves  for  the  mass  celebration  through  a
               remote  and  immediate  preparation  as  well  as  to  do  an
               after-mass-thanksgiving  of  at  least  15  minutes.  This  pious
               institute's  congregants  will  offer  the  special  fruit  of  the  holy
               mass  for  the  order  and  for  its  members,  living  and  dead;
               therefore,  they  will  not  seek  offerings  for  the  celebration  of
               masses,  but  will  give  others  priests  the  offerings  they  may
               have. This way the special fruit of the mass may be applied
               every day for the order's spiritual and temporal needs as well
               as  for  the  souls  in  purgatory  and  for  the  benefactors.  The
               brothers will attend holy mass with recollection and devotion
               every day (C.R.).]]></page><page Index="372"><![CDATA[2. HOLY COMMUNION

                    What are the dispositions required of the probationers for
               receiving  Holy  Communion?  To  tell  the  truth,  the  young
               candidates  to  religious  life  are  the  sons  of  men  with  whom
               Jesus in the holy Sacrament delights to be (Prov. 8, 31). The
               most holy Eucharist has been called bread of the angels, and
               the probationers must be like angels by innocence and purity
               of life when they receive the most Holy Communion.

                    This  little  community's  probationers  will  make  of  their
               whole life both a continuous preparation and thanksgiving for
               the  most  Holy  Communion,  because  they  cannot  improve
               their  religious  vocation  without  receiving  Communion
               frequently. The preparation will be in common and in private
               in the spirit of humility and love.

                    After  purifying  and  detaching  his  heart  from  the  world
               through the observance of the divine law and holy confession,
               the  probationer  will  excite  ardent  love  for  Jesus  in  the
               Sacrament as well as intimate acknowledgement of his own   372
               misery and unworthiness before receiving Holy Communion.

                    What  is  love  all  about  but  longing  to  possess  the
               beloved?  This  little  community's  probationers  will  prepare
               themselves  to  receive  Holy  Communion  by  exciting  in
               themselves  such  a  longing  to  possess  the  infinite  treasure.
               Jesus in the Eucharist is bread satiating the famishing, but he
               leaves  fasting  the  unhappy  souls  that  are  not  hungry  and
               thirsty for him.

                    After receiving the Eucharist, the probationers will bend
               profoundly,  then  will  go  to  their  place  with  eyes  down  cast
               and  their  arms  folded.  Kneeling  upright  and  recollected  as
               best they can in the presence of God, they will  meditate on
               the living Gad dwelling within them,]]></page><page Index="373"><![CDATA[they will adore him in deep silence, will offer themselves as a
               holocaust,  and  pour  forth  their  thanksgiving  along  with
               expressions of love.

                    The time after Communion is extremely precious. It is an
               opportunity  to  win  graces  for  ourselves  and  others.  The
               probationers will profit by it. With humility and trust they will
               implore from the supreme goodness in the Sacrament many
               graces for their sanctification, the holy Church, the salvation
               of  souls,  this  institute,  this  community,  and  the  most  holy
               Heart of Jesus' interests. Both in the feasts and in summer
               time the probationers will prolong their thanksgiving (P.R.P.).

                    The  aspirants  are  free  to  receive  Holy  Communion  on
               the  days  suggested  by  their  confessor.  They  must  be
               convinced that no other means is more efficacious than daily
               Communion  to  improve  their  vocation  and  sanctification,
               provided  they  receive  it  with  pure  conscience,  due
               preparation,  and  thanksgiving.  On  these  conditions,  daily
               Communion is an always burning fire that lightens the flame   373
               of divine love.

                    The aspirant must consider that if he is so fortunate as to
               become a priest, he will receive Holy Communion every day
               in the celebration of the divine mass. Why then shouldn't he
               start now .this union of love with Jesus, supreme goodness?
               Of whom is the aspirant depriving himself the day he does not
               receive  Holy  Communion?  If  we  considered  the  infinite
               treasure,  the  celestial  lover  we  receive  in  the  Communion,
               how could we give him up even once? O candidates for the
               Evangelical Rogation, please approach the Eucharistic table
               every  day.  Feed  yourselves  with  the  bread  of  the  angels,
               unite  yourselves  to  Jesus,  and  you  will  be  holy,  good
               evangelical workers of his Church!

                    It goes without saying that we should be recollected,]]></page><page Index="374"><![CDATA[modest,  and  thankful  while  receiving  Holy  Communion.  But
               here we only point out that thanksgiving will last at least 15
               minutes,  and  will  start  after  the  prayer:  «  Here  I  am,  my
               beloved goad Jesus », etc. At the noon prayer the aspirant
               will make an additional brief thanksgiving, but during the day
               he will never forget the priceless gift he has received, being
               always united in love with Jesus (R.A.)!


               a) Dispositions

                    I call the Daughters of Divine Zeal's full attention to this
               most  important  topic,  because  their  sanctification  and
               salvation as well as their institute's improvement and firmness
               mainly depend on it.

                    Through  living  faith  and  spiritual  intelligence  the
               Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  consider  and  understand  the
               great mystery of our Lord Jesus Christ, who drawn by excess
               of  divine  love  becomes  .bread  in  order  to  feed  us  with   374
               himself, becomes one with us in order to transform us in him,
               giving us his divine life.

                    They will understand that the Eucharistic Communion's
               effects are strictly connected with the individual dispositions.
               They have to consider this tremendous truth. If one is in the
               state of mortal sin while receiving Communion, she eats and
               drinks  her  condemnation  according  to  the  words  of  the
               Apostle  Paul;  she  commits  sacrilege,  and  the  Eucharistic
               Communion becomes poison for her.

                    To  avoid  at  any  cost  and  sacrifice  an  additional  harm
               which  strikes  more  easily  those  who  receive  Holy  Com-
               munion  frequently,  we  have  to  consider  such    harm.  It
               happens when a religious person approaches the Eucharistic
               table  with  certain  imperfections  such  as  arrogance,  pride,
               stubborn  attachment  to  her  own  will  and  opinion,  grudge,
               dislike for the mother superior and unwillingness]]></page><page Index="375"><![CDATA[to  respect,  obey,  and  love  her,  and  she  does  not  want  to
               acknowledge  nor  to  correct  these  imperfections.  To  these
               interior  indispositions  we  also  add  lack  of  simplicity  and
               sincerity due to malice, simulation, and falsehood as well as
               disobedience,  negligence,  indifference  in  meditation  and
               prayer, dissipation, lack of internal and external silence, and
               any deliberate, frequent failure.

                    How  a  person  may  consecrate  to  the  Lord,  but  full  of
               failings,  defects,  and  indispositions,  receive  him  in  the
               Eucharist?  What  kind  of  meeting  can  the  sweetest  loving
               Jesus, who is fond of the soul, and God, who is full of virtues
               and  infinite  holiness,  have  with  the  alienated  person?  How
               displeased Jesus will be! In these conditions, what profit will
               the  person  derive  from  such  a  meeting?  By  God's  right
               sentence  that  person  will  become  more  and  more  blind,
               responsible  and  debtor  toward  God,  stubborn,  angry,  and
               impatient  as  well.  Thus,  that  person  will  go  losing  spiritual
               sensibility,  going  from  indifference  and  dimness  to  more
               serious  sins  and  sacrileges,  as  well  as  losing  her  vocation   375
               and  being  lost  for  ever,  unless  the  Lord  shakes  her  with  a
               stroke  of  his  triumphant  grace  (which  happens  seldom)  or
               with a serious tribulation through sickness or the like.

                    May each Daughter of Divine Zeal watchfully beware of
               approaching the sacred table and receiving Holy Communion
               while  having  an  upset  conscience  or  an  arrogant,  obstinate
               heart full of even venial sins, because they will lead to mortal
               ones!  Each  Daughter  of  Divine  Zeal  will  receive  Holy
               Communion without having any sin, after purifying herself in
               the sacrament of reconciliation. She will also delete the daily
               defects,  which  are  rather  involuntary  owing  to  human
               weakness, by pleading guilty, repenting lovingly, and pledging
               to  amend.  She  will  approach  the  angels'  table  with  a  pure
               heart, deepest]]></page><page Index="376"><![CDATA[humility, ardent love, and a living faith, seeing Jesus, who is
               going to her full of love, through the eyes of the spirit. She will
               approach  the  sacred  table  with  loving  trust  and  burning
               longing  in  order  to  receive  her  supreme  goodness,  her  life,
               her divine lover, her beloved, the breath of her soul. She will
               be  hungry  and  thirsty  for  Jesus.  Her  natural  affections,
               feelings,  faculties,  and  sensibility  must  be  transformed
               through  this  spiritual  intelligence,  this  hunger,  and  thirst  for
               Jesus! (5)


               b) Aridity

                    Due  to  complete  aridity  and  languidness,  a  person
               sometimes  happens  to  be  unable  to  form  even  a  sensible
               feeling  or  desire  for  Jesus.  Whatever  it  may  be,  she  must
               meet  everything.  As  much  as  possible,  the  intellect  must
               know  who  is  going  to  be  received  and  the  dispositions
               required for such a reception. The intellect is the will's owner.
               In other terms, we are the masters of our will because we can
               perform the acts of will through our free will. Despite aridity of   376
               feelings and lack of sensible devotion, the person who wants
               to receive a profitable Communion is able to produce acts of
               love, contrition, humility, living faith, desire, hunger and thirst
               for Jesus, and such a disposition is by no means less meri-
               torious  for  us  or  less  pleasing  to  God  than  the  acts  of  the
               sensible devotion. Repeating every day the acts of pure will in
               the preparation for the Communion also deserves from divine
               goodness the loving fire of sensible devotion as well as holy,
               loving thirst for Jesus. It can be said with the prophet David: «
               My soul is thirsting for you, my flesh is longing for you » (Ps.
               63, 1-2).

                    Till now we have considered the state of aridity in itself;
               now,  we  are  going  to  consider  it  in  its  connection  with
               ourselves,  specifically  as  an  effect  of  our  sins  as]]></page><page Index="377"><![CDATA[well as a punishment we deserve. Our lapses and relapses,
               insincere  confession  without  humility  and  resolve,  behavior
               diverging from religious perfection, disregard and indifference
               in prayer, and so many failures and malice are the cause of
               our aridity. This is the why Jesus withdraws from us. Aridity
               remains even after a person has received Jesus in the Holy
               Communion. She needs to examine herself in her innermost,
               to  plead  guilty  before  God,  humiliate  herself,  confess,  and
               amend her life, striving to observe the rules perfectly and to
               achieve the religious virtues.

                    Whatever may be the cause of aridity, the Daughter of
               Divine  Zeal  will  strive  to  make  acts  of  love,  desire,  humility
               and the like when she receives Holy Communion.

                    Through  prayer  we  may  win  everything.  O  soul,  if  you
               really  want  to  receive  Holy  Communion  with  great  fervor,
               feeling, and understanding of the great mystery of Jesus' love
               toward you, but you feel arid and unable to anything, pray to
               Jesus  who  will  have  mercy,  will  forgive,  and  will  grant  you
               love, humility, faith, desire, hunger, and thirst for himself.   377


               c) Remote preparation (6)

                    The preparation far the Holy Communion is remote and
               immediate.  Remote  preparation  consists  in  a  religious
               irreproachable  life.  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  who  receive
               Holy Communion frequently, please strive to be acceptable to
               the  divine  spouse  Jesus  so  that  he  may  rest  and  find
               pleasure  in  your  heart  when  you  receive  him  in  the  holy
               Eucharistic  Communion.  You  will  reach  it  by  perfectly
               practicing the virtues, aiming at being prepared for the time
               you  receive  Jesus  supreme  goodness  in  the  innermost  of
               your  soul.  You  will  direct  the  daily  acts  of  virtue,  patience,
               work, mortification, prayer, spiritual reading]]></page><page Index="378"><![CDATA[silence,  and  everything  toward  the  accomplishment  of  this
               goal. By doing so you always remember that you will receive
               Communion the following day.

                    If  during  the  day  you  now  and  then  invite,  desire,  and
               sigh for Jesus in the Sacrament through ejaculatory prayers
               and spiritual communions, you please Jesus very much and
               help  yourself.  What's  next?  Knowing  that  the  following  day
               you  will  receive  Jesus,  as  a  faithful  spouse  you  remember
               him even in the night, at least spiritually, intending to sigh for
               him at each breath, to receive him at each beat of heart while
               sleeping. You will put this intention in the night prayer, before
               going  to  sleep.  So,  you  will  fall  asleep  thinking  of  the  holy
               tabernacle  and  longing  to  receive  Jesus.  By  doing  so,  you
               can say: « I am sleeping, but my heart is vigilant. »

                    If you happen to awake in the night, before falling asleep
               again  think  a  moment,  desire,  crave  for  the  supreme
               goodness  in  the  Sacrament,  that  is  looking  and  waiting  to
               enter your heart.
                                                                         378
                    But to crown your remote preparation, you will profit by a
               more precious time the following day, when you have Jesus
               in your heart. While giving thanks to Jesus after Communion,
               you  can  make  the  best  preparation  for  the  following
               Communion.  Like  two  people  who  love  each  other  very
               tenderly,  after  staying  together  in  loving  conversation  and
               expressions of love, before parting they make an appointment
               to see each other again as soon as possible. Jesus and you
               will do the same in Communion. Jesus will ask you to receive
               him  the  following  day,  and  you,  full  of  his  love  In  spite  of
               knowing  that  you  are  unworthy  to  accept  such  a  lovely
               invitation,  will  ask  him  that  he  himself  admit  you  to  the
               Eucharistic  mystical  table  and  prepare  you  to  so  great  a
               fortune. You will]]></page><page Index="379"><![CDATA[also  offer  the  actual  Communion  as  the  best  remote
               preparation for tomorrow's Communion.


               d) Immediate preparation

                    If  we  are  as  fervent  as  we  are  careful  in  making  our
               remote preparation, we will also act likewise in the immediate
               one. A person, who has an appointment with the king, thinks
               of how to dress, how to behave, which words to say, the court
               formality which she must comply with. But, when she is in the
               tabby expecting to be introduced to the presence of the king,
               then  she  concentrates  her  thoughts.  Having  a  palpitation of
               reverential fear, she gathers in her mind everything she has
               planned: how to introduce herself, how to revere, how to talk.

                    Will  you  be  indifferent  and  thoughtless  when  you  are
               about to receive in your heart the divine lover, your adorable
               Jesus, your king of love, the sovereign creator of heaven and
               earth,  before  whom  the  powers  of  heaven  tremble,  who  is
               waiting  and  longing  for  you  with  sweetness,  love,  and   379
               gentleness? God forbid! Daughter of Divine Zeal, when you
               enter  the  church  to  attend  the  great  sacrifice  of  the  mass,
               when you are before the tabernacle you must consider that
               Jesus is there waiting for you - he has been waiting for you
               for 20 centuries -that his divine Heart is longing to enter your
               heart through the Communion you are going to receive. Think
               of  him  in  the  tabernacle,  staying  in  that  prison  of  love  as
               waiting for you only, yearning that you will free him by taking
               him  in  your  heart  enlarged  by  generous  love.  Please  make
               your immediate preparation with these loving thoughts.


               e) Thanksgiving (7)

                    The Daughters of Divine Zeal are obliged by rule to give
               a combination of thanksgiving after the Communion.]]></page><page Index="380"><![CDATA[Practically, such thanks are going to be prolonged till the next
               Communion,  succeeding  each  other  in  the  following  way,
               according to our institute's custom and rule:

                    1.  We  start  speaking  of  the  immediate  thanksgiving,
               which  is  the  most  important,  beneficial,  indispensable,  and
               dutiful.

                    As soon as the sister has received her divine lover Jesus
               supreme  goodness,  she  will  deeply  understand  that  God  of
               heaven and earth, the omnipotent Jesus, the lover of souls is
               living in her innermost being. Through the eyes of faith she
               will see Jesus the way in which her devotion will let her to see
               him,  such  as  watching  and  smiling,  seeking  love,  offering
               grace, working in her soul to correct and purify her. Through
               the ears of the soul she will listen to him who is saying lovely
               words, teaching, admonishing sweetly, exhorting to amend as
               well as to improve in his love, observance, humility, and elect
               virtues.

                    What will you do in those fortunate moments, Daughter   380
               of Divine Zeal? You will annihilate yourself in the presence of
               your beloved, sinking in love. Everything will disappear from
               your  mind,  but  Jesus.  Both  church  and  sisters  will  be  as
               non-existent, because Jesus will form a temple in your heart,
               where the angels and the saints will adore, exalt, and bless
               him for the great mercy he granted to you. If devotion allows,
               you may see in the shrine of your soul your sweetest Virgin
               Mary  as  mother  of  mercy  who  is  hugging,  thanking,  and
               praying to beloved Jesus for you.

                    What will you do in those fortunate moments? You will
               offer, surrender yourself to Jesus, mourn over your sins and
               past  life  perhaps  untidy,  weep  loving  tears  for  your  daily
               imperfections  and  perhaps  hidden  malice.  You  will  sink  in
               thanksgiving and protestations of love, asking]]></page><page Index="381"><![CDATA[fervently to love him as much as he deserves or as much as
               the saints have loved him or as much as the saints and the
               angels  love  him  in  heaven.  You  will  pray  to  the  sweetest
               mother of mercy to join you to her love for Jesus. Together
               with her you will ask Jesus to grant you the virtues necessary
               to  please  him  in  full.  Furthermore,  you  will  implore  with  the
               greatest  fervor  and  interest  the  zeal  for  his  glory  and  the
               salvation of souls as well as an increasing spirit of the prayer
               to  win  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church.  You  will  be
               recollected  in  yourself  till  the  end  of  the  mass,  unless
               obedience, customs, and rules oblige you to say local prayers
               together with the sisters.

                    What  we  have  said  now  concerns  the  first,  mast
               important  thanksgiving  for  the  Communion.  The  sister  who
               practices it carefully will be happy, but miserable will be the
               one who neglects it! If you have approached the sacred table
               with  relaxed,  upset,  unrecollected  conscience,  holding  a
               grudge  against  someone,  being  indocile,  proud,  full  of
               attachment  and  impatience,  dirty  with  faults,  riotous  at  the   381
               admonishments,  unworthy,  and  having  nearly  mortal  sins,
               what  expressions  of  love  can  you  have  with  your  beloved
               Jesus? He will come displeased to you, and you will become
               more  and  more  blind.  Oh,  daughter,  beware  of  such  a
               dangerous  state!  Please  be  converted  to  Jesus.  Humiliate
               yourself,  pray,  beg  forgiveness  for  your  bad  examples.
               Confess with all contrition, then go to your mother superior,
               hear  her  admonitions  and  exhortations,  and  at  last  receive
               Communion!  How  pleased  Jesus  will  be!  How  he  will
               embrace you! And you will be faithful to him!

                    2. Let us talk of the second thanksgiving. It will be made
               soon after the mass and the prayer in common to the most
               holy crucifix to win the plenary indulgence]]></page><page Index="382"><![CDATA[for purgatory's souls. This prayer will be never neglected.

                    You will always make the first thanksgiving mentally, but
               the second one may be done mentally or by reading a booklet
               or by both in perfect silence, lasting about 15 minutes. In the
               solemnities  it  lasts  longer.  You  will  repeat  the  acts  of  love,
               humility,  repentance,  offering,  and  prayer  according  to  the
               transport of your devotion.

                    3.  The  sisters  will  make  the  third  thanksgiving  in
               common. A reader will read it, and the others will follow it by
               mind, recollected and contrite. Usually they will use the one
               which  begins  with:  «  Exalt  my  heart  », etc.,  but  the  mother
               superior  may  sometimes  replace  it  with  others  that  are
               expressive and moving.

                    4.  The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  will  make  the  fourth
               thanksgiving,  which  must  be  habitual  during  the  day,  by
               offering  their  actions,  the  religious  practices,  the  work,
               suffering and mortification to the adorable Heart of Jesus as a
               continuous  thanksgiving  for  the  immense  grace  of  having   382
               received Jesus along with graces and mercies in their heart.
               Through  this  intention,  each  sister  will  make  the  fourth
               thanksgiving virtually and fruitfully, even  though she may be
               unaware of it during the day.

                    Who knows haw much Jesus is pleased and how many
               graces he gives to the sister who during the day renews over
               and  over  again  the  intention  of  a  continuous  thanksgiving!
               Jesus  will  be  always  present,  acting  in  her  heart  with  his
               grace  and  love.  But  if  the  sister  cannot  reach  so  much
               because  of  human  weakness,  Jesus  will  be  somehow
               pleased by her good intention and effort.

                    5.  A  fifth  thanksgiving  will  be  announced  after  the
               evening  prayers.  Recollected,  each  one  will  thank  the
               beloved Jesus fervently for the Communion of that day,]]></page><page Index="383"><![CDATA[will  repent  for  having  thanked  Jesus  unworthily,  and  will
               remind herself of the following day's Communion.

               f) Most important consideration

                    In the most holy name of Jesus I urge the present and
               future  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  to  consider  that  the
               improvement in the Lord of their humble institute along with
               its  aims  depends  on  receiving  frequently  the  Eucharistic
               Communion  with  the  dispositions,  preparations,  and
               thanksgivings we have expounded above.

                    The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  must  be  convinced  that
               union  of  love  with  Jesus  in  the  Communion  gives  life,
               existence,  growth,  fecundity,  and  firmness  to  a  religious
               institute.  Mutual  union  with  Jesus  founds  the  institute  on  a
               firm rock, which hellish powers are unable to throw down nor
               to  impair  its  beneficial  results  in  the  holy  Church.  A
               community which joins itself to the celestial spouse through
               the  Eucharistic  bonds  of  holy  love  delights  the  divine  Heart
               that  will  pledge  his  power  and  benevolence  to  protect  and   383
               improve  this  community  through  divine,  spiritual,  and
               temporal providence.

                    On the contrary, when a community slackens the remote
               and  the  immediate  preparation  for  the  frequent  Holy
               Communion as well as the adequate thanksgiving, quite the
               reverse will happen. Jesus is displeased by the indifference
               of the consecrated people who receive him every day while
               their hearts are attached to their own ego, while they are full
               of  selfishness,  perhaps  dirty  with  serious  faults,  envy,  and
               grudges. In such a case what are the consequences we have
               to face? God withdraws his mercies and reduces his graces,
               and yet he arouses remorses, impulses, and opportunities for
               conversion.  The  soul  that  mixes  sins  with  Communions
               becomes  insensible  quickly;  hence  lukewarmness  grows,
               transgressions]]></page><page Index="384"><![CDATA[multiply,  disease  expands  making  the  whole  community,  or
               most of it, swerve from the divine spouse. On the other hand,
               the  divine  spouse  too,  withdraws  from  the  community.  The
               observance of the vows of obedience, poverty, and chastity
               are  relaxed;  both  spiritual  and  material  buildings  collapse;
               prosperity and providence diminish owing to the lack of divine
               blessings.  It  is  not  a  surprise  if  even  daily  bread  fails,
               because the bread of eternal life is being trampled on.

                    I heartily recommend that the mother superiors be most
               watchful,  that  the  sisters  receive  Holy  Communion  with  the
               dispositions,  devotion,  and  recollection  we  have  described
               above, and make the thanksgivings as well.

               g) Signs of slackening

                    The  mother  superiors  have  to  pay  attention  to  the
               external signs which reveal the soul's slackening in the good
               disposition  for  receiving  the  Eucharistic  Communion.  They
               are: becoming lax in the remote preparation, such as lack of
               obedience,  of  silence,  and  of  mutual  charity  as  well  as   384
               attachment to one's own will and opinion, etc. A close sign is
               the  manifest  indifference  in  approaching  the  sacred  table,
               even  though  the  people  may  happen  to  observe  external
               behavior for human respect, concealing this way the internal
               indisposition.  Slackening  is  both  cause  and  effect  of  the
               Communions  received  without  good  disposition.  Especially
               the  person  who  receives  Communion  after  doing  wrong  by
               consent  and  deliberation  will  easily  lapse  into  anger  or
               impatience with her sisters. She has lost meekness.

                    The mother superior will ward off so great a disaster by
               calling  the  sister  to  order  quickly  and  gently,  charitably  and
               firmly, by making her consider the risk of losing her vocation
               and becoming lost as well! In such a case, a]]></page><page Index="385"><![CDATA[good  retreat  is  a  good  remedy.  The  mother  superior  must
               keep in mind that a sister who does not amend in time, may
               be  contagious.  The  souls'  enemy  may  cause  the  same
               situation  to  other  Religious,  and  disaster  will  be  complete
               (S.D.D.Z.).



                                        NOTES

                    (1)  « Each priest will say the canonical hours with great devotion,
               not by routine. Recollected and contrite in the divine presence, he will
               meditate  on  the  Holy  Spirit's  and  the  Church's divine  words, praying
               for the Christian people* (C.R.).
                    (2)  Remember  that  our  padre  was  writing   to   Religious   who
               entered the order when they were already priests.
                    (3)  Obviously,   this   limitation   was   valid   for   that   time.   The
               priests were only three and our padre  had  at  heart their  offering the
               holy mass for the institute's particular intentions.
                    (4)  For the new priests:   «What does  it  mean  celebrating  the
               mass  the  first  time?   It  signifies  that  a   most  holy  aim   has  been
               reached  as well  as  that  a   most  sublime,  divine   action   has   been
               accomplished  on earth!  Each  person,  however,   has a  different  un-  385
               derstanding.  The candidate  who  aspires    to    the    priesthood with    no
               pure  intention and  recollection,  but who was somehow forced and had
               an   imperfect   preparation,   lacks   this   alive   feeling.   On   the
               contrary, the one called kike Aaron to the most high ministry, having a
               heart  full  of  ardent  love,  innocence,  and  virtue,  as  well  as  a  mind
               enlightened  with  the  science  of  prayer  and  with    knowledge  of  the
               ecclesiastical  disciplines,  this  candidate  desires  to  feel  the  innermost
               relationship with God <in the celebration of his first mass, and longs to
               continue the redemptive action in the world as though he were to be a
               new Christ on earth » (For Mons. D'Arrigo's golden priestly jubilee, Sept.
               21, 1922)!
                    (5)    Through  the  decree  «Sacred  Synod  of  Trent*  Pius  X
               established the conditions to receive frequent or daily Communion. The
               state  of  grace  and  pure  intention  are  the  conditions.  Pure  intention  «
               consists in aiming at pleasing God by receiving Communion, joining Him
               more]]></page><page Index="386"><![CDATA[fervently  In  charity  and  profiting  by  that  divine  medicine  against
               one's own defects and imperfections.» In a preparation prayer on June
               28,  1922,  our  padre  gives  prominence  to  the  pure  intention,  which  is
               indispensable  for  daily  Holy  Communion.  He  writes:  «I  declare  that  I
               receive  this Holy  Communion  to  please you,  because I know you  like
               coming into my heart, not because other people do it nor by routine. I am
               going to receive this Holy Communion to correct my defects along with
               my bad inclinations, because you, in the Holy Sacrament, are remedy
               and health for faulty souls. Since I am frail, I mean to receive you as the
               divine  strength  of  my  soul.  Being  united  with  you,  may  I  get
               enlightenment,  strength,  and  help  in  order  to  reach  holy  virtues.  I  am
               going  to  receive  this  Holy  Communion  to  become  humble,  obedient,
               meek, sincere, and fervent. Since I do not know how to love you, I mean
               to  receive  this  Holy  Communion  in  order  that  your  Eucharistic  Heart,
               which in the most Holy Sacrament is like the fire of love burning the soul,
               share your fire of love with me. My beloved Jesus, please come in my
               heart. I expect, sigh, long for you, please do not be late. Even though I
               am so fortunate as to receive Holy Communion every day, still I receive
               today's  Communion  with  as  much  fervor  and  love  as  it  were  my  first
               Communion or the last one or the viaticum, and then I should present
               myself before your tribunal for judgment.»
                   (6)  We call the attention on our padre's  teaching. He desires that
               the  assiduous  care  for  our  individual  sanctification  be  the  remote
               preparation  for  the  most  Holy  Communion  according  to  the  Church's   386
               teaching.  This  page  seems  an  advanced  comment  on  the  following
               declarations  and  exhortations  of   Pius  XII.   The  pope   teaches  that
               <  an  abundant    rain  of  grace  will  come  from  mass  and    Holy  Com-
               munion,  if  we  love  the  everlasting    goods  instead    of  the    perishable
               ones  as  well  as  if  we  bridle  our  mortal  body  with  voluntary  mor-
               titifications    by   imposing   what   is   unpleasant   and    hard   to   it»
               (Mystical Body); furthermore, the pope states that the person willing to
               share the mysteries of Jesus has to  root out from  the senses wordiy
               allurements      and    vices...   thus,      the    ascetic    effort    aiming      at
               purifying  the  spirit   urges  and   disposes  the   faithful's  energies  to
               share   in  the  altar's  sacrifice  with   better  dispositions  and   better
               results...   Hence,   they   come   out   more   enlivened   and   disposed
               to prayer  and   Christian   mortification»   (God's   Mediator).
                   (7)  Be not surprised by our padres's insistence on the thanksgiving
               for the  most  Holy Communion. Among  the  dispositons  required   in
               order   to   receive   more   abundant   fruits   from   the   most Holy

                                THE DIVINE COMMAND

                   I  declare  that  I  deeply  understand  our  Lord  Jesus
               Christ's divine words which form this humble Institute's
               distinctive  character.  The  words  that  our  Lord  Jesus
               Christ said more than once when he saw the crowds in
               Judea abandoned like flock without a shepherd: « There
               is a large harvest, but few workers to gather it in. Pray to
               the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to
               gather  in  his  harvest.  »  I  will  consider  these  words  as
               addressed  to  this  plows  institute's  congregants  In  a
               particular  way  and  as  though  the  congregants  had
               received them from Jesus Christ's adorable lips. In this
               spirit,  I  consider  myself  fortunate,  because  I  have  been
               called  to  cultivate  this  divine  word,  to  which  I  mean  to
               commit my life. I will often consider the appropriateness
               of this mission and the vow of obedience to this divine
               command,  to  which  the  institute's  members  are
               committed.                                                389

                   The Church is the great harvest of the people all over
               the  world  of  any  class  and  condition.  I  will  always
               consider that most of the harvest In the infidels' lands, in
               the countries separated from the Catholic Church, in so
               many Catholic cities and countryside perishes for lack of
               workers  I  will  feel  my  heart  broken  by  so  great  a  ruin
               which  knocks  down  the  tender  harvest  of  the  new
               generations,  and  will  share  in  the  most  holy  Heart  of
               Jesus'  intimate  pains  for  such  a  great,  continuous,
               secular  ruin.  Remembering  the  divine  words:  «  Pray,
               therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the harvest  that  he  will  send
               out workers to gather in his harvest », I will hold that no
               remedy is more efficacious than this one commanded by
               our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  to  save  the  people,  the  nations,
               society,  the  Church,  especially  children  and  youth  as
               well as to evangelize the poor and to get all spiritual and
               temporal goods for humankind. Such a command urges
               us to entreat the]]></page><page Index="390"><![CDATA[most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  his  most  holy  mother,  the
               angels  and  the  saints  so  that  the  Holy  Spirit  raise
               powerful  vocations,  most  elect  souls,  zealous  and
               charitable  priests  for  the  salvation  of  souls,  and  God,
               himself,  create  the  most  elect  apostles  and  very  holy
               souls in all human classes. I will hold that the efforts of
               the holy Church's prelates and of the people responsible
               for forming holy priests is of no avail, unless God himself
               forms  the  priests.  This  does  not  happen,  unless  we
               resort  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  sovereign  remedy,
               obeying  faithfully,  zealously,  and  enthusiastically  the
               divine  command:  «  Pray,  therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the
               harvest  that  he  will  send  out  workers  to  gather  in  his
               harvest ».
                    I will dedicate my life and my intentions to the prayer
               of the « Evangelical Rogation of the most holy Heart of
               Jesus, »  paying careful attention and zeal to it. Following
               our constitutions I will care that our Lord Jesus Christ's
               command, so far underestimated, be known and obeyed
               everywhere.  Specifically,  I  will  strive  so  that  the  two
               clergies, the holy Church's prelates, the pious souls, the   390
               virgins consecrated to Jesus, the seminarians, the poor,
               and  the  children  pray  to  God  that  he  will  send  out
               Innumerable perfect workers in the priesthood and laity
               for the sanctification and salvation of all the peoples. To
               make this «rogation» universal, with the Lord's help I will
               be ready to meet any sacrifice, even to give up my life.


                             1. CARVING IT IN THE HEART

                    The  Little  Poor  of  Jesus'  Heart  must  keep  the  divine
               Savior's  word  in  her  heart,  carve  it  there,  and  feel  his
               supreme  interest  deeply. Like  the  loving  mystical  dove,  she
               will wail in the presence of God to win from divine mercy holy
               vocations to the priesthood and will pray for the sanctification
               of  the  priests. To  keep  this prayer  alive  and  to  qualify their
               mission, the Little Poor of Jesus' Heart will put on their chest
               a badge in the shape of Jesus' Heart with the words: Pray,
               therefore, etc. This motto]]></page><page Index="391"><![CDATA[forms their humble institute's emblem and specifies the zeal
               to which they are committed for God's glory and the salvation
               of souls (C.P.).

                    Beginning  with  the  double  proclamation  of  the  divine
               superiors,  the  Rogationist  of  Jesus'  Heart  wilt  love  and
               respect more his institute's sacred emblem: Pray, therefore,
               etc. He will imagine the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, the divine
               superior  in  the  tabernacle,  who  afflicted  for  lack  of  priests
               shows St. Luke and St. Matthew's verses (Lk. X, 2 - Mt. IX,
               37)  as  well  as  the  souls  abandoned  like  a  flock  without  a
               shepherd. He invites him to look at the harvest of souls, the
               people, and the works that are getting lost for lack of workers,
               and says: « Here is the rule that I and my most holy mother,
               your  sweet,  benign,  lowing  superiors  give  you.  Do  not  get
               tired of praying in my name to the owner of the harvest (me,
               the  Father,  and  my  most  holy  mother)  to  quickly  send  out
               numerous, holy workers to the mystical harvest. You yourself
               strive to become a good worker for my glory and the salvation
               of souls in whatever mission I will appoint you (From the Little   391
               Rules of the Two Proclamations).

                    While praying for holy vocations, the Little Poor of Jesus'
               Heart will ask God to help many poor youths who are longing
               to  become  priests  and  to  grant  perseverance  to  those  who
               are answering God's call.

                    Clerics. The seminaries are the fields of our Lord Jesus
               Christ's Church, where the mystical plantations are cultivated.
               The tender buds  which will feed all the people on earth are
               the clerics. Oh, the beautiful hope of the coming harvest! The
               luxuriant generation of the mystical harvest's future workers!
               The clerics are the most beautiful, the dearest share of Jesus'
               Heart!  Beautiful  is  the  plantation  in  bloom,  when  the  fruits
               begin springing up. Then it is more beautiful and gentle than]]></page><page Index="392"><![CDATA[after its harvest. Likewise, the generation of the future priests
               smiles  beautifully  at  the  mystical  farmer's  eyes.  With  how
               much love, care, and jealousy the divine lover looks at them!
               They are the first fruits of his love, the future saviors of, the
               souls he redeemed by his Most Precious Blood! The fate of
               millions  and  millions  of  souls  is  bound  to  their  success!
               Therefore,  this  elect  generation,  this  hope  of  the  most  holy
               Heart  of  Jesus  will  be  the  most  cherished,  holy,  and  pure
               thought of Jesus Heart's Little Poor (C.P.).

                    It  is  necessary  to  bring  into  evidence  the  gratuitous,
               undeserved  predestination  of  God  to  form  the  pious
               foundation  of  the  two  institutes  that  are  dedicated  to  the
               adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  and  are  committed  to  his  divine
               command of the Evangelical Rogation. His command keeps
               the  secret  of  the  world's  and  of  society's  salvation,  were  it
               made an  institution. The  institution  comes  into  existence  by
               the vow of obedience to this command, by the rule binding its
               members to pray, by the emblem decorating the congregants'
               chest  and  by  the  expressive  names  of  the  two  orders:
               Rogationists  of  Jesus'  Heart  (from  the  Latin  word  Rogate)   392
               and Daughters of Divine Zeal; either order must follow Jesus'
               Heart's  divine  zeal,  from  which  the  divine  command  came
               forth!

                    Both  institutes  are  born  of,  in,  and  from  Rogate.  They
               have  almost  received  these  ardent  words  from  the  divine
               teacher's adorable lips, feel themselves intimately penetrated
               by  the  Rogate,  have  absorbed  it  as  the  hope  of  their
               existence  in  Jesus  and  in  his  longing  for  the  Father's  glory
               along with the salvation of the souls. These institutes are not
               satisfied  by  fulfilling  the  command  among  themselves,  nor
               following  only  the  prayer's  command  that  the  Lord  of  the
               harvest send out workers, but they also apply two additional
               meanings. The point of fact]]></page><page Index="393"><![CDATA[is that God's word may be applied limitlessly, and the more it
               is contemplated, the more it is esteemed.

                    What is the first binding meaning? It flows from the word
               «  workers.  »  Committed  to  each  word  of  this  mystical
               decalogue  (  it  is  made  of  ten  words:  «  Rogate  -  ergo  -
               dominum  -  messis  -  ut  -  mittat  -  operarios  -  in  -  messem
               -suam »  ), we should feel ashamed to ask God and the most
               holy  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary  for  good  workers  to  the
               mystical harvest of the souls, if we ourselves were not striving
               with all our soul, heart, mind, and body to be good workers
               with God's help, our good will, and pure intention. The divine
               words asking for workers to the immense harvest of the souls
               keep ourselves ready, miserable as we may be, to favor with
               God's help any charitable, beneficent work, either spiritual or
               temporal, whenever we may apply our efforts to it.

                    The  second  meaning  flows  from  the  word  ergo.  If  we
               meditate on the small word  « ergo », which means therefore,
               the  prayer's  validity  and  efficacy  gain  value.  The  adverb  «
               therefore »  summarizes  the  precedent  reasons,  proofs, and   393
               reasonableness  as  well  as  the  application  that  the  people
               make to the subject.

                    To  understand  the  therefore's  importance  when  it  is
               related  to  the  prayer's  efficacy  to  win  numerous  and  elect
               priests  to  the  holy  Church,  we  report  the  reasons  why  the
               divine teacher, thirsty for souls, commanded many times his
               prayer  of  his  divine  zealous  Heart  to  the  apostles,  to  the
               disciples, and to all the followers.

                    This  therefore  binds,  urges,  almost  compels  us  to
               answer  directly  the  command  to  win  holy  vocations  of  new
               priests, new ministers, a new creation of divine omnipotence
               and mercy, new angels of the divine priestly ministry through
               insistent,  humble,  and  trustful  prayers.  Desirous  of  nothing
               else but divine glory and salvation]]></page><page Index="394"><![CDATA[of souls, may these ministers share in the divine thirst of our
               Lord  Jesus  Christ,  who  longed  and  longs  for  the  eternal
               salvation of all. May they grow in the most elect virtues and in
               the  beneficial  ecclesiastical  science,  which  inclines  them  to
               the  perfect  practice  of  the  holy  ministry.  As  new  apostles,
               may they hurl themselves in the midst of the souls that Jesus
               Christ redeemed with his Most Precious Blood in order to win
               them  to  the  virtue,  grace,  and  eternal  life  through
               ecclesiastical law, fervor, faith, and charity!

                    Oh,  how  happy  are  those  who  understand  the  divine
               command:  Pray,  therefore...  (From  various  records  of  our
               padre).



                             2. THE GREAT REVELATION

                    The evangelists St. Luke and St. Matthew registered our
               Lord Jesus Christ's great word.
                                                                         394
                    St. Matthew says: As he saw the crowds, his heart was
               filled  with  pity  for  them,  because  they  were  worried  and
               helpless,  like  sheep  without  a  shepherd.  So  he  said  to  his
               disciples,  «  There  is  a  large  harvest,  but  few  workers  to
               gather it in. Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send
               out workers to gather in his harvest » (Mt. 9, 36-38).

                    St.  Luke  (10,  2):  he  said  to  them,  «  There  is  a  large
               harvest, but few workers to gather it In. Pray to the owner of
               the  harvest  that  he  will  send  out  workers  to  gather  in  his
               harvest. »

                    The meaning of these words in obvious. Harvest means
               the people; workers means the priests as well as those who
               are in charge with saving the people entrusted to them: the
               people  are  many,  but  God's  ministers  few,  therefore  Jesus
               said: Pray to the owner of the harvest,]]></page><page Index="395"><![CDATA[that  is  to  say,  pray  to  God  that  he  will  send  out  numerous
               priests to his Church for the salvation of all.

                    Rogate  -  it  means  pray  -  implies  both  exhortation  and
               command, and each Christian is obliged to obey it; hence all
               of us have to pray to reach this goal, because Jesus Christ
               wants it.

                    These  passages  from  the  holy  Gospel  make  a  great
               revelation:

                    1. First, they manifest the desire of the most holy Heart
               of Jesus, who was to create the true, eternal priesthood on
               earth in order to perform the divine cult, to offer forever the
               victim  of  infinite  value,  and  to  continue  on  earth  his  divine
               ministry of eternal salvation for souls. Thirsty for souls as he
               was, Jesus could not help letting burst forth this great word,
               this divine command. To quote a biblical phrase we say that
               his  zeal  was  devouring  his  divine  Heart  far  his  greatest
               interest.
                                                                         395
                    2.  Second,  through  those  symbolical  words  Jesus
               represented  the  holy  Church,  the  whole  world,  and  each
               social organization as a harvest which should be cultivated by
               good workers to fill the mystical barns with copious craps. If
               the harvest is neglected, it perishes miserably.

                    3.  Third,  through  these  words  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ
               pointed out that his priests are the means of salvation for the
               mystical  harvest  of  souls;  no  doubt  that  obedience  to  this
               divine command is the secret key that saves the Church and
               society. Such a prayer is the holy Church's greatest means to
               expand  the  kingdom  of  God and  to  reach  all  goods  in time
               and eternity. (1)

                    4. Fourth, our Lord wants us to understand that to obtain
               this priceless good we have to pray to the owner]]></page><page Index="396"><![CDATA[of the harvest, who is God, who is himself. He taught us that
               his priests do not come by chance, nor are self-formed, nor
               are  formed  by  human  effort.  They  come  from  divine  mercy
               that creates, begets, and gives them to the world. He teaches
               us that we do not get them, unless we pray! Isn't it obvious? It
               is God that sends forth the saints on earth. Isn't it a greatest
               mercy of his? How can we pretend to have it without asking
               for  it?  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  command  is  very  clear:  «
               There is a large harvest, but few workers to gather it in. Pray,
               therefore,  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that he  will  send  out
               workers to gather in his harvest. » (2)

                    In reference to the holy Catholic Church and society, this
               divine  word  refers  to  all  goods  and  salvation  in  time  and
               eternity.  And  yet,  for  about  20  centuries  this  great  word,
               which is our Lord Jesus Christ's definite, repeated command,
               has remained almost buried or quite unknown in the gospel,
               in spite of keeping a great secret of salvation for the Church
               and  society.  Oh,  God's  inexplicable  mysteries!  Although  it
               was  so  clear,  God  kept  it  secret  perhaps to  reveal  it  in  our
               times when religion is depopulated, and when the cities and   396
               the  peoples  are  lacking  the  greatest  means  of  salvation
               (Preface, Precious Adhesions, 1921).



                               3. BUT FEW WORKERS...

                    Jesus makes us hear his painful wail: « There is a large
               harvest,  but  few  workers  to  gather  it  in.  »  When  our  Lord
               Jesus Christ said these words, he was looking through all the
               centuries at the cities, the peoples, the regions of the world till
               the  end  of  time,  and  lamented  over  the  lack  of  evangelical
               workers, which at times is worse than other times.]]></page><page Index="397"><![CDATA[If we look at our pitiable times, we cannot help sharing in
               the adorable Jesus' Heart's pains for the great lack of people
               dedicated  to  the  mystical  harvest.  The  Church  is
               impoverished, the souls perish, and the desolation foreseen
               by  Daniel  is  expanding  under  the  eyes  of  the  shepherds  of
               the Church. All of them experience the lack of priests in the
               dioceses, cities, and countrysides.

                    A  bishop  wrote  to  me  that  42  country  parishes  of  his
               diocese have no priest. Other bishops complain too, some of
               them  more,  some  less.  What  about  the  people?  My  God,
               what  an  abyss  of  misery!  And  yet,  the  regions  lacking
               ministers  perhaps  have  innocent  children  who  would  feel
               drawn  to  ecclesiastical  vocation,  if  they  were  cultivated  in
               piety and the love of God.

                    The  lack  of  financial  means  sometimes  prevents  the
               parents  from  encouraging  their  children  to  enter  the  ec-
               clesiastical status; in this case, the seed of piety instilled by
               the Lord fails to grow, because the children are not cultivated,
               or are hired for a quick profit, or the families are indifferent. In   397
               short, many are the reasons why so many youths remain in
               the world to the prejudice of their soul and the souls of others,
               while they might have become holy priests.

                    Meanwhile,  who  saves  the  new  generations?  Who
               breaks the bread of God's word to the children who ask for it,
               but do not find any? Who teaches the poor youths so much
               betrayed everywhere? « Let the children come to me » (Mc.
               10,  14),  said  Jesus  Christ.  But,  who  lets  the  children  go  to
               Jesus?  Perhaps  the  philanthropic  societies?  Or  the  civil
               colleges? Or the protestants, who as richly hired emissaries
               plunged  in  everywhere  after  the  European  war  to  open
               kindergartens  -  my  God!  -  and  schools  and  colleges  and
               orphanages free of charge]]></page><page Index="398"><![CDATA[in  order  to  get  hold  of  children  and  dechristianize  them,
               teaching  that  Jesus  Christ  founded  no  Church,  or  that  the
               Church  is  invisible,  or  that  praying  to  the  most  holy  Mary
               offends Jesus Christ, or that using sacred images is against
               the commandments, or that the Eucharistic Sacrament is not
               Jesus Christ, or that confession has been fabricated by the
               priests, etc. etc.? My God, what a ruin for the souls!

                    Oh!  How  many  youths  go  astray  in  their  prime  of  life
               because no good evangelical worker receives them, showing
               the  way  of  piety  through  pious  unions,  associations,  good
               readings,  holy  industries,  and  true  zeal.  The  endangered
               honesty of common and civil young women perishes, for no
               minister  guides  them  to  the  sacraments  through  untiring
               preaching, hearing confessions, and teaching. No one helps
               or  shelters  the  poorest  among  them  through  resources  of
               charity. How many beggars are immersed in crass ignorance
               because no  priest  teaches  and relieves  them!  Who blesses
               and  legitimates  marriages?  Who  safeguard  the  virgins  who
               long  for  the  mystical  wedding,  joining  them  with  the  divine
               spouse?  Who  assists  the  dying  when  they  are  on  the   398
               threshold  of  eternity?  Oh,  how  many  sick  people  languish,
               dying  without  confession,  viaticum,  and  extreme  unction
               because no priest is available!

                    Impiety,  unbelief,  anarchy  of  any  holy  principle  in  faith
               and civilization make their way more and more into the world.
               Debauchery, bad press, sects, plots, revolutions, misery, and
               desperation are increasing.

                    If  we  look  at  the  infidels'  regions,  which  are  the  most
               extensive,  our  heart  bleeds  for  the  abandoned  souls  which
               are of as much value as ours, are redeemed by the adorable
               blood of our Lori Jesus Christ, and]]></page><page Index="399"><![CDATA[are  willing  to  meet  the  truth.  How  many  thousands  of
               not-,baptized  children  are  eaten  by  animals  or  are  thrown
               down by wild parents in a river or at the foot of a tree,  still
               gasping!  How  many  thousands  of  wild  people  grow
               brutalized,  dying  without  knowing  God  and  the  why  of  their
               existence.

                    All  this  happens  for  lack  of  workers  in  the  mystical
               harvest, for the missionaries are not enough for the needs of
               the infidel's regions.

                    In  short,  today  we  can  repeat  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's
               words: There is a large harvest, but few workers!



                                4. PRAY, THEREFORE

                    What is the remedy?

                    Our Lord pointed to a great, universal remedy by saying:   399
               « Pray, THEREFORE, to the owner of the harvest that he will
               send  out  workers  to  gather  in  his  harvest.  »  This  supreme,
               infallible  remedy  is  tied  to  prayer.  We  called  this  remedy
               infallible because our Lord cannot be mistaken. If he pointed
               to  prayer  as  to  a  remedy,  it  means  that  the  prayer  will  be
               heard, otherwise he would have not recommended it. It is as
               though he had said: if you ask me for workers for the souls'
               harvest, I will give them. But, it also means: if you do not ask
               me for them, you will not have as many good workers as you
               need. (3)

                    Several  things  Jesus  commanded  in  the  gospel;  ex-
               perience  from  centuries  teaches  that  everytime  the  people
               followed those divine commands, they reached what God has
               promised.  So,  the  Lord  will  bless  the  dioceses  and  the
               seminaries that pray for vocations, solving all their problems,
               and enabling the world to prepare]]></page><page Index="400"><![CDATA[itself  for  the  execution  of  the promise  of one  flock  and  one
               shepherd. (4)

                    Let  us  ask  the  God  of  mercy  and  of  holiness  for
               phalanxes of apostles. If we pray, he cannot help giving them,
               since he pledged his word. A radical remedy is at stake: let us
               apply ourselves to this holy radicalism.

                    When  God  punishes  a  people  with  the  greatest  pun-
               ishment,  he  deprives  it  of  good  priests.  This  is  the  worst
               misfortune  for  a  city.  The  greatest  divine  mercy  is  God's
               sending out good workers for the salvation of souls as he did
               when he sent on earth his only Son, whose representatives
               are the priests.

                    If both the prayer to win priests according to God and the
               works  to  propagate  this  prayer  were  coming  from  a  simple
               inspiration and from the natural consideration of its utility, all
               the people should preferably answer such an advertisement
               for  its  high  aim.  We  know  instead  that  Jesus  Christ himself
               commanded this universal prayer of the highest importance,   400
               and we find it remarkable that St. Luke reports Jesus Christ's
               divine  exhortation  by  using  the  verb  in  the  imperfect  tense,
               which  means  -  used  to  say,  -  pointing  out  how  insistently
               Jesus inculcated it.

                    We  also  remark  that  since  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ
               commanded  us  to  pray  for  good  priests,  the  labor  of  the
               bishops along with the seminaries' directors only reaches an
               artificial  culture  of  priests,  if  such  a  command  is  neglected.
               The Church will have half-priestly vocations for lack of grace,
               since  only  the  most  extensive  obedience  to  that  command
               through the most extensive, interested prayer to win priests
               according  to  God  may  gain  such  a  grace.  Oh!  Only  the
               Powerful who is able to rouse descendants to Abraham from
               the rocks, can raise such priests (Lk. 3, 8).]]></page><page Index="401"><![CDATA[5. THE POPES' CONCERN

                    Let  us  remember  the  work  of  the  last  popes  who
               concerned  themselves  with  this  spirit  of  prayer,  starting
               something  as  the  prelude  to  the  worldly  increase  of  obedi-
               ence to this divine command.

                    Under the pontificate of Pius X, the writer of these pages
               who has started three institutions with this divine prayer, gave
               an account of them to the head of the holy Church, who once
               said: « I want to champion this prayer. »

                    Later, through His Eminence Merry del Vail he replied to
               the  director  of  these  institutes,  and  expressed  his  pleasure
               because so many personalities of the ecclesiastical hierarchy
               had  taken  to  heart  this  command  of  Christ,  and  joined  his
               prayer to the prayer of so many members, with pleasure. (5)

                    When  I  submitted  a  humble  petition  to  His  Holiness
               Benedict  XV,  he  joined  the  universal  pious  union  of  the
               Evangelical Rogation of Jesus' Heart, and concerned himself   401
               with  this  command  by  saying  that  Jesus  gave  it
               authoritatively. He praised the institute's aim and on May 10,
               1921,  spontaneously  granted  a  plenary  indulgence  to  those
               who  would  pray  before  the  Holy  Sacrament  for  an  hour  in
               order  to  win  holy  vocations.  Furthermore,  considering  the
               great lack of missionaries for the infidels' conversion, all the
               popes desire, he published a beautiful prayer to win holy mis-
               sionaries  for  the  blooming  harvest  of  the  regions  of  the
               infidels,  giving  prominence  to  the  divine  command:  Rogate
               Ergo.

                    Almost  contemporaneously  and  under  the  auspices  of
               His Eminence Card. Vicar, a Pious Union committed to pray
               for  the  winning  of  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church  was
               formed in Rome.]]></page><page Index="402"><![CDATA[We cannot help enjoying the appearance of the first ray
               of the rising sun of this spirit of prayer or  universal rogation
               through the working of two popes. This rising from the high
               began  advancing  splendidly  and  shiningly  since  the  early
               days of Pius XI's pontificate when the Pious Union of prayer
               was presented to him, and he praised this prayer as the work
               of the works; which expression is worthy of consideration.

                    Inspired word: God spoke through his vicar!

                    Praying  for  holy  vocations  is  the  work  par  excellence
               because Jesus Christ commands it and because the Catholic
               priesthood will bloom in the holy Church by winning holy and
               powerful vocations from God. Since the Catholic priesthood is
               Jesus  Christ's  priesthood,  his  word  comes  true:  «  As  the
               Father sent me, so I send you »... and all good follows, being
               the priests the salt and the light of the world. The Church, the
               dioceses, and the history of the regions of the infidels show
               how  much  good  came  from  the  Catholic  priesthood.  Aren't
               the  priests  the  perpetuators  of  the  divine  redemption?  How
               many holy priests did we have in all times and how many holy   402
               institutions did they found!

                    When  the  prayer  commanded  by  Jesus  Christ  to  win
               priests to the Church is constituted and organized through an
               institution,  it  must  be  called  the  work  of  the  works.  Well
               understood,  this  expression  means:  «  a  work  dedicated  to
               this  aim  is  the  mother  of  many  good  works,  generator  of
               great, holy activities for the greatest glory of God, the greater
               salvation of souls, and the amplest fulfillment of the Church's
               divine  mission  in  the  world.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  this  is  the
               work that wins the elect of God, bringing about the saints in
               the Church. »

                    Pius XI arranged a yearly day of prayer in Rome (as well
               as in the dioceses all over the world), aiming at]]></page><page Index="403"><![CDATA[bending the divine clemency to eliminate the lack of priests -
               what a great punishment! - by enriching the holy Church with
               plenty of holy vocations.



                               6. NECESSARY PRAYER

                    The holy Church and the peoples all over the world need
               this  prayer  because  God  fixed  beforehand  that  the  priests
               guide human beings to the truth and salvation. (6) God also
               established  that  even  redemption  is  useless  without  the
               priests,  since  they  are  entrusted  with  continuing  it  and
               applying its fruits. For that reason Jesus said tee the priests:
               « You are the light of the world, you are the salt of the earth
               »;  but  there  is  no  light  without  the  lantern  shining  on  the
               lamp-stand; there is no way to preserve food from corruption
               without the salt keeping it.

                    Both! Church and society are in trouble. Jesus Christ's
               mystical  bride  cries  for  lack  of  evangelical  workers,  while   403
               society's ruin increases!

                    Wherever  good  appears,  faith  blooms,  the  souls  find
               salvation,  the  youth  grow  faithful,  the  poor  are  relieved,  the
               good  works  rise.  Wherever  religion  is  supported,  defended,
               and  protected,  error  is  defeated.  Wherever  the  laity  is
               Catholic and active, there you find the priest's work. It is the
               work of the bishops, of the holy Church's prelates, and of the
               clergies that operates all the good you find on earth; but all
               people  receive  light  and  splendor  from  the supreme  pontiff,
               who is the Church's sun receiving light from God directly. This
               great  ecclesiastical  hierarchy  is  made  of  elect  workers  who
               are  appointed  by  God  to  the  divine  ministry.  The  world
               receives life from its splendor.

               darkness? Where would you find God's cult, the sacraments,
               the  Eucharist,  God's  word,  faith,  and  charity?  All  of  them
               would end!

                    Now,  please  imagine  the  opposite.  Suppose  that  the
               earth  is,  full  of  God's  elect  ministers,  of  numerous,  holy
               priests: one for every hundred persons and all of them are as
               holy as. the ancient apostles. Wouldn't you think it would be
               he  sudden  salvation  and  happiness  of  all  souls,  no  one
               excepted?

                    Oh,  unfathomable  judgments  of  God!  The  Most  High
               conditioned plenty of good workers in the mystical harvest to
               the prayer to win them (News and Registration of the Sacred
               Allies Supporters).

                    Praying  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  is  also  necessary
               because the sending out of the workers to the harvest as well
               as the abundant gathering are of utility to all people, whose
               salvation  we  must  solicit  and  promote  mutually  through   404
               prayer.

                    Let us acknowledge, therefore, that innumerable goods
               for  the  holy  Church  and  the  peoples  may  come  from  the
               faithful obedience to this divine command as well as from the
               universal spreading of this universal Rogation.

                    Like efficacious grace, vocations come from high. If we
               neglect  the  command  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  to  pray,
               vocations will not come nor will we achieve the effects of so
               many  works  and  culture.  In  fact,  we  are  unable  to  infuse
               efficacious, fervent vocations; only the Church's unanimous,
               fervent prayer is able to do it. If based on prayer, the bishops'
               work  in  the  seminaries  may  become  immensely  useful  and
               efficacious;  the  same may  occur  in  the  religious  orders.  To
               conclude, we insist on saying that the remedy is prayer; by
               making no use]]></page><page Index="405"><![CDATA[of It, we slight it, and we will suffer the consequences from
               lack of good vocations.

                    How  is  it  that  priests  sometimes  abound,  while  their
               priestly  work  is  lacking?  And  yet,  the  work  of  priestly
               formation  in  the  Church  is  very  active.  Both  dioceses  and
               religious  orders  have  plenty  of  seminaries  for  youths  along
               with blooming novitiates. For that reason we make a point of
               Providence wanting action and prayer combined to produce
               their  effect.  Praying  to  the  Lord  that  he  will  send  out  good
               workers to the holy Church without working according to our
               duty and possibility to reach such a goal is a vain prayer, it is
               like a « noisy gong or a clanging bell » (I Cor. 13, 1). Vice
               versa, working for the priestly formation without praying is a
               useless work, « wasting its punches » (1 Cor. 9, 26). Aiming
               at  forming  priests  without  asking  them  from  the  Lord  is
               cultivating  priests  artificially.  True  vocation  comes  from  on
               high through prayer (Rules for the Sacred Allies Supporters).


                                                                         405
                       7. PRIESTHOOD IS FOUNTAIN OF MERITS

                    The  spreading  of  this  divine  prayer  brings  about  many
               particular graces to souls. Oh! How do they open their mind
               to understand the priesthood's importance!

                    A  great  benefit  is  the  understanding  of  the  merits  they
               may acquire. (7) St. Vincent de Paul thinks that no good work
               deserves so much as the formation of one priest for the holy
               Church. Whoever forms a priest for the Church shares in the
               spiritual maternity oaf the Church and in the good the priest
               will  operate  such  as  the  administration  of  the  sacraments,
               preaching, and the salvation of souls, profiting spiritually and]]></page><page Index="406"><![CDATA[temporally because God blesses him in everything. When the
               priest celebrates the daily sacrifice of the mass, the person
               who formed him (either alive or dead) will share the best of it.

                    To cheer ourselves in this spirit of prayer, we should look
               at  the  example  of  our  Lord,  the  most  holy  Virgin,  and  the
               saints.

                    Jesus  Christ  «  did  and  taught  »  (Act.  1,  1).  Before
               ordering  his  apostles  and  his  disciples  to  win  evangelical
               workers  through  prayer,  he  himself  prayed  for  it.  In  fact,
               before  calling  the  holy  apostles  he  prayed  all  night  on  a
               mountain (Lk. 6, 12). (8) Where did the Catholic apostolate of
               all  times  come  from?  Who  brought  about  the  apostles,  the
               confessors, the saints, and the untiring workers of all times?

                    « His mother treasured all these things in her heart » (Lk.
               2,51). Did Mary keep her divine son's words idle in her heart,
               as  the  lazy  servant  did  with  the  money?  Not  at  all.  She
               untiringly  did  what  her  son  commanded,  never  eating  the
               Eucharistic  bread  idly,  but  winning  the  altar's  ministers  with   406
               her prayer from then on.

                    We think that the apostles did the same. When the Holy
               Spirit reminded them what Jesus had said and commanded,
               how they obeyed zealously!

                    Also  Alapide  thinks  so  when  he  explains  the  above
               passages  from  St.  Matthew  and  St.  Luke.  In  fact,  before
               joining  the  new  apostle  Matthias  to  the  Sacred  College  by
               drawing lots, the apostles prayed (Act. 1, 24).

                    The  holy  Church  makes  us  repeat  in  the  apostles'
               preface the following beautiful, remarkable words: « It is truly
               worthy,  right,  convenient,  and  beneficial  that  we  pray
               insistently,  o  Lord  eternal  shepherd,  not  to  abandon  your
               flock. »]]></page><page Index="407"><![CDATA[8. PRIESTHOOD IS FOUNTAIN OF GOOD

                    Only the Catholic priesthood can spread the light of the
               truth  all  over  the  world.  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  said  to  the
               priests: « You are like salt for all mankind. But, if salt loses its
               taste,  there  is  no  way  to  make  it  salty  again...  You are  like
               light for the whole world » (Mt. 5, 13-14). It is as though he
               had said: how can the souls find salvation without ministers?

                    All complain about the pitiable situation of so many cities
               and nations. Well then, God made the  nations curable, and
               no  means  is  more  beneficial  than  plenty  of  evangelical
               workers.

                    What  institution  of  faith  and  charity  can  be  conceived
               without  the  Catholic  priesthood?  Aren't  the  priests  the  new
               Christ  sent  to  the  world  as  Jesus  himself  was  sent  by  the
               Father?...  Only  the  priesthood  is  able  both  to  destroy  the
               kingdom of sin and to change the face of the earth. Its power
               is unlike the worldly power; it is a divine force, a miraculous   407
               secret  attracting  hearts  and  making  the  contrary  powers,
               terrestrial  and  hellish,  impotent.  Nineteen  centuries  of
               Christianity show and strengthen this truth evidently. Without
               the priesthood's divine efficacy it is impossible to explain both
               the  supreme  prodigy  of  the  apostles,  who  regenerated
               humankind through the cross' foolishness, and the wonders
               that  the  apostolical  men  worked to  support the  Church and
               save  souls.  Also  the  Catholic  laity  is  a  fountain  of
               innumerable workers. But, how could the Catholic laity exist
               without the priesthood which creates it directly or indirectly?
               And  the  sacred  virgins,  who  commit  themselves  to  the
               spiritual and temporal beneficence of the neighbor, are also
               daughters of the Catholic priesthood.

                   The divine word is always a sublime synthesis which]]></page><page Index="408"><![CDATA[holds  innumerable  mysteries,  spreading  manifold  teachings
               to us.

                    The divine Rogate ergo must be considered not only in
               relation  to  the  priests  who  are  raised  by  the  supreme
               vocations obtained by the obedience to the divine command,
               but  also  in  relation  to  the  persons  that  God  raises  for  the
               good of his Church and for the souls.

                    As some persons sow and others harvest, some people
               water  the  blooming  seed  with  their  tears  and  others  come
               home happy with the reaped sheaves, some separate wheat
               from  straw  and  others  keep  it  in  the  barns  and  others
               distribute it, so several agents work for the eternal salvation
               oaf the souls in the social classes. (9)

                    The first agents are the princes of the nations, the kings,
               the  statesmen,  and  the  government  or  administration  high
               officers, who are abler to cooperate with the Church and the
               Catholic  priesthood  for  the  salvation  of  the  souls.  Oh,  how
               much  the  culture  of  the  souls'  mystical  harvest  depends  on   408
               those who are in power! The Catholic, pious rulers who are
               children of the holy Church, fearing, loving God, and humbly
               submitting  themselves  to  Jesus  Christ's  vicar,  are  the
               religion's right hand because they are able to do a very great
               good in the mystical field of the souls' harvest.

                    For that reason the holy Church wants the faithful to pray
               for  peace  and  agreement  among  the  Christian  princes,
               placing  suitable  prayers  in  the  liturgy;  therefore,  when  they
               want to carry out that great command of Jesus' Heart's divine
               zeal by praying to win good workers to the holy Church, they
               have  to  put  the  special  intention  to  win  rulers  according  to
               God's will.

                    Good workers of the mystical harvest are also the]]></page><page Index="409"><![CDATA[educators, because education implies the most holy Heart of
               Jesus' interests. Plenty of bad educators are the scourge, the
               hurricane, the storm, the tornado, which overthrows, upsets,
               and  engulfs  the  earth!  Bad  educators  are  the  atheistical  or
               miscreant  or  dishonest  teachers;  poor  the  pupils  who  have
               such teachers!

                    Obedience to the divine Rogate also implies the duty to
               ask the divine goodness for sending out teachers, educators,
               and  directors  of  the  institutes  who  are  believers,
               church-goers, and God-fearing. They can teach the mind and
               educate the heart of their pupils.

                    This prayer also helps the parents as those who handle
               the great harvest of the new generations; through this prayer
               they  receive  enlightenment  and  grace  from God,  edify  their
               children, keep them away from dangers, educate them in a
               holy  manner,  and  present  them  to  God  in  compliance  with
               their mission.

                    But, how few are the parents such as these, how often   409
               house and family are a dreadful enemy of the human being!
               Education  was  properly  defined:  «The  most  delicate  art
               placed in the most inexpert hands. »

                   Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest...

                         9. PRAYER STRENGTHENING ACTION

                    What  is  the  value  of  action  without  prayer?  Do  not
               people work in vain, if they want to build the house without
               God's  help?  «  Every  good  gift  and  every  perfect  present
               comes from heaven; it comes down from God, the Creator of
               heavenly lights » (James 1, 17).

                    If  we  want  good  ministers  and  holy  vocations  of  elect
               workers  in  the  mystical  harvest,  we must  pray  because  the
               vocation  prayer  as  obedience  to  the  divine  command  is
               indispensable.  In  the  first  centuries  of  the  Church,
               commenting on this passage of St. Matthew,]]></page><page Index="410"><![CDATA[S. Hilary says: «God gives us this gift through prayer. » In his
               fervent prayer to the Most Precious Blood of our Lord Jesus
               Christ,  St.  Albert  the  Great  exclaims:  «  O  Most  Precious
               Blood,  we  adore  you  in  the  holy  Eucharist  where  you  stay
               substantially... Please pour out on the Church, fecundate her
               with the saints, enrich her with angelical souls like flowers in
               the Father's celestial garden to spread their gentle fragrance
               all over the world. » Faber commented on this passage of the
               gospel in his work « Conciones, » quoting St. Jerome (Book 2
               on the letter to the Galathians): « Let us pray to the owner of
               the harvest that he will send out workers to harvest, to reap
               the  Christian  people's  ears  of  grain  which  are  prepared  for
               the Church's future bread, and to gather them in the granary,
               never decaying. »

                    Also  Sacy  in  his  comment  on  the  gospel  says:  «  The
               evangelical  workers'  mission  must  be  the  effect  of  the
               Church's  prayer.»  Blessed  Vincent  Pallotti  published  a  brief
               prayer which begins with:  « For the sacred mysteries oaf the
               human redemption, send, o  Lord, workers in your harvest. »   410
               And St. Louis M. Grignion de Monfort wrote a long, sublime
               prayer  to  bend  divine  goodness  to  grant  such  a  matchless
               mercy. (10)

                    Always  moved  by  the  Holy  Spirit,  the  Church  disposes
               the  Ember  days  in  the  quarterly  three  day  period  of  prayer
               and fasting, which are destined to the sacred ordinations, to
               ask  good  workers  for  the  spiritual  more  than  the  material
               harvest. The gospel says that our Lord Jesus Christ prayed
               all night long before calling the apostles. Thus, he taught us
               that  such  a  great mercy,  which  is  mother  of  many  mercies,
               must  be  obtained  through  great  prayers!  It  cannot  be
               otherwise. God wanted the people to wish and to pray for the
               coming of Jesus Christ in the world. Because the priests are]]></page><page Index="411"><![CDATA[the new Christ, we have to wish and to ask for them through
               prayer  (Speech  at  the  Eucharistic  Congress  of  Catania,
               1905).

                    This prayer also urges to action, because the new clergy
               must originate both from prayer and action. When the Rogate
               prayer  becomes  popular,  it  will  make  pious  and  eminent
               persons understand the great moment of such a prayer and
               the  great moment  of having elect  priests  according  to  God,
               moving  them  to  grant  the  means  (11)  necessary  to  their
               education and success.

                    The  Catholic  institutions  which  aim  at  helping  the  holy
               missions,  strive  to  collect  alms  for  them,  which  is
               praiseworthy. However, it shouldn't be less praiseworthy and
               beneficial adding an extensive advertisement for the vocation
               prayer, in obedience to the divine command; thus, they would
               increase  secular  and  regular  clergies  through  pecuniary,
               moral, and spiritual means.

                    In short, we must pray and work to win good workers to   411
               the holy Church. When we ask God for a favor, we have to
               cooperate in order to reach it more easily. For instance, if we
               pray  for  the  conversion  of  sinners,  our  prayer  is  more
               efficacious and the conversion is easier if we add our means
               and work to convert the sinners.

                    Likewise, we must not be satisfied by only wishing and
               praying to win good workers to the holy Church, but we must
               add means and work to achieve them. Oh, how all things are
               fast bound to each other!



                            10. REMEDY OUT OF FASHION

                    I think that this great remedy has been remembered and
               used very seldom in the last twenty centuries; our Lord Jesus
               Christ's great word has been almost buried,]]></page><page Index="412"><![CDATA[unobserved  in  the  Gospel's  pages.  Perhaps  it  has  been  a
               great punishment that humankind deserved.

                    Ah! We pray for rain, for year's crop, for liberation from
               divine punishments, and for so many topics, but we neglect to
               pray  for  winning  good  evangelical  workers  to  the  mystical
               harvest.

                    A  servant  of  God  once  asked:  «  Lord,  why  don't  you
               send  numerous  priests  according  to  your  Heart  to  the  holy
               Church?  »  Jesus  is  said  to  have  answered:  «  Because  the
               people do not ask enough for them. » This is the reason why
               today good workers are so rare, why millions and millions of
               sours are lacking spiritual help and are deprived of the light of
               truth, which the Catholic priesthood only can give. How few
               the clerics in the seminaries have become!

                    Well  then,  why  don't  we  resort  to  the  infallible  remedy
               our Lord Jesus Christ pointed to with these words: « Pray to
               the  owner  of  the  harvest  that  he  will  send  out  workers  to
               gather in his harvest? » Why don't the souls who love Jesus   412
               Christ  and  his  divine  heart's  interests  lift  up  most  fervent
               prayers  to  win  good  workers  to  the  mystical  harvest?  Why
               don't the prayer books used by the pious souls overflow with
               this  divine  prayer?  Why,  don't  the  Eucharistic  congresses
               pick  up  this  prayer  as  their  primary  subject?  Why  don't  the
               preachers  of  the  divine  word  urge  the  faithful  to  obey  the
               divine command that Jesus gave many times? »

                    Several Pious Unions for the Sanctification of the Clergy
               are greatly esteemed by the people. Various religious orders
               of  nuns  are  commanded  by  rule  to  pray  for  that.  That's  all
               right. We, however, remark that praying directly and explicitly
               for  new,  strong,  holy,  and  powerful  vocations  is  more
               beneficial  and  more  related  to  the  divine  exhortation  or
               command, because we ask]]></page><page Index="413"><![CDATA[the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  to  form  his  saints.  (12)  While
               explaining this saying of our Lord Jesus Christ, Alapide notes
               that when God hears this prayer, all the workers he sends to
               the holy Church are saints.

                    His Eminence Card. Prefect of Propaganda Fide wisely
               implored  and  obtained  from  the  Holy  Father  Pius  XI  the
               introduction  of  a  new  verse  in  the  Litany  of  the  Saints  to
               reduce  the  unfaithful  and  the  dissident  in  the  Mother
               Church's  bosom.  But,  can  it  happen  without  increasing  the
               missionaries'  number?  Can  the  missionaries'  number
               increase  without  fervently  complying  with  our  Lord's
               command?  Who  says  this  prayer?  Whoever  does  not  ask,
               does not receive; whoever prays little, receives little.


                               11. PEOPLE MUST PRAY

                    Which  people  are  obliged  to  pray  for  this  grace  of  the
               graces, this mercy of the mercies?                        413

                    They are:

                    1. The holy Church's bishops and the ecclesiastics.
               The  divine  exhortation  was  specifically  addressed  to  the
               ecclesiastical  order,  or  better  yet,  to  the  Church,  which  is
               represented  by  the  apostles;  in  fact,  Jesus  our  Lord
               addressed those words to them: « He said to his disciples. »
               The Church must pray formally for this purpose, because the
               prayer's mission to win good workers concerns not only each
               faithful  Christian  having  at  heart  the  good  of  souls  but
               concerns  specifically  the  bishops,  the  shepherds  of  the
               mystical flock, to whom the souls are entrusted; in short, the
               living apostles of Jesus Christ.]]></page><page Index="414"><![CDATA[2.  The  superiors  of  the  religious  orders.  They  long  for
               holy vocations to their institutes as much as the bishops do
               for their dioceses.

                    3. The priests. 11 dare to address a warm appeal to the
               priests,  who  are  my  lords.  We  must  get  hold  of  the  new
               generations,  generating  them  to  the  grace  through  the  holy
               baptism and defending them from the rapacious wolves. We,
               however, are very few everywhere. Very few workers! People
               did not ask them, we ourselves did not. We have not used the
               remedy  commanded  by  Jesus  Christ  and,  therefore,  are
               suffering  the  consequences:  hundreds  of  parishes  have  no
               priest. We ought to stir ourselves, work, and .pray!

                    4.  The  clerics.  Several  bishops  asked me  for  vocation-
               prayer-books  for  their  dioceses,  especially  for  the  religious
               communities;  but,  it  is  of  importance  that  they  have
               introduced the recitation of this prayer in their seminaries; that
               helps  very  much  the  culture  and  the  promotion  of  holy
               vocations.  When  this  prayer  is  organized  and  enters  the
               seminaries,  the  clerics  will  have  a  specific  to  follow,   414
               understanding which is the success of their vocation and how
               to  reach  it.  Furthermore,  the  prayers  will  make  them
               experience God's work in themselves for the increase of their
               vocation, knowing that only God may let them become elect
               priests  and  holy  workers  in  the  great  field  of  the  mystical
               harvest.  We  cannot  have  the  «  chosen  race,  the  king's
               priests,  the  holy  nation  »  (1  Peter  2,  9)  through  a  feeble,
               uncertain,  imperfect,  artificial,  man-made  vocation.  Such
               vocations  may  prompt  priests  endowed  with  sacred
               character, but they will never succeed as experience teaches.

                    5. Nuns and sisters. As loving souls of Jesus]]></page><page Index="415"><![CDATA[Christ  as  well  as  zealous  for  his  glory,  nuns  and  sisters
               should pray for holy vocations.

                    O  pious  souls,  souls  lovers  of  Jesus  Christ,  O  souls
               zealous for the interests of the most holy Heart of Jesus and
               his  Most  Precious  Blood;  O  virgins  consecrated  to  Jesus,
               your  divine  spouse,  bound  to  promote  his  glory  and  the
               salvation  of  the  souls;  you  who  are  willing  to  sanctify
               yourselves acquiring merits for the eternal life, please pick up,
               adopt that divine command in your heart: pray continuously,
               do not stop praying to win elect priests, holy and numerous
               workers from divine mercy, because the sound of this prayer
               is pleasant to God's ears. The Song of the Song's words:  «
               Let me hear your voice, for your voice is sweet» (Song 2, 14)
               suit each of you.

                    6.  The  faithful.  The  faithful  must  understand  that  the
               greatest mercy God may have on the people or a city is his
               sending out elect priests, as he did with his only Son Jesus
               said to his disciples: « As the Father sent me, so I send you »
               (Jn.  20,  21).  Vice  versa,  the  greatest punishment  God  may   415
               give is depriving the people of his ministers, or better yet, of
               the priests according to his heart.

                    The  faithful  must  understand  this  duty,  accustoming
               themselves  to  pray  that  the  Lord  send  out  the  priests  to
               catechize,  to  administer  the  sacraments,  and  to  guide  the
               people to eternal life.



                          12. EUCHARIST AND PRIESTHOOD

                    When our Lord Jesus Christ instituted the sacrament of
               the Eucharist giving it to the apostles at the]]></page><page Index="416"><![CDATA[last supper, he was keeping in mind the whole Church along
               with  its  members,  whom  he  had  to  feed  with  the  bread  of
               eternal life.

                    In that event he instituted and conferred his priesthood
               on  the  apostles.,  empowering  them  to  consecrate  his  body
               and  his  Most  Precious  Blood,  as  well  as  to  absolve  the
               people from their sins until the end of time. He did and meant
               it  by  saying:  «  Do  this  in  memory  of  me  ».  Thus,  Christ's
               priesthood is transmitted from bishops to priests, making the
               sacramental presence of Jesus remain until the end of time.

                    So,  Eucharist  and  priesthood  are  born  of  the  adorable
               Heart  of  Jesus  by  a  twin  birth.  (13)  Both  sacraments  are
               complementary to each other. The priesthood was called into
               existence  for  the  consecration  and  administration  of  the
               Eucharist to the people as well as for the absolution of sins.
               The  Eucharist  is  called  into  existence  by  the  consecration
               made by the priests, as established by our Lord at the end of
               his life, which « ended with marvelous order, » as St. Thomas
               Aquinas says in the Pange lingua.                         416

                    The Eucharistic Congresses should not omit mentioning
               the  great  command of  Jesus'  Heart  zeal:  « Pray,  therefore,
               etc. » We cannot understand how the Congresses' organizers
               may  exclude  from  the  plans  to  honor  the  most  Holy
               Sacrament the plans concerning the formation of numerous,
               holy priests as well as the plan to make the faithful lovers of
               Jesus  Christ  obey  this  divine  command:  «  Pray,  therefore,
               etc. » (Note to the Hymns on July first, 1926).]]></page><page Index="417"><![CDATA[NOTES

               though they were  raised. from  the  rocks.  God  is  powerful  to  do that,

               heaven,  almost  divine  beings,  wonder  of  heroism  and  holiness.  Who
               could  deny  that?  How  many  are  the  ministers  of  God  shining   in

               needlessly:   "Pray,  therefore,  etc."  and  that  obeying   perfectly   this
               divine  command    does  not  attain    more    and    holier  workers  to    the

                   (6)   «That he will send out workers to gather in his harvest. If the
               harvest belongs to  God,  how  is  it  that we  must pray  God  to send
               out workers to his harvest? The reason is that God has disposed to   do

               they say such a prayer.]]></page><page Index="418"><![CDATA[They obtain from God what they ask for. For instance, the Lord will
               send  out  a  powerful  vocation  to  an  elect  on  earth  because  of  the
               assiduous,  humble  prayer  of  someone.  A  person  will  hear  in  his
               innermost: "Follow me!" Still remaining free, the people cannot oppose
               God's voice; therefore, the chosen one enters the sanctuary, is endowed
               with understanding and spirit, is lighted with zeal for the sacred ministry,
               and becomes an apostle or a missionary, or a pastor or a doctor or a
               preacher or a savior of souls. He immolates the divine victim every day.
               Through the divine office he wails between the vestibule and the altar,
               spreads  Christ's  presence,  edifies  the  Church;  he  is  diferrent  from  a
               common human being. Who knows the good he produces to the world
               by his ministry? Such good will increase indefinitely until the end of the
               time. God will reward this elect worker with ineffable prizes, but also the
               person who obtained that vocation by praying: '"Owner of the harvest,
               owner  of  the  harvest,  send  workers  to  your  harvest"  will  share  those
               prizes. St. Vincent de Paul said: "No work can be equal to the formation
               of  one  priest";  therefore,  anyone  who  is  able  to  help  the  formation  of
               priests has to do it with a will; but to win priests according to God, let us
               pray, let us pray, let us make other people pray the Lord to send them
               out! "Rogate!" Pray, says the Lord to everyone. Let us pray» (News and
               rules for the Sacred Allies supporters).
                   (8)  Our divine Savior's example evidently shows the importance of
               this prayer he suggested almost by commanding.  When he was about
               to  call  the  first  ministers  of  the  new  law  of  grace,  those  who  were   418
               destined to be the first fecund seed of the Catholic priesthood, what did
               he do? Which means did he choose to form the 12 apostles' vocation?
               Before   seeking   and   calling   them,   he   retired   on   the mountain
               and   prayed!  He  prayed  "on  the  mountain"  to  make  his ardent
               prayer ascend to the  Father directly; prayed  "in the night" so  that  no
               human    approach    distract      him    from    the    enterprise      he  was
               communicating   with   the   Father;   prayed   "all   night   long"   in order
               to   implore   the   Father  by   sacrifice;   prayed   "all   night   long,
               shedding  tears  and  crying  'to  be  heard  by  the  Father'  because  of  his
               reverence!"  Still  soaked  with  tears  and    perspiration,  as  soon  as  he
               came down from the mountain  he called the apostles to  make the first-
               fruits  of  his eternal  priesthood. What a  great  teaching    he  gave  us  to
               make  us  understand  how  much  we  must  pray  to  obtain  so  great  a
               graces (News and rules for the Sacred Allies supporters).

               the   harvest:   the  harvest   is   abundant,   but  the   workers are few;
               pray to the Lord of the harvest that he will send out the workers to his
               harvest. All of you say often this ejaculatory prayer: Lord of the harvest,
               Lord  of  the  harvest,  Lord  of  the  harvest,  send  out  workers  to  your
               harvest.  Please  join  this prayer to the  merits of Jesus Christ's Most
               Precious Blood and to his zeal for the glory of  the   Father and   the
               salvation   of  souls.  Almighty   God,   creator of the souls, send out
               numerous workers  to  gather  in your harvest.  We commend  the souls,
               who  are  so  dear  to  you  »  (News  and  rules  for  the  Sacred  Allies

                   (11)    Writing   to   Blessed   Guido   M.   Conforti,   archbishop   of
               Parma and founder of the Xavier's Missionnaries, our padre pointed out
               the necessity to join prayer with action  (In this case  begging for  the
               missions),   giving  preeminence  to  prayer;  after  praying  we can and
               must  seek  contributions.  «  The  matter  is  to  be  managed  so  evidently
               and   clearly    that    the  faithful     must     know    that their   alms  will  be
               blessed  and  two  cents  will  be  worth  2000    liras  when  their  cents  are   419
               joined  to  the  prayer  commanded  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ...  "Pray,
               therefore!"  Please  consider  the  therefore!  Our  Lord  did  not  say:
               therefore, work to form the priests; therefore,  gather  money, etc., but
               he said: "THEREFORE, PRAY!" Both action and contribution for such an
               aim  are  holy because  they are  implied  in  the  divine thought.  But,  it
               is strange  that what  has  been   clearly  said  hardly receives attention,
               whereas what is supposed to be implied receives full attention.»
                   (12)  «The prayers the  religious communities say  by  rule,  not by
               vow,  for  the  sanctification  of  the  clergy  do  not  concern  directly
               numerous,  holy  vocations,   but   the   present   clergy's   sanctification.
               Surely,   this  intention  is  holy,  most  holy,  and  those  who  say   this
               prayer gain merits, but the results of this prayer are scarce because they
               face  the  human  will  which  opposes  the  divine  grace.  This  appears
               evident in the consecrated persons who do not improve their holiness.
                   On  the  contrary,  the  prayer  or  rogation,  which  is  based  on  the
               Rogate commanded by Jesus Christ, regards directly the sending out of
               the  workers  to  his  harvest.  The  holy  vocations  of  new  priests  are
               contained in the sending out, because it is God's promise to hear such a
               prayer. He will raise persons favorably disposed, elected youths who are
               dear to his Heart. He can infuse in them the powerful]]></page><page Index="420"><![CDATA[breath of holy vocation which comes from the Holy Spirit. This call
               is  irresistible  because  of  the  Holy  Spirit  operating  a  divine,  impulsive
               force in the person who is called to the divine service and sacrifice; still
               remaining free, the person is drawn to answer the call and has no quiet,
               no peace until he accepts and acts upon the powerful impulse.
                   These are the true called, the priests the Holy Spirit formed on the
               ground of the divine prayer commanded by our Lord Jesus Christ: "Pray,
               therefore," etc.» (From various notes by the Padre).
                   In  another  letter  to Blessed  Quido  M. Conforti,  our padre defines
               the  nature  of  the  Rogate  prayer,  «which  is  different  from  the  prayers
               aiming at the sanctification of the clergy. These prayers are excellent;
               but  Your  Excellence  know  very  well  which  grace  is  needed  to  rouse
               again an unrestrained minister of the Lord and to push him again in the
               way  of  sanctification!...  Answering,  however,  the  divine  command  is
               different!  Here,  the  matter  is  vocation  from  the  Holy  Spirit,  who
               transformed the shy, insecure apostles into powerful vocations after ten
               days  of  prayer.  God  is  having  such  vocations  in  his  hands,  but  he  is
               expecting that the prayer commanded by him snatches them out of his
               hands to come down in the hearts well prepared. Who knows how many
               hundreds of thousands of vocations the Lord keeps in store? But, how
               can people claim to have them without praying, while God commands us
               to pray for it? »
                   (13) Our padre refers to a hymn's stanza in honor of the Madonna:
               «Remember: in a twin birth — in the mystical rite, he gave the world —   420
               the best of him, that is the finest — the Eucharist, the infinite gift — and
               the eternal priesthood.»]]></page><page Index="421"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXII

                         YOU SHALL NOT SPARE YOURSELF

                   While praying to God that he may fill the holy Church
               and  the  world  with  good  evangelical  workers,  the
               congregants of our least Institute will strive with ardent
               zeal  and  sacrifice  to  be  good  evangelical  workers
               themselves in the Lord's harvest. I see this duty as the
               Immediate,  legitimate  consequence  which  derives  from
               the appreciation, from the untiring culture, and from the
               meditation  on  the  divine  Rogate  as  well  as  from  the
               limitless  obedience  and  from  the  faithful  execution  of
               this command.

                   As  a  consequence  of  all  this,  I  will  never  spare
               myself  in  the  work  for  the  Lord's  glory  and  the  souls'
               salvation,  considering  myself  unfaithful,  lazy,  and
               indifferent  when  I  am  not  thirsty  for  souls.  Therefore,  I
               will excite in myself hunger and thirst for souls through
               meditation,  fervent  prayer,  work,  and  self-denial.  But,   421
               whether  I  feel  or  whether  I  do  not  feel  this  hunger  and
               thirst  for  souls,  with  God's  help  and  my  constant
               determination  I  will  never  stop  working  In  the  mystical
               harvest of souls.

                   To  fruitfully  work  for  the  sanctification  and  the
               salvation  of  others,  first  I  will  endeavor  to  sanctify
               myself.  Keeping  In  mind  the  saints'  teaching  that  our
               Lord  Jesus  Christ  loves  one  soul  as  much  as  all souls
               together,  and  that  he  would  have  endured  his  Passion
               even  for  one  soul,  I  will  esteem  souls  so  much  as  to
               spend  my  life  in  suffering,  in  working,  and  sacrificing
               myself  even  for  one  soul.  Because  when  I  entered  the
               order and when I was ordained priest the Lord endowed
               me with gifts for my religious and priestly ministry, I will
               use them for the divine glory and the salvation of souls,
               knowing that I have to give a strict account of such gifts
               to God In the judgment day.]]></page><page Index="422"><![CDATA[1. ENERGETIC ZEAL

                    Charity produces in itself the fervor and the flame which
               rise  up  to  God,  and  draw  from  God's  love  and  glory  the
               reasons to work more intensely on earth. Charity brings about
               zeal for God's glory and the souls' salvation. It substitutes the
               world's selfishness with altruism by involving the people in the
               work for the good of others. They work continuously for God,
               for the truth, for the good of their neighbor, and because they
               are unable to embrace the whole world with their action, they
               suffer for the evil which overflows in society (On the death of
               L. Costa Sajia).

                    The  spirit  of  sacrifice  is  the  outcome  of  zeal,  which
               should characterize the spirit of each Rogationist. Therefore,
               he will spare no sacrifice for God's glory and the souls' good,
               but  will  face  work,  suffering,  inconvenience,  contradictions,
               humiliation,  and  everything,  giving  up  Ms  time,  rest,  quiet,
               health, and himself to sake even one soul (C.R.).

                    While  praying  to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that  he  will   422
               send  out  numerous,  holy  workers  to  the  holy  Church,  the
               Rogationists of Jesus' Heart strive with all their strength and
               God's  help  to  become  themselves  workers  of  the  harvest.
               They  will  perform  the  ecclesiastical  ministry,  such  as:
               worship, confessions, preaching, missions, teaching Christian
               doctrine  to  children...,  and  will  commit  themselves  to  the
               spiritual  and  temporal  beneficence  through  the  orphanages,
               the evangelization of the poor, etc. For the glory of God and
               the good of the souls the pious order will give preference to
               the  education  of  the  youths  who  aspire  to  become  priests,
               being  ready  to  help  the  diocesan  seminaries  when  the
               bishops  ask  for  it,  and  the  order  has members  qualified  for
               such important, holy office (C.R.).]]></page><page Index="423"><![CDATA[With God's help, the Rogationists of Jesus' Heart commit
               themselves to the work of priestly ministry and to the spiritual
               and the temporal beneficence.

                    As to the priestly ministry: 1) The Rogationists will direct
               the churches and the oratories entrusted to them by attracting
               the  people  through  assiduous,  untiring,  holy  ministry  and
               through the industries that charity and zeal will suggest. 2) To
               facilitate the concourse of the people, especially the poor, the
               seats  of  the  church  will  be  free  of  charge.  3)  They  will
               promote feasts, pious unions for children and adults, general
               communions,  retreats,  and  the  like.  4)  They  will  foster  love
               toward our Lord Jesus Christ in all his mysteries, such as: the
               child Jesus, the suffering Jesus, and the Holy Sacrament. 5)
               The  center  of  all  devotions  and  activities  will  be  the  Holy
               Sacrament.  Our  order  will  love,  honor,  and  court  the  Holy
               Sacrament  with  such  a  bliss  as  to  be  called  a  Eucharistic
               Order. Besides the yearly feasts of the most Holy Sacrament,
               the  spreading  of  its  worship  and  the  daily  Communion,  the
               order  will  celebrate  the  real  presence  of  the  most  Holy
               Sacrament through the Eucharistic Day on July First, as we   423
               have been doing from the beginning of the order. 6) Love of
               the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary  will  be  fostered  with  the  same
               affection and fervor. 7) For a complete and fecund teaching of
               the Christian doctrine to children, the best programs will be
               carried out with love and zeal, while catechism contests and
               rewards will attract and win the love of children. The teaching
               of catechism to the girls will be entrusted to the sisters, who
               will  organize  the  first  Communions  on  special  holidays.  8)
               The  Rogationists  will  hold  the  missions  in  the  abandoned
               towns and to the unprivileged classes as the worthiest work,
               using the mission's most reliable systems.

                    Everytime the Rogationists are called for the dying, they
               will assist them charitably, giving them the sacraments]]></page><page Index="424"><![CDATA[and preparing them for the great passage to eternity through
               holy  exhortations.  The  Rogationists  will  also  concern
               themselves with legitimatising marriages (C.R).

                    To answer faithfully their holy vocation, the Little Retreat
               sisters  will  strive  to achieve their  own  sanctification  through
               religious  virtues  as  well  as  to  become  good  workers  in  the
               holy Church. Specifically: they will commit themselves to the
               education  of  abandoned  orphans,  to  the  help  and  the
               evangelization  of  the  poor,  and  to  any  eventual  charitable
               work, to which they are called. They will perform everything to
               please  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  his  most  holy  mother,  to
               earn merits for eternal life, and to foster the salvation of souls
               (R.L.P.).

                    The  sisters  who  are  committed  to  the  education  and
               success  of  the  orphans  must  begin  and  persevere  in  their
               work with a spirit of sacrifice. They will not spare themselves
               nor  their  habits,  their  spiritual  comfort  and  delight  included,
               because they lose nothing of what they renounce, they rather   424
               grow richer in God's eyes (S.I.G.).

                    To immolate themselves for the glory of God, to please
               the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  and  to  work  for  the  holy
               Church's needs and for the salvation and the sanctification of
               souls,  the  sisters  will  nurture  the  spirit  of  self-denial,
               considering  no  work  or  sacrifice  as  too  heavy.  With  such  a
               disposition  and  by  renouncing  their  will  and  opinion,  the
               sisters  will  offer  themselves  as  victims  of  holy  obedience,
               victims of the work they undertake with all their physical and
               moral  strength,  as  well  as  victims  of  the  deprivation,
               humiliation, and suffering that the Lord will permit. They will
               long  for  nothing  else  but  to  please  the  most  holy  Heart  of
               Jesus and to save souls (D.S.S.).

                    To  fulfill  their  fourth  vow,  they  will  combine action  with
               prayer to win good workers to the holy Church. The]]></page><page Index="425"><![CDATA[action  may  be:  1)  teaching  others  the  vocation  prayer;  2)
               educating  and  exhorting  children;  3)  working  and  begging
               alms to help the poor clerics the saving will be placed into the
               Peter's pence box; (1) 4) educating the orphans, praying for
               everything  and  for  all,  assisting  the  sick,  doing  works  of
               charity, etc. (Purpose of the fourth vow, July 19, 1888).


                    Your name is Daughters of Divine Zeal. You are wearing
               the  emblem  of  the  divine  Heart  along  with  the  evangelical
               words: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest that he
               will send out workers to gather in his harvest. »  Both name
               and  evangelical  emblem  urge  you  to  promote  with  all  your
               strength and self-denial the adorable Heart of Jesus' interests
               and  everything  which  concerns  his  glory  and  the  good  of
               souls. From the time you have committed yourselves to the
               divine  zeal,  which  made  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  exclaim:  «
               Zeal for your house devours me » (Ps. 69, 9), you are called
               to the office of Martha and Mary Magdalene.

                    Since  the  world  is  full of  souls  that  are  being  lost,  you   425
               shall  not  seek  your  salvation  only,  but  you  shall  snatch  as
               many souls as you can from eternal ruin. Please gather the
               abandoned  orphans.  Teach,  educate,  and  feed  them.  Each
               soul you save is a seed of eternal salvation for many others,
               who will become your glorious crown in heaven. Please long,
               be hungry and thirsty for the remnant souls you are unable to
               save.  Be  not  indifferent  in  the  face  of  the  ruin  of  even  one
               soul, for Jesus Christ paid out his blood for that soul that is as
               precious as all souls are together (Speech, St. Joseph 1908).


               2. FALSE ZEAL

                    We must beware of the enemy's deceit, of selfishness,
               and, particularly, of the false zeal which kills meekness]]></page><page Index="426"><![CDATA[True zeal is born of charity and is gifted like charity, as St.
               Paul says: « Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or
               conceited  or  proud;  love  is  not  ill-mannered  or  selfish  or
               irritable; love does not keep a record of wrongs; love is not
               happy with evil, but is happy with the truth. Love' never gives
               up: its faith, hope, and patience never fail. » True zeal is a
               living,  ardent,  calm,  an  always  industrious  flame  which  is
               concerned  with  everything  and  everyone,  but  without  dash
               and  rashness.  Whoever  can  be  more  zealous  than  Jesus
               Christ, who was devoured by zeal? And yet, he said: « Learn
               from me, because I am gentle and humble in spirit » (Mt. 11,
               29).  Did  he  ever  get  angry?  Once,  when  he  demanded
               respect for God's house. For the remnant 33 years and in a
               special  way  during  the  ignominy,  the  injustice,  and  the
               suffering of his Passion he let the executioners drive him to
               Calvary like a lamb, without lamenting. The Psalmist had said
               that he would behave like one who scolds no one. St. Francis
               of Sales says that the angels are extremely zealous for the
               salvation  of  their  proteges,  but  they  are  not  at  all  uneasy.
               When  zeal  becomes  agitated,  it  shows  itself  to  be  false,
               because it is written: « God was not in the wind, » and our   426
               Lord recommended: « Do not be worried and upset » (Jn. 14,
               1). False  zeal  comes  from  selfishness, not  from the  love  of
               God or of one's neighbor. Instead of correcting and edifying,
               false  zeal  scandalizes,  sets  bad  example,  and  causes  bad
               results.

                    Our  order  has  to  shine  with  pure  charity.  The  Roga-
               tionists who want to be really concerned with the interest of
               Jesus' Heart must do their utmost with prayer and action to
               reach a lively, ardent, calm, and moderate zeal.

                    The person consecrated to Jesus must be zealous first
               for punishing and restraining himself as well as for]]></page><page Index="427"><![CDATA[seeking  his  own  sanctification  diligently.  When  the  zeal  is
               practiced interiorly, it may be less moderate, but for exterior
               acts of humiliation and penance it must follow the rules and
               obedience.  The  interior  annihilation  of  selfishness,  opinion,
               will, and egotism must be preferred to the exterior penitential
               acts.

                    The  Rogationist  will  long  for  the  sanctification  and  the
               eternal salvation of all souls, no one excepted. To reach this
               goal,  he  will  ask  the  Lord  for  numerous,  elect  priests,
               numerous  saints  of  heroic  virtue,  at  least  two  saints  for  a
               thousand people on earth. Meantime, he will sacrifice himself
               for the glory of God and the salvation of souls (R.S.).



                               3. THE. DIVINE FOUNDER

                    The loving, fecund, dutiful, and continuous center of this
               pious  institute  of  Jesus'  interests  is  Jesus  in  the  Holy
               Sacrament.  From  now  on,  the  people  must  know  that  the   427
               true, effective, and immediate founder of this pious institute is
               Jesus in the Holy Sacrament. Of this foundation we may say:
               «  God  did  something  new.  »  In  fact,  usually  he  puts  a
               flounder rich with his graces and gifts in his institutions. This
               institute instead, which was born to promote his Heart's divine
               command that has been neglected for so many centuries, has
               our Lord himself in the sacred tabernacle as the real founder.
               Graces, help, enlightenment, and providence poured out from
               his divine heart in the Sacrament.

                    The pious institute began rising in the miserable, abject
               slums of the poor. After a few years since the priest set foot
               there, a little house was rented and transformed into a little
               chapel,  where  the  first  mass  was  celebrated  on  a  little
               wooden altar. Thus, Jesus in the]]></page><page Index="428"><![CDATA[Holy  Sacrament  began  taking  possession  of  those  places,
               sowing  the  seed  of  this  new  plant  in  the  poor's  field.  The
               sporadic celebration of the mass was the sporadic presence
               of  Jesus;  but  his  permanent  presence  in  the  Eucharistic
               Sacrament was indispensable for the seed to take root and
               fructify.

                    Then,  a  singular  loving  expectation  for  the  Lord  in  the
               Sacrament was cultivated among those poor, but especially
               in  the  hearts  of  their  children,  boys  and  girls  who  were
               attending the school of catechism alternatively, while some of
               them were already sheltered.

                    The little chapel was enlarged by joining another house;
               a better altar with a tabernacle replaced the old one, and the
               holy  expectation  for  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament  was  cultivated
               through more prayers, teachings, and songs. To foster in the
               people's  hearts  the  wish  for  the  coming  of  God,  who  is
               concealed in the Sacrament, the tabernacle was kept open.
               The expectation increased for two years.
                                                                         428
                    It was the expectation for the divine Messiah, who had to
               be born in this new Bethlehem as God-man concealed in the
               Eucharist, to dwell among the children of men until the end of
               time, to find his delights in the pure hearts.

                    When  the  common  expectation  was  fully  developed,
               Jesus  came.  He  came  on  July  first,  1886,  during  the  cele-
               bration  of  the  holy  mass,  while  the  people  in  the  adorned
               chapel were longing, singing, and praying to him devoutly.

                    He came to remain permanently. He came as a king to
               set  his  kingdom  in  the  midst  of  his  citizens,  as  a  good
               shepherd  to  feed  the  sheep  entrusted  to him,  the  flock  that
               had  to  live  with  him  without  fear.  He  came  as  the  divine
               farmer to cultivate his little plant, which had the seed of his
               divine ROGATE in suffering and mortification.

                    He came as a very loving father in the midst of his]]></page><page Index="429"><![CDATA[children to form a small family living on his body and blood,
               and  to  make  it  able  to  receive  from  his  divine  lips  the
               command of his heart's divine zeal: « PRAY, THEREFORE,
               TO THE OWNER OF THE HARVEST THAT HE WILL SEND
               OUT WORKERS TO GATHER IN HIS HARVEST. »

                    When Jesus came in the Sacrament, the pious institute
               was yet a bambino in the number of its members, but, it rose
               as a small caravan to start a very intricate pilgrimage. It was
               always supported by the true Ark of the Covenant, which was
               not containing the symbolical manna, but the real bread from
               heaven.

                    From  that  time  we  have  been  renewing  Jesus'  most
               loving  coming  to  the  pious  institute  through  our  devoted
               preparation for the beautiful feast of the Eucharistic Day on
               July first.

                    This pious institute's trial sometimes was very sorrowful,
               and it lasted about 25 years; but its divine founder, Jesus in
               the  Sacrament,  supported  and  helped  his  foundation  in   429
               everything.  In  those  times,  needs  almost  suffocated  the
               institute, but we turned to Jesus in the Sacrament and the sky
               cleared up. Jesus was our providence and our health.


                                 4. PAY ATTENTION!

                    Please pay attention to the report of the priest, promoter,
               or better yet, to the priest who set things moving under the
               Lord's initiative.

                    The trial became extreme and most suffocating after 22
               years. The priest's last means was resorting to Jesus in the
               Sacrament.  He  wrote  the  most  fervent,  cogent,  convincing
               petition  to  touch  the  inmost  feelings  of  Jesus'  Heart  in  the
               Sacrament as with an arrow. After opening the tabernacle  -
               God forgive, if it happened so - or]]></page><page Index="430"><![CDATA[perhaps  after  the  Holy  Communion  during  the  mass,  he
               placed that petition under the sacred pyx.

                    Jesus  accepted  it.  Since  then,  the  sky  began  clearing,
               and Jesus in the host began spreading new splendors, which
               became beams of light, grace, and providence. The institute
               began, increasing.

                    All this has been written to perpetuate the memory of it,
               and  to  make  each  one  bear  in  mind  that  Jesus  in  the
               Sacrament  is  the  author  of  this  pious  institute,  which  is
               consecrated  to  his  divine,  real  heart,  always  loving  and
               palpitating  in  the  holy  tabernacle;  that  Jesus  is  always
               working in the midst of us with the same grace and with the
               enlightenments  he  irradiates  continuously  from  the  burning
               furnace of his divine Heart in the Sacrament.

                    For that reason we have to direct to the adorable Jesus
               in  the  Sacrament  all  our  thanks,  praises,  affections,  sighs,
               desires, thoughts, love, and our being. He must be the center,
               the  life,  the  existence,  the  hope,  the  perseverance,  and  all   430
               things  for  us  and  for  the  future  congregants.  For  the
               Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  and  for  those  who  live  with  them
               may Jesus in the Sacrament be the mystical beehive, around
               which they rotate, resting and producing the sweetest honey
               of the virtues that please Jesus, supreme goodness.



                               5. FEAST ON JULY FIRST

                    This is a first-rate festivity for the pious institute of Jesus'
               Heart interests.

                    The  order,  the  congregants,  and  the  houses,  no  one
               excepted,  offer  this  yearly  tribute  of  love  and  faith  to  the
               adorable  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament,  who  is  the  center  of  the
               institute's  love,  sacrifices,  atonements,  thanksgivings,
               petitions, prayers, practices of piety, and holy hopes. He]]></page><page Index="431"><![CDATA[is the fountain of the past and present graces, mercies, and
               favors as well as of the future graces that he will pour out on
               this  pious  institute  and  its  members.  This  feast  is  the
               expression  of  our  gratitude  for  Jesus'  loving  sweetest
               dwelling  in  the  midst  of  us  despite  our  failings  and
               unfaithfulness, our languid faith and incomplete answer to his
               love and inspirations.

                    This festivity is associated to the first permanent coming
               of Jesus in the Sacrament in the midst of the poor beggars
               and their children, on July first 1886, when the institute was
               among the slums of Avignone Houses in Messina. After two
               years of expectation, which was cultivated by instructions and
               practices  of  piety  before  the  empty  tabernacle  in  the
               temporary  oratory,  the  adorable  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  coming
               down  from  the  right  hand  of  the  Father,  from  heaven  of
               heavens, arrived during the mass, in the solemn moment of
               the consecration, taking his dwelling in that tabernacle.

                    Beginning  with  the  first  anniversary  in  1887,  the  loving
               expectation  is  renewed  every  year,  and  we  hope  it  will  be   431
               always renewed with the Lord's help.



                           6. EUCHARISTIC PROCESSIONS

                    On  Corpus  Christi  and  on  other  festivities,  the  internal
               procession with the most adorable Eucharistic Sacrament will
               be  organized  with  the  permission  of  the  ecclesiastical
               authority  These  processions  may  be planned  in  the  houses
               which  have  ample  rooms,  corridors,  gardens,  and  wide
               terraces.

                    Beginning  with  Pangs  Lingua,  the  sacred  Latin  hymns
               will  be  sung  in  choral  manner  during  the  procession.  The
               psalms, Magnificat,  Laudate  Dominum,  and others  canticles
               may be used. If the procession lasts long, also]]></page><page Index="432"><![CDATA[Italian hymns such as the one of July first may be used. The
               sacristan  or  another  sister  will  prepare  an  altar  with  lighted
               candles  and  corporal  at  a  station.  When  the  procession
               arrives, the Holy Sacrament will be placed on the altar. After
               spending some time in adoration and prayer, the sisters will
               sing  again  the  Tantum  Ergo,  before  the  priests  gives  the
               blessing.

                    The  procession  may  return  to  the  church  through  the
               same  or  another  or  a  shorter  way,  depending  on  time.  Te
               Deum is the appropriate hymn during the return, unless it is
               sung in the church or in the oratory.

                    All must be mindful that our Lord distributes great graces
               and mercies while he passes through in procession, and that
               the people may obtain the favors they did not obtain before.

                    When our Lord passed through the cities of Judea or the
               streets of Jerusalem accompanied by his disciples, the pious
               women, and the crowd,  how many graces he granted! How
               many miracles he worked!                                  432

                    The  processions  in  the  holy  Church,  in  the  Catholic
               cities, in the towns, in the houses of the religious communities
               are the repetition of the processions, travels, and walks that
               Jesus did in Judea and Jerusalem. Just as the deaf or mute
               or  blind  or  paralytic  or  lepers  or  victims  of  oppression  of
               Jesus'  time  were  liberated  or  were  granted  the  favors,  so
               during  the  processions,  when  the  same  Jesus  walks
               concealed in the Holy Sacrament with the same  charity and
               his  divine  Heart  open,  the  persons  who  follow  him  praying
               with faith, loving trust, and profound humility can obtain the
               spiritual  or  temporal  graces,  on  condition  that  such  graces
               improve  the  well-being  of  their  soul.  The  procession  is  the
               time to pray for ourselves and for the interests of his divine]]></page><page Index="433"><![CDATA[Heart.  The  prayers  may  be,  said  mentally  or  intentionally,
               even when the people sing psalms or praise.

                    When our Lord in the Sacrament is placed on the attar,
               the  community  may  present  the  petition  it  prepared
               beforehand in order to win special graces.

                    After re-entering the church or the oratory, it is advisable
               that the priest make an exhortation to the community before
               the blessing (S.D.D.Z.). (2)



                            7. EUCHARISTIC CONGRESSES

               At your congresses what sublime sights!
               You see people and people waving,
               Crowds, multitudes, levites,
               Even the insecure and the old bending.

                    We are referring to the sublime Eucharistic congresses   433
               that  .are  triumphing  all  over  the  Catholic  world.  They  are
               planned by a commission of high ecclesiastical personalities
               together  with  lay  Catholics  of  rank,  who  gather  around  the
               organizing authority to define the best way of honoring Jesus
               in  the  Sacrament.  This  planning  is  the  first  phase.  The
               second phase puts the plan in action.

                    The  momentous  gathering  of  the  people  is  planned
               beforehand  by  prelates  of  the  holy  Church,  bishops,  arch-
               bishops,  and  cardinals,  according  to  the  congress'  im-
               portance.  Usually,  the  Holy  Father  entrusts  a  cardinal  with
               representing him; by so doing the pope leads the people . to
               understand the meaning of the real presence of Jesus Christ,
               God-man in the consecrated host.

                    The Eucharistic congress lasts for a few days; the clergy
               of the various churches strive to prepare the population to the
               great solemnity through preaching, confessions]]></page><page Index="434"><![CDATA[and  Holy  Communion  as  well  as  by  exposing  the  Blessed
               Sacrament for adoration. The main church or the cathedral of
               the city where the congress takes place exposes the Blessed
               Sacrament for a few days, even by night. In the last morning,
               general  Communion  of  the  people  and  first  Communion  of
               children   are   organized   with   impressive   solemnity:
               Communions are by the thousands. At last, the organization
               reaches the summit degree with the afternoon procession of
               the  Holy  Sacrament  escorted  by  the  clergy  and  imposing
               concourse of people.

                    Since the purpose of the Congress is to bring together
               many people, we note that the concourse and the crowds are
               always so great that only an obvious concourse of omnipotent
               grace may explain it. The people of any class and condition
               who  participate  in  the  solemn  procession  come  from  far-off
               towns  and  cities  on  foot,  by  train,  cars,  etc.;  they  are
               gentlemen,  workers,  ladies,  titled  persons,  members  of
               parliament, and crowds.

                    Unbelievers  are  as  astounded  as  they  are  thoughtful.   434
               Some of them even follow the procession, which lasts several
               hours,  and  no  one  gets  tired.  The  participants  numbered  a
               million  in  the  Genoa  Eucharistic  congress,  where  the  Holy
               Father's  Cardinal  Legate  gave  the  solemn  blessing  from  a
               ship,  prepared  by  the  government.  Also  the  king  was
               represented by a deputy.

                    We put a question: what do people see in the Eucharistic
               congresses?  Do  they  see  a  statue  of  a  saint  or  the  Virgin
               Mary carved by the chief worldly artist such as Michelangelo?
               Or perhaps a most attractive picture of Our Lady's miraculous
               image  by  a  painter  such  as  Raphael?  Not  at  all.  Nothing
               fascinates eyes or sense. The people see a wafer of  a few
               centimeters  in  diameter;  which  is  closed  in  a  monstrance
               carried by a Lord's minister]]></page><page Index="435"><![CDATA[We could even say that almost all the people see nothing
               because of the crowds, and yet they rush, pray, and become
               excited.

                    In Chicago, the Americans prepared a Eucharistic Con-
               gress, which surpassed all the preceding ones. Preparations
               such  as  hotels  built  at  record  speed  and  a  choir  of  50,000
               children, who sang the mass of the angels under the direction
               of 600 sisters, astounded the crowds. Plenty of bishops and
               cardinals participated.

                    We  put  again  the  question:  what  do  the  people  see?
               They see a baked wafer of flour!

                    But,  God's  ardent  spirit  breathes  through  these  Eu-
               charistic congresses powerfully, and raises such a feeling of
               faith that attracts, prevails over, and draws. It is the triumph of
               Jesus Christ as king of the world. The air itself seems to be
               repeating: Jesus Christ conquers, Jesus Christ reigns, Jesus
               Christ  rules!  Without  understanding  how,  everyone  knows   435
               that the small consecrated wafer has only the appearance of
               bread, but under that appearance there is Jesus Christ. He
               passes  in  the  midst  of  the  crowds  as  he  did  in  Judea  and
               Galilee.  Faith  makes  the  people  see  him  benign,  sweet,
               gentle,  smiling,  and  pouring  out  graces  everywhere  with
               inexhaustible  abundance!  But  those  who  see  through  his
               sweetest heart, they feel his sadness for the sins of the world
               and for the perdition of so many persons Who are obstinate in
               sin!

                    Happy  are  those  who  attend  these  Eucharistic  Con-
               gresses!  However,  those  who  are  not  able  to  attend  them,
               may follow the programs and the manifestations in spirit and
               recollection; thus, through faith, devotion, and reception of the
               sacraments they receive the same abundant graces from, the
               very loving Jesus in the Holy Sacrament.

                    We dare say that through the Eucharistic congresses our
               Lord Jesus Christ makes the world aware of his]]></page><page Index="436"><![CDATA[presence,  and  his  faith  subsists,  notwithstanding  its  in-
               creasing unrest (Note to the Hymns on July first, 1926).



                                  8. DAY SCHOOLS

                    A great deal of good may be done to children with the
               kindergarten and to young girls with the day boarding school.
               The sister master will teach the young girls sewing, and cuts
               of cloth, and the like, but before starting the work they all will
               say  the  prayer  to  invoke  the  divine  help  and  to  direct
               everything to the glory of God and to their own sanctification.
               Also the work-time will be closed with a prayer.

                    The  sister  will  see  that  silence  is  preserved  in  the  day
               boarding  school  every  day.  When  she  needs  to  speak,  she
               will  do  so  at  a  low  voice,  teaching  the  students  to  do  the
               same.

                    She will provide the children with half an hour of spiritual   436
               reading during the work, will teach Christian doctrine to those
               who  are  able  to  read  from  text-books,  and  by  words  to  the
               little ones. Another sister will help her (S.D.D.Z.). (3)

                    The  sisters  will  fulfill  the  aims  of  the  foundation  by
               teaching  Christian  doctrine  to  the  young  girls  with  zeal  and
               holy fervor. (4)

                    They  will  teach  catechism  diligently,  in  support  and  in
               compliance  with  the  parish  program  by  giving  appropriate
               explanations and lessons of history. The sisters will inspire in
               the  children's  hearts  holy  fear  of  God,  horror  of  sin,  love
               toward  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  the  most  holy  Virgin,  St.
               Joseph,  the  angels,  the  saints,  the  holy  Church,  the  Holy
               Father, as well as love of their neighbor, mercy on the poor,
               and fondness of holy virtues. Every day all of them will say
               specific prayers and will have spiritual]]></page><page Index="437"><![CDATA[reading, especially on the Passion of our Lord, with a brief
               explanation. The children will be given careful attention in
               their preparation for confession and Holy Communion. They
               will go in group to the Sunday mass, and will be assisted in
               the adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and in the reception
               of Holy Communion.


                    To win the children's love, the sisters will be attentive of
               their well being, giving special attention to those who are in
               need. They will lead them in singing devout songs, in praying
               for good workers to the holy Church, and in joining our pious
               unions. When the children improve with the help of the Lord,
               the  sisters  will  form  the  association  of  Daughters  of  Mary,
               engaging  them  in  various  activities  as,  for  instance,  the
               festive oratory and by taking walks outdoors (H.S.E.). (5)

                    The day school, aiming at teaching femin4ne skills, must
               guide  the  students  step  by  step  to  cut  cloth  and  to  sew
               garments  and  to master  the  gentle  works  of  the  loom,  lace
               making, and so forth. Fine arts are the splendor of the sister's   437
               religious  life.  Some  of  them  should  know  music,  drawing,
               painting, modeling, poetry, public speaking, and even carving
               marble.  Those  inclined  to  mechanics  are  also  useful  to  the
               houses.  The  sisters  skilled  in  fine  arts  may  teach  the
               students.

                    Education. Please accustom the students to obedience,
               gratitude, mercy on the poor, gentle manners, respect for the
               older,  reverence  toward  the  priests,  respect  in  the  church,
               mutual  love  and  sympathy,  and  forgiveness  of  offences.
               Educate them to escape from idleness, to be modest, to talk
               moderately, and to bridle gluttony.

                    Will  you  receive  the  students  immodestly  dressed?  If
               society  were  modest,  surely  you  should  censure,  exhort,
               correct, and even send them home. If society is easygoing,
               however, you will do your best to repair, for instance]]></page><page Index="438"><![CDATA[by  having  the  students  wear  a  scholar  uniform  provided  by
               the parents. But, if immodesty is ostentatious, the young girl
               must go home.

                    Building.  Rooms  and  educational  facilities  must  be
               maintained in hygienic conditions, ample, airy, and sunny; the
               school  must  also  have  an  open  space  or  garden  for  play
               activity.

                    Rewards.  The  children's  work,  behavior,  kindness,  and
               so forth will be recorded. The best students will be rewarded
               according to their merits with personal prizes, and also with
               vacation trips (S.D.D.Z.). (6)



                              9. TEACHING CATECHISM

                    Teaching Christian doctrine to children is a sublime work
               held  in  great  esteem  by  men  illustrious  for  science  and
               holiness in all times. For instance, St. Jerome often stopped   438
               his  hard  study  on  Holy  Scripture  to  catechize  children.  St.
               Augustine  wrote  two  books  on  Christian  Doctrine  in  high
               style.  Clement  of  Alexandria  and  Cyril  wrote  and  taught
               catechisms.  St.  Gregory  the  Great  taught  children  the
               elements  of  faith  personally,  the  burden  of  his  pontificate
               notwithstanding.  Clement  VlIl  entrusted  the  talented
               Bellarmino with writing an appropriate catechism for children.
               In  France,  Gersone  taught  catechism  to  the  children  on
               holidays,  and  was  praised  by  Benedict  XIV;  Bossuet  and
               Fenelon took up writing minor works. In Italy, towards the end
               of the 19th century, St. Alphonsus M. dei Liguori, renowned
               for  holiness  and  a  doctor  of  the  Church,  wrote  a  small
               catechism for children and he himself sometimes taught them
               in the churches.

                    Such  geniuses  esteemed  this  work  apparently  so
               humble. In fact, what is the Catholic catechism all about? It is
               a summery of the Christian doctrine. Considered in]]></page><page Index="439"><![CDATA[its  dogmas,  Christian  doctrine  is  the best  means  to  elevate
               the human intellect. Considered in its precepts, it is the most
               efficacious means  to  moralize  the  heart.  It  is  not  an earthly
               doctrine, but a heavenly one. It was not a man nor a prophet
               nor a philosopher, but the eternal Word of God, God himself
               that  revealed  it.  The  most  learned  persons  could  never
               imagine  such  a  doctrine...  Made  of  mysteries,  themselves
               obscure, but clear and obvious in their wording, this doctrine
               reveals  where  the  person  comes  from,  who  is  the  Creator,
               which  is  the  creature's  destination.  Consisting  of  principles
               contrary to human passions but consistent with the needs of
               the human heart, this doctrine gives peace to the people by
               making  them  delight  in  the  sweetness  of  true  happiness.  It
               solves  the  greatest  problems  of  human  life,  the  same
               problems on which the most learned persons of Portico and
               Academy struggled hard in vain; the problems which form the
               absurdity  and  the  contradiction  of  the  behind  Alps'  schools,
               because they unbridle reason to the most dreadful frenzies by
               excluding Christ.

                    Teaching catechism is a noble ministry for the doctrine   439
               itself and for charity which makes such a doctrine possible.
               Together with St. Paul we could say that the charity of Christ
               urges us; only charity may induce the Christians to teach the
               rudiments  of  faith to  uncouth  and  ragged  children,  because
               such a work is humble, full of difficulties, and does not attract
               selfishness  by  fostering  the  feeling  of  glory.  The  Christian
               educator who spends his time in a little temple together with
               poor  children  who  are  unable  to  value  his  sacrifices,  must
               arm  himself  with  patience  in  order  to  teach,  and  with
               meekness in order to correct. He has to continuously insist on
               the easiest prayers for months and years without getting tired
               of the humble, assiduous work! So much self-denial is the]]></page><page Index="440"><![CDATA[daughter  of  charity.  It  is  through  charity  that  the  Christian
               loves his neighbor as himself, willing to bestow the treasure
               of his faith on others, to suffer and to bear everything, feeling
               himself rewarded when he succeeds in making a poor child
               know that there is one God who created everything.

                    I know that the world displays the works of philanthropy
               instead  of  the  Catholic  charitable  institutions.  But,  may  we
               compare  them?  Is  it  possible  to  compare  God  with  human
               beings? Philanthropy is pure love of man toward man; charity
               is love of man toward God. Now then, because true love of
               man is impossible without God. Philanthropy does not really
               love  man,  but  pretends  to;  it  is,  therefore,  the  counterfeit
               money  of  charity  in  the  hands  of  those  who,  pose  as  the
               people's benefactors. The philanthropic institutions which are
               supported by a false principle of beneficence or by pride, are
               unfruitful and flail very quickly, because they are not based on
               virtue.  On  the  contrary,  the  charitable  institutions  supported
               by sacrifice and self-denial overcome any difficulty, are very
               fruitful, defy time, and face fortunes.
                                                                         440
                    If we look at the aims of philanthropy and charity, what
               unfathomable differences we see between them! Philanthropy
               aims at the. natural good, which becomes unattainable when
               it  is  separated  from  the  supernatural  one.  Charity  instead
               aims at a divine goal: at forming a human being worth of his
               fate, which implies the good a human being is able to reach in
               the physical intellectual, and moral sphere.

                    You easily perceive that teaching catechism to children
               is a sublime work both for its reason and aim. The aim is the
               eternal salvation of the souls, which brought about the eternal
               Word of God to become a man, to work]]></page><page Index="441"><![CDATA[and to suffer so much. By teaching children the doctrine that
               educates them to avoid evil and to do good, we give them the
               means for their sanctification and eternal salvation. Can you
               show me an aim nobler or more important than this?


               a) Advantages

                    After considering how excellent this work is, we consider
               its advantages.

                    Is  the  Catholic  catechism's  content  an  unfruitful,
               ineffective doctrine, barren of results, or is it a doctrine fecund
               of immense effects and rich with supreme advantages?

                    Look  at  Christianity's  story to  find  the  answer.  You  will
               see  that  this  powerful  doctrine  overcame  the  most
               tremendous difficulties through its apparently weak means. It
               was so fecund of results as to reform entire nations quickly.
               The  apostles  preached  ,it  from  the  threshold  of  the
               supper-room, and thousands of Jews were converted. They   441
               preached it in Thrace and in Scythia, and the untamed people
               were converted. They preached it in India, Ethiopia, Armenia,
               and regenerated the people to a new life. They preached it in
               Rome in the presence of the emperors like Nero, and in spite
               of being persecuted, silenced, and banished in various ways
               this  doctrine  overcame  persecutions,  prevailed  over  the
               tyrants, and exposed the sham of the false gods, raising the
               cross  of  the  divine  teacher on  their  ruins.  Isn't  this  doctrine
               bringing peace in the families by opening the afflicted heart to
               hope,  by  defending  the  rights  of  the  poor,  by  freeing  the
               oppressed  from  'barbarity,  by  breaking  the  blocks  to  the
               prisoners? Even though unknown to so many persons of the
               world, this doctrine helps everyone, even those who do not
               know it! Since it has been taught by the Creator of all things,
               this doctrine is by itself fecund.]]></page><page Index="442"><![CDATA[This  doctrine  has  never  lost  its  divine  efficacy.  Con-
               tinuing through the centuries its great apostolate, the Church
               never stops preaching Christ from generation to generation,
               also teaching the children about God and his Church through
               the Catholic catechism.


               b) Sure advantages

                    Teaching  Catholic  catechism  to  children  brings  about
               certain  advantages  like  the  sowing  of  the  seed  in  a  fertile
               soil.  To  learn  and  profit  by  it,  however,  it  is  indispensable
               that  the  pupil  have  docility  in  receiving  the  lesson  and
               intelligence to understand it.

                    Docility.  Owing  to  his  pure  heart  which  does  not  know
               malice, duplicity and doubts, the child's docility is great. We
               can  tell  you  with  how  much  certainty  children  receive  even
               our mysterious teaching, the one which is unintelligible to the
               human  intellect.  For  instance,  we  say  that  God  is  one  and   442
               triune, that Jesus is in the Eucharist under the form of bread
               and wine, that the whole Jesus is in each host, many as they
               may  be;  they  object  to  nothing,  they  rather  compete  to
               receive  these  truths  as  quickly  as  they  can.  Oh,  children's
               divine  simplicity!  Surely,  they  deserve  the  familiarity  of  the
               celestial  Father,  who  conceals  his  secrets  to  the  great  but
               reveals them to children! How different instead are the hearts
               of the worldly persons! Talk with them of the great mysteries
               of  faith,  and  you  will  see  their  riotous  pride  and  impurity
               forging  a  thousand  sophisms  in  order  to  reject  the  sublime
               truths of the Christian doctrine!

                    Someone  might  put  this  question:  is  a  child  so  devel-
               oped as to understand what you teach?

                    If you talk of the mysteries' contents, the answer is no,
               because no  human  intelligence  is  able  to  understand  them;
               but, if you talk of the formula through which the mysteries and
               the moral truths of divine revelation are]]></page><page Index="443"><![CDATA[expressed, the answer is yes, because nothing is so clear as
               the Christian doctrine. God's word bestows on the people a
               deep  understanding  through  simplicity  of  expression,
               because  God  is  simplest  spirit,  even  though  mysterious  for
               human understanding. He encloses one thousand truths in a
               word  or  in  one  saying,  whereas  human  beings  use  many
               circumlocutions to  express  one  idea.  This  is  the  reason  we
               easily  teach  children  the  summary  of  the  mysteries,  the
               philosophy of all philosophies, the code of all codes, which is
               the Catholic catechism.


               c) For the individuals

                    Which  are  the  certain  advantages  that  children  draw
               from the teaching of Christian doctrine? We aim at teaching
               and educating children, whose advantages are learning and
               education. But the learning I am talking about is different from
               the one of the world. The mundane person considers us as
               ignorant,  because  he  knows  the  secrets  of  electricity  and
               steam;  he  considers  us  reactionary,  but  himself  civilized,   443
               because he has set his mind at rest through duel standards.
               Talking  about  evangelical  learning  and  Christian  .education
               through  which  we  teach  children  their  duties  toward  God,
               neighbor,  and  themselves,  we  educate  them  to  forgive
               insults,  to  obey  their  elders,  and  to  bear  with  each  other
               mutually.  In  short:  we  teach  the  fear  of  God,  which  is  the
               beginning of wisdom.

                    Compared with one of our children, what are the French
               encyclopedists  or  the  modern  rationalists  or  even  the
               philosophers of old, the wise men of Greece, and the learned
               scholars  of  Rome?  When  Jesus  entered  the  temple  of
               Jerusalem  and  met  the  doctors  of  the  law,  he  was  twelve,
               shared the discussion, and prevailed over them. A child who
               knows  the  Christian  doctrine  would  do  the  same  with  the
               worldly wise. He could resolve doubts]]></page><page Index="444"><![CDATA[with  a  word!  He  could  correct  errors,  solve  difficulties,  and
               confute  opinions!  They  should  conclude  by  saying:  we  are
               ignorant; this child is wise!

                    Such  is  the  teaching  and  the  education  we  give  the
               children through the Catholic catechism. But we make it more
               efficacious by combining doctrine with practice, by making the
               children to learn the gospel and to practice it. In the evening
               school  of  the  Christian  doctrine  we  settle  their  quarrels,  we
               correct  their  defects,  we  guide  them  in  the  way  of  honesty
               through  counsels  and  exhortations,  instilling  a  horror  of  sin
               and a love of virtue; we accustom them to pray to Jesus and
               Mary,  to  thank  God  for  his  mercies,  and  to  praise  him  by
               singing devout songs. They begin approaching the sacrament
               of  reconciliation  in  order  to  approach  the  Eucharistic  table
               and  to  feed  on  the  bread  of  the  angels.  Instructed  and
               educated,  they  become  honest  citizens,  industrious  workers
               who  will  not  curse  their  condition,  nor  covet  the  goods  of
               others  through  destruction  and  robbery.  They  will  form  the
               Catholic  people  who  will  maintain  their  faith  even  in  the
               presence of the seduction and the allurement, through which   444
               the mundane persons dupe the crowds to achieve their own
               personal aim.

                    It is true that some of the students who attend Christian
               doctrine  sometimes  abandon  its  celestial  wisdom.  However,
               to  call  back  a  person  on  the  right  path,  nothing  is  more
               efficacious  than  his  Christian  childhood's  memories.  What
               inexpressible memories! Recollection of past happiness is so
               dear to the persons that they feel being born again because
               of it! A person living far from God is unable to be in peace; he
               becomes afflicted, restless, troubled by remorses. But happy
               is he if the recollection of his childhood, nurtured by the word
               of God, will catch him. He will remember the time when he
               with other children]]></page><page Index="445"><![CDATA[learned Hail Mary, when he listened to the speech on Jesus
               Christ crucified, when he burst with joy at the sight of sacred
               figures, when... Oh, human heart is so natured that it lives as
               much on memories as it lives on hope! Just as the prodigal
               son in -his misfortune called to mind the bread he had eaten
               in the house of his father for so long, thus this person who is
               misled,  tossed,  and  afflicted  by  his  own  passions  will  think
               over the divine food he enjoyed in the house of God, and will
               say: «I will get up and go to my Father » (Lk. 15, 18)!


               d) For society

                    Teaching  Christian  doctrine  to  children  brings  about
               universal advantages to the individuals, to the families, and to
               society.

                    Unfortunately, the world mocker has fed the population
               with fateful allurements and bitter disappointments, masking
               its  aims  under  fine  sentences  and  passwords!  The  world
               dares to tempt the people, which is so religious by nature, to   445
               be irreligious, and it succeeds sometimes! But, what happens
               when it succeeds? By taking away religion from the families,
               everything is taken away because religion remedies even the
               want  of  basic  needs,  faith  is  also  bread  giving  life  and
               perseverance  in  work,  patience  in  misfortunes,  order  and
               thrift in the administration of the daily salary.

                    By teaching Christian doctrine we reverse what the world
               does: we help the families to be religious. By instructing and
               educating their children, we win their trust. They look at the
               Catholic priest as at the real minister of the Lord, recommend
               their  children  to  him,  respect  and  revere  him  because  they
               know  that  he  is  moved  by  charity  in  such  a  humble,  but
               important  work.  The  families  send  us  their  children  that  are
               vivacious  and  restless,  and  take  them  home  docile  and
               obedient. The mothers themselves]]></page><page Index="446"><![CDATA[say  that  their  children  become  always  more  docile,  re-
               spectful,,  devout,  and  diligent  at  work  when  they  frequently
               attend the Christian doctrine.

                    The  advantages  of  teaching  Christian  doctrine  go  from
               the families to society, which cannot reach perfection without
               religion. Religious and sociable persons emerge only from the
               Catholic  catechism  school,  where  the  new  generation  is
               trained to live in a Christian manner. There, so many children
               gather  in  one  agreement;  they  feed  on  the  same  wisdom,
               accustom  themselves  to  pray  together,  to  be  religious  and
               devout, and to look at themselves as at the Christian society
               protected  by  the  Catholic  priesthood,  receiving  the  most
               beneficial, ineffaceable impressions.

                    When children mature and meet again in their activities,
               they  will  recognize  themselves  as  brothers  and  sisters  in
               Jesus  Christ,  because  they  learned  the  same  celestial
               wisdom. As a matter of fact, didn't they learn the social rules
               at the same school? There, children are not told that property
               is  a  theft;  on  the  contrary,  they  are  told  that  they  must  not   446
               steal, nor covet the property of others; they are not told that
               equality may be reached by destroying the hierarchy; they are
               not  taught  how  to  throw  down  the  government  and  how  to
               escape from any authority; on the contrary, they are told to
               give  back  to  Caesar  what  belongs  to  Caesar,  and  to  God
               what  belongs  to  God.  In  short,  we  avoid  forming  human
               beings who are contrary to any real society, because we aim
               at forming persons who will comply with their duty by obeying
               divine and human law.

                    Please  consider  how  the  advantages  coming  from
               teaching  Christian  doctrine  go  from  individuals  to  families,
               from families to society, and from generation to generation.]]></page><page Index="447"><![CDATA[Look  at  those  children  who  will  become  fathers  and
               mothers in the near future. They, the new parents, will cope
               with  their  children  as  we  have  done  with  them.  They  will
               educate  their  children  with  the  same  rules  of  the  Catholic
               catechism. They will perhaps see on their grandchildren the
               beneficial fruits of the divine teaching they have received at
               our school; and when helped by the Catholic priesthood that
               watched over their childhood, they will close their eyes to this
               world,  they  will  leave  the  sublime  inheritance  of  faith  to  the
               new generations.

                    Thus, that Hail Mary, that Our Father, that small Catholic
               catechism  we  teach  to  children  becomes  the  real  mustard
               seed which is planted in the pure hearts, which is fostered by
               the  grace  of  the  divine  farmer,  which  develops,  grows,  and
               becomes a  marvelous  tree  (From  the  speech  for  catechism
               reward, Feb. 5, 1878).



                               10. FOREIGN MISSIONS                      447

                      I have started the evening missions in the refectory by
               explaining to the communities the importance of helping the
               work of the foreign missions both by prayer and means. We
               need  to  introduce  this  spirit  of  zeal  in  our  communities,
               because  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  may  want  a  group  of
               Rogationists  and  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  to  go  to  foreign
               missions  in  the  future!  Please  read  to  the  community  the
               mission  pamphlets'  that  I  will  mail  to  you  and  to  the
               Rogationists (Letter to the Mother Superior Nazzarena, May
               25, 1921).

                    Nurture the holy ideal of foreign missions in the infidels'
               lands  such  as  Africa,  China,  Americas,  Oceania,  Indies,
               Russia, etc. Foster the hope of gathering and educating the
               Holy Childhood and the savage children in order to practice
               the works of charity, instruction, and]]></page><page Index="448"><![CDATA[civilization; to make Jesus known and loved by the infidels;
               and to set the slaves free.

                    Only the mission enthusiasts who are firmly resolved to
               face  travels,  inconveniences,  want, and  perils;  who  feel  the
               divine  impulse  to  bear  witness  of  their  love  toward  Jesus
               through martyrdom will be appointed to such an apostolate.

                    May  Jesus  our  supreme  goodness  raise  such  souls
               among  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  and  may  these  gen-
               erous  souls  shed  their  blood  for  the  propagation  of  the
               Catholic faith, for the eternal salvation of the souls and for the
               love of Jesus, who shed his Most Precious Blood for us!
                    From heaven, these elect souls would be the institute's
               pillars  and  the  burning  fire  of  charity  and  zeal  for  the
               Daughters of Divine Zeal on earth (S.D.D.Z.).

               a) Holy Childhood

                    I am mailing these pamphlets of the great, tender Holy
               Childhood to you, who are concerned with holy things and are   448
               increasing  your  desires  for  winning  souls  to  Jesus  Christ!
               That  so  many  children  in  the  savages  and  infidels'  lands
               perish  in  the  streets,  or  at  the  foot  of  the  trees,  or  are
               drowned in the rivers by their cruel parents; that their souls
               fall into Limbo instead of going to heaven, never seeing God,
               make us cry with emotion!

                    But, that hundreds of thousands of souls go straight to
               heaven  when  the  Catholic  world  takes  interest  in  them  by
               giving  generous  alms  to  the  missionaries  fills  our  soul  with
               joy.  They  spread  the  light  of  faith  among  the  cruel,
               superstitious  crowds,  make  them  know  Jesus  Christ,  make
               the  parents  be  kind  with  their  children,  baptize  the  dying,
               snatch  them  even  from  the  mouth  of  the  dogs  or  pigs,  and
               open  for  them  the  doors  of  the  eternal  glory  through  the
               redemptive baptismal water! Who knows how]]></page><page Index="449"><![CDATA[the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  is  delighted  by  so  celestial
               gains? These souls from heaven will repay with their prayer
               the  heroic  missionaries,  the  priests,  the  catechists,  the
               sisters, and the helpers.

                    We  are  giving  our  spiritual  contribution  through  the
               Rogation  by  winning  the  workers  for  the  rich  harvest  of  the
               mystical barns and for the eternal kingdom! But for the sake
               of divine mercy we are also obliged to pledge our monetary
               contributions  for  such  a  holy, marvelous  work!  Isn't  this  the
               best use of the means that St. Anthony lavishes on us? Isn't
               this the best way to please him? The name of Holy Childhood
               is due to the holiness of the work and to its dedication to the
               child  Jesus,  the  most  tender  love  of  the  hearts  which  are
               created to love God, not earthly foolishness! Holy Childhood
               is  entrusted  to  the  child  God!  Please  imagine  how  St.
               Anthony and the child Jesus are pleased by our contributions
               for  the  saviors  of  so  many  souls  that  are  redeemed  by  the
               Most Precious Blood. I am not saying that one of those souls
               is  more  worthy  than  the  cosmos  with  all  its  marvels;  I  am
               saying that one of those souls is worth as much as all souls   449
               together are worthy, is worthy as much as the adorable blood
               of Jesus Christ is worthy; that the entrance of one of those
               souls into heaven cheers the whole paradise, the angels, the
               saints, and, the most holy Virgin who meet and consign that
               soul to the most holy Trinity!

                    Oh,  infinite  mysteries  of  love  revealed  by  faith!  Those
               little  souls  never  offended  God,  never  shared  human
               foolishness, but were created to be saved by the elects who
               had to practice faith, charity, zeal, and other virtues for their
               own salvation!

                    Was our adorable God bound to create us in conditions
               so different from those of the children who are born of savage
               ,parents in corrupted regions? We are born]]></page><page Index="450"><![CDATA[instead  in  the  holy  Church's  womb,  we  are  baptized,
               instructed in the holy religion, guided to the holy altars. We
               are called to the religious life, to the divine service. We are
               supported by so many celestial means for our sanctification!
               And  yet,  we  have  to  love  all  souls  as  much  as  ours
               concerning ourselves with them as with ours. Cod wants it!

                   I am writing these lines to all communities, beginning with
               you who are the chosen seed, (7) our hope, and the favorite
               of Jesus' Heart; (I would say, of my bad heart too)!

                   I am not urging you to contribute to this holy work through
               alms. If you could, you would with great pleasure. I am more
               concerned with fostering charity and zeal for winning souls to
               Jesus,  because  if  you  were  apathetic,  you  were  not
               Rogationists of Jesus' Heart nor Daughters of Divine Zeal...

                   To  associate  you  in  this  tender,  beautiful,  touching
               institution, I mail the Holy Childhood's pamphlets to you. You
               can read all or the best of them as a spiritual reading or in the
               refectory. You will find in my mail figures of the child Jesus   450
               with children of those lands, and many more. I will see to it
               that  the  Holy  Childhood's  pamphlets  be  delivered  to  you
               every  month.  I  bless  you.  Let  us  belong  totally  to  Jesus
               together  with  your  beloved  director,  Canon  Vitale,  and  me,
               who long for so great a fortune (Letter, March 15, 1922).


               b) Preparation to the missions

                   If the Daughters of Divine Zeal long for the holy missions,
               they must have the pure intention of winning souls to our Lord
               Jesus Christ and of  favoring the popes, who earnestly care
               the increasing of the missionaries. The sisters will never long
               the mission for spiritual pride.

                   Were the sisters drawn to the missions by stimulus]]></page><page Index="451"><![CDATA[of ambition and novelty, they wouldn't be able to resist and to
               comply  with  so  high  a  work  of  charity  and  zeal  for  lack  of
               grace,  they  would  instead  slacken,  jeopardizing  their
               perseverance  in  time  of  persecutions.  It  is  necessary,
               therefore, that those who long for the holy missions pray to
               the Lord for enlightenment, for fervor, and for pure intention,
               seeking the glory of God and the good of souls.

                    After  praying,  they  will  submit  their  intention  to  the
               superiors.  The  mother  general  together  with  her  assistants
               will  pray  and  examine  the  request.  When  the  missionary
               candidate's qualities such as: good nature, character, health,
               and  age  give  assurances  for  the  holy  missions,  the  mother
               general will accept the request, and will assign the sister to
               the missionary house for an appropriate preparation.

                    When  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  institute  is  formed
               and holy vocations for missions are ready with God's help, a
               Missionary  House  will  be  formed.  The  candidates  for  the
               missions  will  prepare  themselves  for  the  task  they  will
               undertake  with  the  Lord's  help,  and  with  holy  obedience  to   451
               ecclesiastical  authority  and  their  own  superiors.  They  will
               observe the following topics:

                    1. They will attend to assiduous prayer.
                    2. They will say specific prayers.
                    3.  They  will  practice  penance  and  austerity  in  food,
               schedule,  and  sleep,  sleeping  even  on  the  straw  or  on  the
               ground and making nightly vigils.
                    4. They will catechize children with great zeal and love.
               As good catechists, they will teach the formulas, will explain
               them,  and  will  narrate  some  stories  from  the  Bible  or  from
               illustrated  catechisms,  training  themselves  accurately  in  the
               missionary house.
                    5. They will acquaint themselves with the mission]]></page><page Index="452"><![CDATA[lands, specifically with the lands where they will go such as:
               Africa, China, America, Indies, etc.
                    6. Besides French, teachers and polyglot books will help
               them  learn  the  language  of  the  people  among  whom  they
               have to work.
                    7.  To  foster  the  missionary  spirit,  they  will  read  books
               and magazines from holy missions.
                    8. They will be acquainted with hygiene, medicine, and
               pharmacy. Same sisters should also be graduated, because
               they have to cure the infidels in the missions.
                    9. The mother superiors will provide the candidates for
               the Missions with special lectures.

                    Their training will last two or three years to be ready for
               the new life of sacrifice and apostolate. The missionary house
               will  be  in  a  place  where  spiritual  and  intellectual  help  is
               available.  If  the  institute  has  no  house  for  this  training,  the
               candidates  for  the  holy  missions  will  train  themselves  in  a
               separated section of the institute (S.D.D.Z.).

                                                                         452

                                        NOTES

                   (1)  When the Padre was writing, the Rogationists did not exist.
                   (2)  Let us call  to  mind  one of our  padre's  genial  inventions. He
               wanted  all  the  communities  to  spiritually  share  in  the  Eucharistic
               Congress'   closing,  which  was   celebrated   in   Lourdes   in   1914.
               We quote   from   his   circular   of   July   22,   1914.   After   prescribing
               a Eucharistic   procession,   he   added:   «In   the   solemn   procession
               of Lourdes on 26 instant,  many sick from  various cities  of the world will
               greet  the  most  Holy  Sacrament  from  t  both  sides  of  the  street,
               exclaiming  aloud:  O  Lord  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament,  have  mercy  on
               us,  please  heal  us,  heal    us!  Probably,  sudden  healings  may  happen
               during  the procession  as  it  happened  in  the   past;  thus,   our  Lord
               will renew the miraculous healings he worked in Jerusalem and the cities
               of Judea...]]></page><page Index="453"><![CDATA[Well, we all are sick in the soul more than in the body. We have to
               long  for  healing  the  spiritual  more  than  the  bodily  sickness.  For  that
               reason, several persons will place themselves on the right and the left
               side  of  the  places  through  which  the  Holy  Sacrament  will  pass  in
               procession in our houses. One will represent the Pious Institute of Jesus'
               Heart's interests, and will say: Lord Jesus in the Sacrament, have mercy
               on  me,  please  heal  me,  heal  me!  Two  persons  will  represent  our
               Anthonian  orphanages  for  boys,  and.  will  say:  Lord  Jesus  in  the
               Sacrament, have mercy on us, please heal, heal, heal us.. Two persons
               will represent the male religious communities, and will say: Lord Jesus in
               the Sacrament, have mercy on us, please heal, heal us! One person will
               represent  the  poor,  and  will  say:  Lord  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament,  have
               mercy  on  us,  please  heal,  heal  us.  Another  person  will  represent  the
               absent people who are willing to be represented, and will cry in the same
               way. Then, all the people going in procession will cry: Lord Jesus in the
               Sacrament, have mercy on us, 'please heal, heal us.
                   In the day schools, some of the students standing on the right and
               left side, will represent their fellows and will exclaim as above when the
               procession is passing through.
                   These invocations will be spoken now and then with raised hands,
               in a loud, plaintive voice during the procession, beginning from the time
               it starts. The two rows of the representatives will face each other so that
               the Holy Sacrament will pass through, without interference of the general
               public.                                                   453
                   Each representative may wear a badge with the name of those who
               are  represented  such  as  Pious  Institute  or  Anthonian  Orphanages  or
               Religious Community of the Rogationists.
                   If  the  procession  is  public,  nothing  hinders  this  devout,  effective
               practice from being done. Done with faith, humility and love, it will obtain
               spiritual healing from Jesus in the Sacrament!»
                   (3)  «Please  celebrate  together  with  the   children   the  following
               devotions:    the  most  holy  name  of  Jesus  in  January,  St.  Joseph    in
               March, the most holy Virgin in May, the Sacred Heart of Jesus in June,
               our Lady  of the  Rosary  in  October,   all  souls  in  November. The
               spiritual reading from the best booklets, which will be submitted to  the
               superiors,  will  help you»   (S.D.D.Z.).

                   (5)   «The sisters running the day schools have to  prepare the girls
               for the first Communion with diligent care. They will  instruct the students
               about  this  most admirable Sacrament of  the Eucharist, explaining  and
               making them learn by heart what the catechism says about  it.   If  you
               have    gifted    students,    they      should      be      told      about  the    Old
               Testament's  symbols  concerning  the   most  holy   Eucharist, such as
               the  tree of life in  Eden,  the  manna,  the  bread of  Elijah,]]></page><page Index="454"><![CDATA[and everything we find in the sacred history. They should be told
               about the chief points of the Old and New Testament. Later, the sisters
               will explain the multiplication of the bread by Jesus as a symbol of the
               Eucharist,  and  the  promises Jesus made  in John, chapter  VI. At last,
               they will narrate the Eucharist's institution on Holy Thursday night, at the
               supper.  It  takes  months  to  prepare  the  children  this  way.  By  reading
               some  chapter  of  Practice  to  love  Jesus  Christ  by  St.  Alphonsus  de'
               Liguori, the sisters will excite in the children the wish to receive Jesus in
               the Eucharist. During the preparation, they will lead the children to say
               some wish prayer to our Lord. When the time of the first Communion is
               at hand, the sisters will premise some novena to our Lord, and will help
               the children to offer little sacrifices such as abstaining from drinking or
               fruits or cookies.
                   On the day of the first Communion, the children will be disposed in
               the church under the careful attention of the sisters, who will appear so
               cheered by the holy liturgy as to impress, edify, and foster in the children
               the  wish  to  receive Jesus  in  the  Eucharist.»  After speaking  about  the
               preparation and  the  thanksgiving,  our  padre  adds:  «  1)  It is  helpful  to
               have the day school students in the institute for a three day preparation
               for Holy Communion. 2) The sisters will find ways to make the children
               always  remember  their  first  Communion.  3)  They  will  accustom  the
               children  to  receive  Holy  Communion  once  a  week  with  the  same
               devotion,  recollection,  and  fervor  they  had  in  their  first  Communion;
               preparation  and  thanksgiving  will  be  given  special  attention.  4)  When   454
               following the confessor's counsel fervent children wish to receive  Holy
               Communion more often, the sisters will assist them to receive Jesus with
               increasing  fervor  and devotion.  If children  are deprived of  this  special
               attention, it is better for them to receive the Eucharist every Sunday and
               chief  feasts  after  a  good  preparation,  making  an  appropriate
               thanksgiving as well» (S.D.D.Z.).
                   (6)  Remunerate the work. « The sisters will remember and practice
               the following suggestion. To keep the day school blooming in number,
               care,  and  profit,   the  sisters  must  install  remunerating  works  such
               as selling embroidery and  the   like.  Practically,  the  sisters  will  pay
               the  young  girls half of the sale  income, every  month»   (S.D.D.Z).

                   SACRED HEART-PASSION-INTIMATE SORROWS

                   To  increase  our  zeal  for  the  divine  glory  and  the
               salvation  of  souls,  to  foster  the  understanding  of  our
               mission and carry It out perfectly, our constitutions urge
               us  to  a  particular  devotion  to  the  most  holy  Heart  of
               Jesus and to the mediation on his mysteries of love and
               suffering, especially on his intimate sorrows.
                   I declare that the outstanding devotion of the order
               to the most holy Heart of Jesus is very sweet, gentle, and
               dear to me. I consecrate myself to the adorable Heart and
               to its most holy desires, wishing to promote its interests
               as though they were mine. I will glory in offering myself
               as  a  lover,  son,  slave,  and  victim  of  this  divine  Heart,
               striving  to  make  people  know  and  love  it  all  over  the
               world. But it is in the Eucharistic Communion that I will
               be so close to it as to never be separated from it. I will
               say: « Jesus is mine and I belong to him; I have caught
               him to never loose him. » My duty is to live the life of his   455
               Heart.
                   For that reason I will meditate every day on the mys-
               teries  of  his  life,  Passion,  death,  and  above  all  on  the
               intimate sorrows of the most holy Heart, prolonging the
               meditation when I am able to. Considering his profound,
               hidden torments from the time of his incarnation for all
               sins, for human ingratitude, the failure of elect souls, and
               for  the  eternal  loss  of  many  souls,  I  will  search
               thoroughly    the   most    holy    Heart   of   Jesus'
               Incommensurable  sorrows,  which  surpass  those  of  his
               most  holy  humanity  beyond  any  description,  but  are
               meditated upon by a few people. As for myself, I will feel
               the  divine  Redeemer's  sorrows  in  my  heart  and  will
               contemplate  Jesus  in  the  garden  of  Gethsemane,  as  I
               was deeply sharing in his agony.

                   Because  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary  is  the  only  one
               who penetrated,  knew,  and  shared the  sorrows  and  the
               agony]]></page><page Index="456"><![CDATA[of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  I  will  unite  the  meditation  on
               the Intimate sorrows of the most holy Heart of Jesus with
               the meditation on the Intimate sorrows of the Immaculate
               Heart of Mary.

                    These meditations will give me courage and strength
               for  any  sacrifice,  for  the  greatest  glory  of  God,  for  the
               good of all souls, and for the infinite consolation of the
               most holy Heart of Jesus.


                                1. THE SACRED HEART

                    From  the  beginning  to  the  end,  the  rules  of  this  pious
               institute  demand  that  the  sisters  perform  everything  for  a
               greater consolation of Jesus' Heart. Amen (Oct. 6, 1897).

                    The divine Heart is everything for us: we, the foundation,
               our  poor  work,  the  intentions,  the  houses,  the  orphanages,
               and the schools are consecrated and belong to it. (1) For that   456
               reason the novena and the feast of the Sacred Heart are of
               primary  importance  to  us,  and  we  warmly  recommend  our
               communities  to  celebrate  them  with  a  particular  affection,
               devotion, and transport of love (Letter, May 13, 1913).

                    Rogationists  of  Jesus'  Heart!  I  have  meditated  on  the
               beauty of this name: it means prayer and action. Action also
               includes  the  personal  financial  cooperation  to  continue  our
               work. The specification « of Jesus Heart » crowns everything!

                    This title will form our decorum, our ambition, our honor,
               and the rule of our duties. It makes our devotion to the Heart
               of Jesus very tender, lovable, and delightful; that Heart which
               holds the fortunes of our institute and disposes of them as he
               desires.

                    Let  us  consider  the  divine  Heart's  actions  and  opera-
               tions, what Jesus did and said during his life, and what]]></page><page Index="457"><![CDATA[he  is  doing  in  the  Holy  Sacrament.  When  we  say  Heart  of
               Jesus  we mean  infinite goodness,  love,  charity,  and  mercy.
               Our divine Redeemer is love. Out of love he allowed himself
               to  be  formed  in  Mary's  womb  like  one  of  us  with  a  human
               nature.  Out  of  love  he  cried  in  the  manger,  and  drew  to
               himself the hearts of mankind. Out of love he spoke, prayed,
               hid himself, and worked miracles. In his Passion, out of love
               'he  allowed  people  to  put  him  in  the  press, oppressing  and
               transforming  him  into  the  man  of  suffering.  At  last,  the
               crucified Jesus is the invincible proof of God's love for man.

                    As long as we look at Jesus being formed in his mother's
               womb,  in  the  manger,  in  his  hidden  life,  in  his  Passion,  or
               while  performing  miracles,  we  look  at  the  external
               manifestations  of  his  love.  This,  however,  is  not  the  best
               contemplation. The best contemplation is searching the most
               holy humanity of Jesus, discovering his Heart, because it is in
               his Heart that we find his whole love.

                    In the love of Jesus' Heart we find the characteristics of
               true  love.  True  love  is  strong,  stands  up  against  obstacles.   457
               Love  is  strong  as  death;  love  is  never  jealous...  rude  or
               selfish; love is patient and kind; love is endless. The love of
               Jesus' Heart is strong in his poverty and in his Passion, and
               always magnanimous. Even though Jesus does not need us,
               he faithfully helps us in everything, and when we offend him,
               he waits for us.



                        2. CONSECRATION TO THE SACRED HEART

                    O most charitable Heart of Jesus, we wish you to reign

                             3. A SYMBOLICAL PAINTING
                                                                         458
                    Wishing to put in action an idea of mine (3) in order to
               attract a greater protection of the adorable Heart of Jesus on
               our  institute,  I  have  entrusted  an  artist  of  Toronto  (4)  with
               painting a picture, size cm. 178 x 126, whose photos I am
               mailing  to  each  of  our  houses.  The  original  painting  has
               been  allotted  to  the  mother-house,  the  Holy  Spirit,  in
               Messing.


                    In the photo, the Blessed Margaret Alacoque is kneeling
               on the altar's steps holding in her hands a little picture of the
               Sacred Heart with our divine motto: « Pray, therefore, to the
               owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather
               in  his  harvest.  »  The  Blessed  Margaret  is  giving  a  new
               message  to  the  Catholic  world  by  inviting  the  Visitation
               Daughters to contemplate the Sacred Heart in the painting.
               On the other side of the picture the Daughters of Divine Zeal
               are kneeling, wearing]]></page><page Index="459"><![CDATA[the Heart of Jesus with the Rogate on their chest. The seven
               Visitation Daughters represent the seven novices whom the
               Blessed Margaret inspired with fervor in the  devotion to the
               adorable Heart of Jesus. Now, this devotion is spread in the
               Church. On the other side of the painting seven Daughters of
               Divine Zeal represent their order which shares the love and
               the worship toward the most holy Heart of Jesus. Thus, the
               painting  shows  that  the  divine  Heart  of  Jesus  turned  his
               lowing  attention  to  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  from  the
               beginning, and received their devotion and love together with
               the  love  of  the  Blessed  Margaret  and  her  Daughters.  We
               think that ever since the mast loving Heart of Jesus destined
               to  us  the  command  of  his  Heart's  divine  zeal,  and  com-
               municated this spirit of prayer to his beloved Visitation order.

                    The Holy Sacrament, whence the devotion to the Sacred
               Heart came forth, and where all devotions converge, is on the
               altar. The celestial Rogationist St. Francis de Sales and the
               celestial  Daughter  of  Divine  Zeal  St.  Joan  de  Chantal,
               founders of  the  Visitation order,  kneel  before  the  most holy
               Sacrament,  hinting  at  the  two  communities.  They  seem  to   459
               recommend them  to  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  Imploring
               for the Daughters of Divine Zeal the virtues of the Visitation
               Daughters  such  as:  love  far  the  Sacred  Heart,  humility,
               simplicity,  and  meekness.  They  implore  for  the  Visitation
               Daughters  a  new  flame  and  the  spirit  of  zeal  for  the  divine
               Heart's  greatest  interest,  which  is  enclosed  in  the  divine
               saying: « Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest. »

                    At  the  foot  of  the  Holy  Sacrament,  we  see  the  sacred
               image of Immaculate Mary, who is the real Foundress of the
               Visitation order and the divine mother superior of]]></page><page Index="460"><![CDATA[the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  as  well  as  very  concerned
               protectress of the Evangelical Rogation.

                    At  the  foot  of  the  altar  also  a  priests  is  kneeling  in
               adoration  before  the  Holy  Sacrament,  the  divine  Heart  of
               Jesus, and Immaculate Mary. He could be the Blessed Fr. De
               la  Colombiere,  an  intimate  cooperator  of  the  Blessed
               Margaret  for  the  spreading  of  the  devotion  to  the  adorable
               Heart. But he may represent all the Rogationists, because he
               is praying to the most holy Heart of Jesus to send out good
               workers to the holy Church.

                    It is our hope that the present and future community of
               the Daughters of Divine Zeal grow in the devotion, worship,
               love,  and  zeal  for  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus,  imitate  his
               divine virtues, and go deeply into zeal for the Sacred Heart of
               Jesus, imitate his divine virtues, and go deeply into zeal for
               the  interests  of  the  divine  Rogate.  This  consists  in
               understanding  the  importance  and  efficacy  of  the  divine
               prayer,  the  need  of  the  Church  for  holy  vocations  in  the
               mystical harvest, and the immense utility that the numerous,   460
               holy  Catholic  priests,  the  religious  orders,  and  the  mystical
               workers may bring to the holy Church in the world.

                    For this reason, we wish the Daughters of Divine Zeal to
               make a present, future, and I would also say a past spiritual
               union with the Visitation order, which is so cherished by the
               sweetest Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

                    To more easily reach the goal expressed by the painting,
               please  frame  the  enclosed  photo  and  expose  it  where  the
               community gathers comfortably, but out of the church and of
               the oratory. Every Friday, or at least every first Friday of the
               month, the community will say a prayer before the image of
               the  Sacred  Heart,  invoking  the  Blessed  Margaret's
               intercession.  We  wish  you  to  say  the  litany  of  the  Sacred
               Heart and one Our Father, Hail]]></page><page Index="461"><![CDATA[Mary,  Glory,  and  Hail,  holy  Queen,  to  the most  holy  Virgin,
               concluding  with  the  consecration-prayer  of  the  Blessed
               Margaret  and  with  a  song.  During  the  novena  and  on  the
               feast oaf the most holy Heart of Jesus other prayers will be
               added. On Friday, one Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory will
               be added for the glorification of the Blessed Margaret. (5)

                    I  have  in  mind  to  mail  the  photo  and  the  above
               declaration to Paray-le-Monial Visitation convent and to some
               other  communities  of  the  same  order,  asking  them  for
               affiliation.

                    By so doing and by striving to reach our sanctification in
               perfect  union  with  the  adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  we  expect
               that our least institute will be more pleasing to his sweetest
               Heart! May no one lose holy fervor, the diligent practice of the
               most elect virtues, and the loving attention to please God in
               everything,  but  may  each  one  avoid  sin,  even  in  the  least,
               and  promote  the  interest  of  the  divine  Heart  at  any  cost!
               Please  consider  how,  despite  fights  and  obstacles,  the
               adorable  Heart  of  Jesus  has  formed  and  fulfilled  you  with   461
               spiritual and temporal goods; I would say that with the help of
               his most holy mother, he has been carrying you in his divine
               arms  as  beloved  daughters.  He  has  characterized  you  and
               has  sifted  you  up  to  the  rank  of  spiritual  mothers  of  the
               Catholic  priesthood  with  the  divine  Rogate,  giving  you  an
               exceptional beneficial mission; at last, he has filled you with
               plenty of blessings.

                    How  grateful  you  must  be  and  how  faithfully  you  must

                              4. SPIRITUAL PILGRIMAGE
                              TO PARAY-LE-MONIAL (6)

                    June 8 (1923), Friday, after the octave of Corpus Christi,
               is dedicated to the most holy Heart of Jesus. On this feast,
               the Italian Pilgrimage Committee has planned a pilgrimage to
               Paray-le-Monial, at the fact of the adorable Heart of Jesus.

                    Many people will be fortunate to go there. But everyone
               has the same opportunity to spiritually join the devout pilgrims
               at  the  renowned  sanctuary,  where  our  Lord  showed  his
               sweetest  Heart  to  the  Blessed  Margaret  Alacoque,  making
               her an apostle of the sublime redeeming devotion. The aim of
               such  a  singular  manifestation  in  modern  times  was  not  to
               reach  out  to  Margaret  Alacoque  alone,  but  to  all  souls.  It
               aimed at inspiring with fervor all loving souls, opening to them   462
               new  light,  grace,  and  holiness;  at  cabling  sinners  to
               repentance, saving them from perdition and guiding them to
               eternal life. Jesus continues saying: I did not come to call the
               just, but the sinners.

                    Dearest  children,  we  too  will  spiritually  go  to  Paray-le-
               Monial, which we have been wishing to visit for many years.
               To make our pilgrimage more fervent and acceptable to the
               adorable Heart of Jesus, we have planned the following:
                    1.  On  May  30,  before  the  novena,  we  will  farm  a  little
               procession at six in the morning. While entering the oratory
               for the holy mass, we will sing the song: Pilgrims, come an...;
               (7) then we say the novena and the pilgrimage prayer, as well
               as one Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory]]></page><page Index="463"><![CDATA[to  St.  Francis  de  Sales,  to  St.  Joan  de  Chantal,  and  to  St.
               Margaret Mary;

                    2.  On  June  7,  eve  of  the  feast,  besides  the  morning
               procession, we will have the afternoon procession, 5 to 6;

                    3. To prepare themselves for the feast, the participants
               will receive the sacrament of reconciliation during the novena
               and will practice special virtues and devotions.

                    The aims of the pilgrimage are the following:
                    1.  That  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  free  our  society
               from  spiritual  and  temporal  evils  as  well  as  from  divine
               punishments;
                    2. That the holy Church grow in holiness and freedom;
                    3. That the dissident nations return to the holy Church;
                    4. To save and sanctify the Catholic nations, especially
               Italy and France;
                    5.  That  the  missionary  institutions  flourish  for  the
               salvation of the people who do not know Jesus Christ;
                    6. To dissipate the heresies and the sects which oppose   463
               the holy Church and the divine truths;
                    7.  For  the  Holy  Father,  for  his  freedom,  and  for  the
               freedom of his successors until the end of the world; (8)
                    8.  For  the  souls  in  purgatory,  especially  those  we  are
               bound in duty to remember;
                    9. For the clergy, that they may flourish in holiness and
               knowledge;
                    10.  Each  person  may  add  his  own  intention  (From  the
               circular).



                           5. MEDITATION ON THE PASSION

                    The novices will train themselves in the practice of holy
                meditation... Without adhering strictly to a topic,]]></page><page Index="464"><![CDATA[they will meditate on the mysteries to which they feel drawn,
               giving  the  preference  to  God's  greatness  and  his  divine
               attributes, to the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the
               Holy  Sacrament.  While meditating  on  the  Passion,  they  will
               pay their loving attention to the intimate, ineffable sorrows of
               the Sacred Heart of Jesus (R.L.P.). (9)

                    The morning meditation will be entirely on the most holy
               Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. The meditation book should
               be touching and illuminating as, for instance, « The School of
               the Passionate Jesus » by venerable Thomas of Jesus. Do
               not change the meditation book frequently; when you find that
               one is effective, repeat it several times, because you will not
               lose holy impressions and loving feelings by repeating. It may
               happen  in  profane  readings,  but  usually  not  in  the  spiritual
               ones  concerning  the  mysteries  of  our  faith.  The  more  you
               read  these  books  with  devotion,  the  more  you  are
               enlightened,  the  more  deeply  impressed  you  grow  in  the
               knowledge of God. The mysteries of our faith are a mine of
               infinite wisdom, which can be meditated upon for centuries.
                                                                         464
                    As for the adorable Lord Jesus Christ and his mysteries,
               such  as:  the  incarnation,  Christmas,  his  divine  infancy,  his
               hidden life, his public ministry, and especially his most holy
               Passion and death on the cross and the most holy Eucharist,
               they  form  the  infinite  abyss  about  which  the  Apostle  Paul
               wrote: « How long and broad and high and deep is Christ's
               love! » (Eph. 3, 18). The more the soul meditates with love,
               humility,  and  purity  on  Jesus  Christ  and  his  mysteries,
               especially the ineffable mystery of his Passion - even with the
               same  book  and  the  same  words  -  the  more  the  soul
               experiences the intimate, sorrowful, and loving impression of
               our divine Savior's limitless pain and love. The mare the soul
               discovers the hidden mysteries of that divine love, the more it
               is]]></page><page Index="465"><![CDATA[caught  (10)  by  the  wounds  of  the  most  holy  humanity  of
               Jesus tortured and bleeding. In union with the divine soul and
               the most loving Heart of Jesus, the faithful will expatiate in the
               limitless abyss of charity that made the Son of God a man,
               who  was  immolated  for  the  Father's  glory  and  for  the
               salvation of souls.

                    These  inevitable  results  will  be  achieved by  those  who
               meditate  with  faith  and  love on  the  divine  Savior's  ineffable
               suffering. Therefore, we exhort our children in Jesus Christ to
               never  neglect  the  meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our  Lord,
               because  it  produces  immense  fruits  to  the  souls  who  are
               favorably  disposed.  The  daily,  continuous,  constant
               meditation produces love for Jesus, our supreme goodness,
               'hate  of  the  present,  past,  and  future  sins,  and  strengthens
               one  in  holy  detachment,  desire  to  be  united  with  God,  holy
               virtues, and charity toward the afflicted and the suffering. We
               must always keep in mind that meditation on our Lord Jesus
               Christ's Passion is a necessary, very happy condition for the
               soul to approach the sacred table with compunction, fervor,
               and a profitable love, because the Passion and the Eucharist   465
               cannot  be  separated.  Our  Lord  said  that  the  most  holy
               Eucharist  is  the  memorial  of  his  Passion  and  death.  It  is
               during the mass that the sacrifice of Calvary is renewed mys-
               tically, but really, and Jesus comes down from heaven at the
               consecration  of  the  bread  to  feed  his  dear  souls  with  his
               immaculate body and his most precious blood.

                    Preparation for meditation on the most holy Passion of
               our  Lord  ought  to  be  each  one's  immediate  preparation  for
               Holy Communion. During the meditation the angels will clothe
               the  soul  in  the  wedding  dress  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's
               infinite merits to share in the great supper. The sister will be

                             6. THE INTIMATE SORROWS

                   The meditation on the intimate sorrows of the most holy
               Heart of Jesus is of a great importance far the Daughters of
               Divine Zeal. During his life - the nine months in his mother's
               womb included - Jesus suffered in his divine Heart an abyss
               of interior sorrows so intense that he could have died at any
               moment  of  pure  pain  if  his  divine  omnipotence  had  not
               maintained  his  life  up  to  the  last  moment.  The  prophets
               announced  beforehand  such  a  suffering  through  expressive
               terms and images. The most bitter waters that flooded Jesus   466
               Christ's  most  holy  soul  derived  from  several  sources.
               According to the revelation granted to the Blessed Villani, the
               main sources were: 1) The sight of all sins that Jesus took on
               himself as if he were responsible for them in the 'eyes of his
               Father's  justice.  2)  Human  ingratitude  for  his  love  and
               suffering, of which the prophet David had said: « What has
               the shedding of my blood gained? » 3) The sight of so many
               souls who are lost eternally, which made him say through the
               mouth of the prophet: « The pains of hell surrounded me! » 4)
               The  fearful  sight  of  his  coming  Passion  and  death,  which
               were always present in his mind through the divine vision in
               such a way that he suffered them all his life. To these sorrows
               that  oppressed  his  divine  Heart  other  sorrows  were  joined,
               such as: the]]></page><page Index="467"><![CDATA[sight  of  his  most  holy  Mother's  sorrows,  the  Queen  of
               Martyrs, who was the only one able to penetrate in depth the
               abyss of his intimate sorrows: the sorrows and the torments
               that  the  elects  on  earth  and  in  purgatory  had  to  suffer  the
               ingratitude, ruin, and dispersion of his beloved people Israel;
               the  ingratitude,  obstinacy,  and  loss  of  Judas,  and  so  many
               other causes which oppressed the Heart of Jesus!

                    Our Lord somehow showed his divine Heart's abyss of
               anguish in the garden, where he sweats drops of blood on the
               ground.  He  suffered  this  inexpressible  agony  up  to  Calvary
               and  his  last  breath.  This  intimate  Passion  of  Jesus'  Heart,
               called  also  mental  pains  in  the  revelation  to  the  Blessed
               Villani, surpasses the hardships, the pains, and the torments
               that Jesus suffered in his most holy humanity.

                    The loving Daughters of Divine Zeal must never neglect
               the meditation on the intimate sorrows of the divine Heart of
               Jesus. Each sister will go  deeply into them, will sympathize
               with  the  most  loving  Heart  of  Jesus  so  suffering,  and  will
               become  inflamed  with  zeal  and  fervor  to  console  him,  as   467
               much  as  she  can,  through  her  own  sanctification  and  the
               salvation of souls. She will be zealous to win from the most
               holy  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary  elect  ministers,  apostles  of
               faith and charity, holy souls in all social classes so that the
               kingdom of God may be spread on the ruin of the kingdom of
               sin, and the adorable Heart of Jesus may be assuaged and
               infinitely consoled (S.D.D.Z.).

                    The  novices  will  meditate  on  and  pray  for  a  particular
               topic, which forms the special character of this humble, small
               institute,  considering  it  as  a  special  gift  of  the  Lord.
               Specifically, they will meditate on the Passion that the Heart
               of Jesus suffered in his innermost, which is little]]></page><page Index="468"><![CDATA[considered and quite unknown, but was more painful than the
               Passion Jesus suffered in his most holy body. This Passion
               includes the intimate, ineffable sorrows and sadness that our
               divine Redeemer felt in his Heart, all his life long. Beginning
               with his first heart-beat until his last one, the adorable Heart
               suffered and agonized bath at the sight of all sins that he was
               going  to  expiate,  and  whose  malice  and  horror  he  knew
               perfectly, and at the sight of all human ingratitude and of the
               eternal loss of so many souls! Going deeply into this singular,
               ceaseless,  inexpressible  suffering of  the  most  holy  Heart  of
               Jesus is a great gift and mercy of God, who moves the soul to
               a  great  compassion,  gratitude,  and  love.  This  institute's
               particular  spirit,  which  conforms  to  the  saying  of  our  Lord
               Jesus Christ, « Pray, therefore, » is bound to the meditation
               on the intimate sorrows of Jesus' Heart. By going deeply in
               these  sorrows  the  congregants  cannot  be  apathetic  before
               the interests of the divine Heart. They instead feel and share
               them,  and  are  moved  to  sacrifice  themselves  for  the  divine
               .interests.  The  divine  saying  resounds  to  their  ears  and
               makes  them  obey  that  command  to  console  the  most  holy
               Heart of Jesus in his sorrows. This prayer aims directly at the   468
               greater glory of God and at the sanctification of souls in the
               interests of the most holy Heart of Jesus (R.N.).



                              7. OUR LADY IN SORROW

                    Daughters, behold our most holy mother full of sorrows
               and anguishes. Let us stop contemplating her in the kingdom
               of glory, where she is sharing the same joy of the most holy
               Trinity  at  the  right  hand  of  her  divine  Son,  but  let  us
               contemplate  her  in  the  kingdom  of  affliction,  where  she
               shared the pains of her divine son Jesus.]]></page><page Index="469"><![CDATA[She is the queen of heaven and earth as well as the queen of
               martyrs. Just as she surpasses the angels and the saints in
               holiness and dignity, so she surpasses the sufferers and the
               martyrs in sorrows.

                    With the Lord's help, in heaven we will enjoy the glory of
               Jesus and Mary, seeing them face to face; but in this valley of
               tears,  we  have  to  shed  our  tears  with  Jesus  and  Mary;  we
               have  to  contemplate  their  suffering,  relating  to  our  Lady  in
               sorrow  our  devotion  to  her  under  any  title.  In  any  image of
               Mary we have to see Our Lady in sorrow! If we look at the
               Virgin in sorrow, we cannot be apathetic! Please observe her
               pale and pitiful face, her anguish of heart, the seven swords,
               the violet cloak... she seems to say: « Daughters, sympathize
               with  me,  because  I  am  the  most  afflicted  mother  »
               (Preaching, Sept. 28, 1913).



                                  8. THE DESOLATE
                                                                         469
                    « All you who pass this way, look and see. Is any sorrow
               like the sorrow that afflicts me, with which Yahweh has struck
               me on the day of his burning anger » (Lam. 1, 12)?

                    The  holy  Church  and  the  sacred  writers  often  apply  to
               Our Lady in sorrow these words that the plaintive Jeremiah
               said  on  the  ruin  of  Jerusalem  conquered  and  reduced  to
               extreme desolation by the enemies. The sight of the desolate
               Jerusalem  was  a  pale  figure  of  the  true  Daughter  of  Zion,
               Immaculate  Virgin  Mary,  in  her  incomparable  desolation  for
               the death of her only son Jesus...

                    The  most  august  lady  was  first  afflicted,  then  went
               through desolation; for this reason we contemplate Our Lady
               in sorrow and Our Lady Desolate. When Our Lady is suffering
               together with her son Jesus, she shares his]]></page><page Index="470"><![CDATA[pains, his bitter cup, she is in sorrow. When Jesus dies, she
               becomes desolate, and the cup of her sorrows reaches the
               brim, overflowing.

                    My faithful, what mysteries! I see Our Lady in sorrow in
               each pain of our Lord Jesus Christ. I see her in the Passion
               as  plunged  into  all  pains  together  with  Jesus!  But,  in  her
               desolation she suffers without Jesus! I see the wounds of her
               heart  opening  again,  but  Jesus  Is  not  with  her!  I  see  her
               scourged by the painful memories, but Jesus is not with her! I
               see her crucified in 'her heart and mind, where the nails are
               deeply driven in, but Jesus is not with her! She can cry out, «
               the light of my eyes itself has left me » (Ps. 38, 10).

                    This is worth our consideration! Just as in the human fall,
               sin  began  with  a  woman,  so  in  the  work  of  human
               redemption,  atonement  had  to  end  with  a  woman!  «  Jesus
               bowed his head and died » (Jn. 19, 30). In that moment his
               pain  ended:  Jesus,  the  man  of  suffering,  stopped  suffering.
               But,  the  partner  of  his  suffering,  the  co-redeemer  of
               humankind did not stop suffering. Rather she entered a more   470
               bitter, ample, deep, stormy sea of anguishes: she entered the
               endless sea of desolation!...

                    The  devotion  to  the  most  holy  Mary  Desolate  is  most
               moving and tender. It is an expression of the innermost, filial
               affection toward the most holy Virgin Mother of God and ours.
               This  devotion  consists  in  keeping  company with  the Mother
               Desolate  from  the  time  the  body  of  Jesus  is  buried  until
               Easter dawn, when our Lord Jesus Christ rises from the dead
               and  appears  to  his  most  holy  mother.  It  is  a  period  of  36
               hours. If in our human fragility we cannot keep company with
               the  Mother  Desolate  for  36  hours,  at  least  let  us  keep  her
               company in these very painful hours when she has lost her
               divine son.

                    When Martha and Magdalene lost Lazarus, many]]></page><page Index="471"><![CDATA[people  went  to  them  to  sympathize.  But,  here  is  the  Virgin
               Mary,  who  is  greater  than  Martha  and  Magdalene;  she has
               lost  one  who  is  greater  than  Lazarus;  she  has  lost  the  one
               who raised Lazarus from the grave by a word; she has lost
               not a brother, but her only son, the Son of God! Let us go and
               sympathize  with  her.  This  devotion  began  with  the  pious
               women who remained with the desolate lady after the death
               of our Lord Jesus Christ. How those spiritual daughters of the
               Nazarene mourned together with the Virgin Mary! How they
               were united in sharing the desolation of her motherly heart!
               St. Bernard says: « They saw the pious Mother lacking any
               relief,  so  they  mourned  more  for  her  than  for  the Lord  who
               had died » (Preaching on the Desolate, 1904)!

                   (1)  Padre  Oi  Francia  consecrated  the  Institute  to  the  most  holy
               Heart  of  Jesus  more  than  once.  Here  we  quote  a  passage  from  the
               consecration he made in 1903:  « O most sacred Heart of Jesus... we
               present the fortunes of this least institute along with its events, works,   471

                   (2) To please and to help the readers, we report two prayers that
               Padre Di Francia wrote to the Sacred Heart to obtain his divine love and
               holy virtues:
                   1)    «O     my    Lord's    most    loving     Heart,     I    appeal     and
               surrender myself to you confidently... I am at your divine will's disposal;
               O my Jesus, see to it that I serve you faithfully.  Please make  me fit for   472
               your divine   service by giving   me    holy virtues,    especially    humility,
               obedience,  and  holy  detachment  from  terrestrial  things.  Give  me  holy
               fear of you, your love,  and  a  great  wish  to sanctify myself  in  order  to
               belong  to  you  totally.  O  my  Jesus,  help  me  to  be  recollected  in  your
               divine presence when  I  pray. — Mother Mary,  let me  belong to Jesus
               completely.
                   2)   Humblest Heart,  remove the  pride  from our  hearts  and fill
               them  up with  holy  humility and  affection  to  it.  O  meekest  Heart,
               quench the irascibility of our heart by making us mild, serene, and calm.
               Immaculate  Heart,   candor of eternal  light,  do  not  allow  our mind to
               be darkened nor our  hearts to be  tarnished  by even the least sin. You
               who  cherish  the  lilies,  make  us  worthy  of  our  angelical  ministry!  As
               clerics, infuse in our heart the zeal for your glory and for the salvation of
               souls. Let us share your zeal for God and your thirst for souls!... Jesus,
               pleasure of the souls, give  us  your  holy love...   wound   our   heart!
               Let   us   love   you   by   making   ourselves enamored  of you. O
               beloved  Jesus,  how can we lead  the  people to know and love you. if
               you do not yet enkindle in us the fire of your love? How can we  become
               the light of  the world,  if you do not enkindle in us your love? How can
               we be the salt of the earth,]]></page><page Index="473"><![CDATA[if you do not transform us into yourself out of love?... Please give us
               your love along with the most beautiful love of Immaculate Mother Mary!

               one of the best. He mailed a printed circular to the houses, explaining
               the  various    intentions:    adoration,  praise,    thanksgiving,  atonement,
               prayer for the Church's triumph, for the salvation of the souls, for winning
               good workers to the Church, for the missions, etc... spiritually they would
               remain at Paray for 5 days.
                   They had to spend those days honoring the Sacred Heart of Jesus
               with special visits, songs,  sacrifices, etc.; from  there  they  would go to
               Lourdes,  where  the  Italian  pilgrimage  went  every  year.  Much  to-  the
               satisfaction  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus,  this  spiritual  journey  had   473
               wonderful effects. (Fr. Mary Hannibal Di Francia — his life and works —
               pages 299-300).
                   In those days we had to spiritually visit the novitiate, where Jesus'
               Heart had the first worshipers, the choir where the community honored
               the Sacred Heart for the first time, the niche built on the novitiate's stairs,
               the first little temple dedicated to the Sacred Heart in the monastery's
               garden  at  the  beginning  of  1687,  and  the  human  remains  of  St.
               Margaret.  Everything  was  accompanied  by  particular  prayers,  pious
               practices, and spiritual reading mostly from St. Margaret's writings.
                   (7)  Please hear the padre's heart's desire in these stanzas:
                   No mountain,  no sea,
                   No obstacle whatsoever
                   Is able to flee
                   The trip of our love!
                   We are carried by the Heart,
                   The Heart of his love.
                   No hunger,  no pain,
                   No thirst exhaust us.
                   Our hunger is God,]]></page><page Index="474"><![CDATA[Our thirst is Jesus. Take care, never stop. Hasten to Jesus!
                   (8)  Remember that the Holy Father recovered freedom  through the
               concordat  of  Feb.  11,  1929.  In  1923  the  concordat  seemed  to  be
               impossible.
                   (9)    They      will      take      care      of      three      things:      affections,
               prayers,  and  resolves.  As  to  affection,  they  will    prefer  acts  of  love
               towards Jesus,   offering  themselves   along  with  their  wishes  for  the
               divine glory,  for  their  sanctification,  for  the  sanctification  of   souls,
               and  for  everything  concerning  Jesus'  Heart's  interests.  As  for  the
               prayers, they will always ask for the love for Jesus, holy perseverance,
               virtues, and  help to observe the rules.  They will  pray for the  interests
               of Jesus' Heart, that the owner of the harvest send out workers to his
               harvest,  for  the  needs  of  the  holy    Church    and    the  ecclesiastical
               superiors, for the  innocent, for the conversion of sinners,   and  for all
               souls. They will pray for their sisters, the mother superior, and the pious
               institute to grow in the most holy Heart of Jesus. They may also pray for
               the  writer  of  these  rules.  As  to  the  resolves,  they  have  to  prepare
               themselves  for  the  daily  occurrences,  promising  to  avoid  their  usual
               defects  and  to  practice  the  virtues  they  need,  especially  the      exact
               execution   of   their   office,   silence,   and   good   example. They must
               consider how  much  God  is  pleased  by  faithfulness  in the little things!
               Through prayer and firm resolve, they will accustom themselves to be
               faithful»   (R.L.P.).
                   (10)   See   how   our   Padre   meditates   on   the   loving   plans     474
               of Jesus   in   his   Passion:    «Jesus   wanted   to   diversify   his
               Passion's mystery so that you  might find every sort of nourishment in
               each  of  his  torments.  If  you  do  not  surrender  to  the  first  torment,  for
               instance,  to  the  agony  in  the  garden,  he  submits  his  cruel  capture  to
               you.   If  you   resist,   he   takes  you   to   the   tribunal,   making   you
               ponder  how  his  most  venerable,  majestic  person  was  outraged  with
               blows, slaps, fists, spittle... But, if you are hard and still  resist, he shows
               to you his dreadful scourging, his most delicate flesh mercilessly torn for
               your sake, to win your heart. And yet, he is eternal, infinite, omnipotent
               God,  the king and the Lord of heaven and earth, while you are nothing,
               a pitiable small worm! To be happy for ever, did
                   'he need you? But, if you will resist and do not surrender to his love,
               he chooses another more terrible suffering to convince and move you to
               repentance and love; such a suffering is the crowning with thorns, whose
               inconceivable pains are renewed by the executioners every time they hit
               the crown. The more the dreadful thorny crown is driven in the head, the
               more  the  pains  become  horrible!  Which  thorn  will  pierce  your  heart?
               Which  of  the  torments  that  Jesus  endured  for  you,  will  make  you
               surrender?]]></page><page Index="475"><![CDATA[If you did not yet surrender, Jesus will undergo new torments. He
               lets  the  authority  condemn  him  to  the  capital  punishment  of  the
               criminals, who are to be taken out of society to protect it. Let us suppose
               that at this point your cold heart starts being touched. Your Jesus takes
               courage  to  conquer  you.  He  embraces  the  cross  with  a  joyous  heart,
               wearing  the  crown  of  his  love  to  really  become spouse of  blood,  and
               starts going to the Calvary in the hope that you will follow him.
                   To win and make you belong to him entirely, in this painful way he
               undergoes  various  pains,  such  as:  falls,  meeting  with  his  most  holy
               mother, the choice of the Cyrenaic, the plaintive mourning of the women
               to whom he wants you to join, the stamp of his bloody, unrecognizable
               face  on  Veronica's  veil,  and  the  incredible  cruelty  of  the  executioners
               who  drag  him.  In  his  pains,  he  looks  at  you  through  the  centuries;
               because  you  are  weak  in  loving  him,  he  calls  you  to  watch  the  last
               terrifying event of his life: the crucifixion and the three hours of agony.
               He assails your heart to win it to his love. His wounds are arrows, his
               adorable blood a besieging fire, his divine words thunder apt to shake
               the mountains, his dying looks that watch you through the centuries are
               lightnings even on the darkness of hell; the least motions and the painful
               contractions  of  his  most  holy  members  on  the  cross  are  most  loving
               calls; the giving of his most holy mother to you as your mother and his
               saying « I am thirsty,» are stratagems to win you; the abandonment by
               all, even by his eternal Father, aims at touching you in order to surrender
               to  his  love  completely,  to  leave  worldly  matters,  your  will,  and  your   475
               judgment that oppose his pure love. It also aims at making you abandon
               yourself  to  his  adorable  will.  This  is  the  last  stroke  at  your  heart's
               hardness.
                   At the end, he cried out: «It is finished!» This cry has two meanings
               for you.
                   To much satisfaction of his Heart, by crying < it is finished» Jesus
               could mean: I have won my beloved's heart; I have guided her through
               the  incredible  pains  that  I  have  conceived  and  chosen  to  make  her
               surrender,  which  she  did  by  leaving  everything,  even  herself;  she
               repressed her passions by washing herself in my blood; she is mine for
               ever.
                   God forbid that by crying «it is finished * Jesus might have meant: I
               have done all I could to win her to my love, I have undergone incredibile
               pains  to  win  her,  but  she  resisted  me  until  the  end!  She  seemed  to
               surrender in the presence of new pains and of the sweetest voice of my
               loving, suffering heart, but she did not. She followed her passions, the
               world, and my enemy's cheating voice. I have nothing more to do. « It is
               finished!»
                   And yet, as though Jesus wanted to make his last effort to win your
               unfaithfulness and hardness, he almost gathers all his]]></page><page Index="476"><![CDATA[pains. Passion and death; he gathers his loving stratagems to give
               you the finishing blow. While the sky is darkening, the earth is trembling,
               the  nature  is  terrified,  mourning  for  your  hardness  and  unfaithfulness,
               Jesus opens his most holy mouth, cries qut in a loud agonizing voice,
               and makes all  the people  hear it during  the  centuries until  the  end of
               time. This is the last stratagem to win you to his most loving Heart. Then
               he  joins  his  cry  with  the  following  words:  «Father,  into  your  hands  I
               commend my spirit!» Just as he had said: Father, my spirit of love and
               charity  for  each  person,  for  the  sanctification  and  for  the  salvation  of
               each soul is also for that soul (Jesus was talking of you). I put my spirit
               in your divine, merciful hands so that my pains and my precious blood
               may  always  invoke  mercy  on  that  hard,  unfaithful  soul.  In  my  divine
               mind, I was unable to conceive a torment apt to win her to my Heart as
               my  beloved  bride  and  Daughter  of  Divine  Zeal!  Father,  through  your
               divine  power  see  to  it  that  my  suffering  and  blood,  my  Passion  and
               death, my body, blood, soul, and divinity that I give her in the Eucharist
               may win her completely. Father, do not stop this work, because my spirit
               of eternal charity always implores mercy on this person you created, and
               for whom I gave myself. My spirit cannot find rest in your hands until she
               breathes her last!
                   I  leave  these  considerations,  which  conform  to  the  truth  and  are
               perhaps inspired by the Lord, to my beloved Daughters of Divine Zeal so
               that  they  meditate  on  the  Passion  and  death  of  our  most  loving  Lord
               Jesus Christ* (S.D.D.Z.).                                 476]]></page><page Index="477"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXIV

                                     THE STUDY

                   To help the institute and souls as much as I can in
               my priestly ministry, I will love and cultivate study.

                    Besides  applying  myself  to  the  study  of  moral
               theology, dogma, canon law, ascetism, the mystics, and
               to my favorite Holy Scripture, I will also devote myself to
               sound readings such as: the holy Fathers, the saints, the
               sacred  authors,  and  ecclesiastical  history,  avoiding  the
               study à la moderne which lacks spirit.

                   For the glory of God and the salvation of souls, I will
               apply myself to study with the utmost care, aiming at pre-
               paring  myself  for  the  priestly  ministry  of  confessions,
               preaching, and teaching, always bearing in mind the Holy
               Spirit's sayings: « knowledge puffs one up » (1 Cor. 8, 1),
               and « be modest in your thinking » (Rom. 12, 3).
                                                                         477
                   If I happen to study profane science or letters, I will
               do  it  by  holy  obedience  for  the  glory  of  God  and  the
               salvation of souls, avoiding to apply myself in them with
               passion lest I loose fervor or the application to the study
               of the saints' wisdom and knowledge.

                   If by the Lord's grace I am inclined to fine arts, I will
               apply myself to them by obedience for the glory of God,
               for  the  good  of  souls and  of  the  institute,  because fine
               arts are gifts of the Lord, which may achieve holy aims.
               We, however, will give a strict account of them to Him.]]></page><page Index="478"><![CDATA[1. FOR THE PRIESTS

                    The  aspirant  will  consider  study  both  as  a  means
               qualifying for the priesthood, if the grace of the Lord and holy
               obedience call for it, as well as a duty and a command from
               the superiors; therefore, he will take the utmost care to profit
               by it, because an aspirant who is slothful to study shows no
               vocation for the priesthood. After invoking the Lord, the most
               holy  Virgin,  and  the  guardian  angel,  the  aspirants  will
               concentrate  their  attention  on  the  study  at  hand,  applying
               themselves to it in perfect silence (R.A.).

                    What  is  the  priesthood  all  about?  It  is  the  light  of  the
               world,  the  mysterious  lantern  lit  on  the  bushel,  whence  it
               gushes out flashes of light to clear away the darkness of the
               earth,  pointing  the  way  to  heaven.  This  mystical  light  must
               illuminate people with the rays of science and of holiness.

                    As to science, we premise that the priest is a minister of
               God, a distributor of his mysteries to the people, a salvation
               bridge  between  heaven  and  earth,  a  mediator  between  the   478
               Creator  and  the  creature;  therefore  his  science  must  be
               drawn  from  the  pure  sources  of  the  truth,  from  the  eternal
               principles of God, of his attributes, mysteries, and law. This
               eminent science is theology. The priest must be full of it. If he
               enriched his mind with other sciences but this one, he would
               fail  his  mission.  He  might  be  a  scholar,  a  philosopher,  a
               mathematician,  but  if  he  lacks  theology,  he  has  failed  his
               sacred duty.

                    Theology is a vast science about God and dogmas, as
               well  as  the  application  of  divine  law  in  human  life,  and  the
               worship we owe to God; hence the triple distinction between
               dogmatic, moral, and canon theology. The priest is called into
               this field to know God and to lead the people]]></page><page Index="479"><![CDATA[to  know  and  to  worship  him  (Funeral  oration  on  Canon
               Ardoino).



                                 2. FOR THE SISTERS

                    To  form  the  sisters  is  a  very  hard  enterprise  for  me,
               because  I  imagine  the  modern  sisters  in  a  very  high  ideal!
               The sister is not closed between four walls today. She is in
               the midst of society to cope with a censorious, mocking, and
               miscreant world. She must honor her garb with virtues such
               as:  modesty,  prudence,  charity  as  well  as  with  intelligence
               and knowledge (Speech, August 20, 1906). (1)

                    The  sisters  will  provide  themselves  with  proper  edu-
               cation,  and  some  of  them  will  acquire  the  credentials
               necessary for teaching the orphans. The candidates and the
               probationers  who  are  inclined  to  literature  will  attend
               advanced courses upon the subject (R.L.P.). (2)
                                                                         479
                    We  entreat  the  mother  superiors,  and  above  all  the
               mother general, to foster diversified education in each house.
               The  first  education  must  be  the  religious  education  through
               the continuous teaching of the little catechism, the illustrated
               catechisms,  the  summary  of  dogmatic  theology,  and  the
               school of sacred, ecclesiastical history.

                    Such  courses  of  four  to  five  years  with  good  teachers,
               mature  prudent  pious  priests,  and  a  board  of  examiners
               should  be  agreed  upon  with  the  bishop.  The  sisters  would
               receive the diploma at the end of the course, after appropriate
               exams.

                    The  advantages  of  these  courses  would  be  great,
               because  the  sisters  would  teach  religion  to  many  young
               women in the day schools, in the boarding schools and]]></page><page Index="480"><![CDATA[in the colleges. They would also teach in our  institutes, and
               the  spreading  of  their  teaching  would  create  a  special
               reputation for the Daughters of Divine Zeal. Oh, how pleased
               our  Lord  would  be  by  this  instruction!  If  religious  education
               does not matter to the government, it matters very much to us
               and to each religious community!

                    The  mother  superior  will  also  foster  literary  education,
               which helps the minds to open and qualify young women for
               our  offices,  for  our  typographies,  and  for  administration.
               Regarding  the  credentials  for  teaching,  we  need  sisters
               qualified  for  the  day  and  the  boarding  elementary  schools,
               and  for  the  orphans  as  well.  Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to
               foster these courses.

                    If we have smart students with the opportunity to attend
               the universities, we should encourage them. They could help
               other  sisters  to  obtain  teaching  credentials,  to  form  a
               boarding  school  recognized  by  the  government.  Teaching
               many young women would be a great good, which would help
               the institution of the Daughters of Divine Zeal.          480

                    Those responsible for the studies will accept wholesome
               young  girls  of  twelve  years  who  show  signs  of  vocation,  to
               lead them to the study. Because they are young, they shave
               the potential to achieve good results (S.D.D.Z.). (3)

                    The mother general, who enjoys fostering the progress
               of the institute for the Lord's glory and the good of souls, will
               foster the fine arts. These form virtue and the splendor of the
               garb, since they raise the admiration of the world and attract
               people to the good. A prophet says that the fine arts are the «
               Strings of Adam » because they unite the heart to truth and to
               goodness.  By  altering  the  nature  of  the  fine  arts  and  by
               conforming them to human passions, the world drags souls to
               vice]]></page><page Index="481"><![CDATA[and  perdition;  we  instead  must use  them  to  entice  souls  to
               holiness.

                    With regard to the fine arts, those who are not inclined to
               them  should  not  be  expected  to  apply  themselves  to  them.
               Frankly,  many  people  have  natural  dispositions  to  the  fine
               arts  without  realizing  it.  If  they  cultivate  those  dispositions
               with  good  teachers  and  with  practice,  they  might  become
               excellent artists.

                    The  mother  superior  who  desires  that  the  fine  arts
               bloom,  will  probe  the  particular  dispositions  of  the  young
               women  by  asking  them  to  which  fine  art  they  feel  inclined,
               such as: music, sculpture, painting, etc. But before granting
               anyone the permission to study fine arts, the mother superior
               will suggest that they pray and she herself will do the same.

                    The  mother  superior  should  know  that  literary  studies
               open the mind to the people, helping them to succeed in the
               fine arts. Many persons fail for lack of talent and education,
               their  good  disposition  notwithstanding.  So,  if  a  person  is   481
               inclined  to  a  fine  art  and  applies  herself  without  having  the
               necessary education, she may not achieve perfection, nor will
               she become an artist. On the contrary, if a person is inclined
               to  a  fine  art  and  is  also  experienced  in  grammar,  history,
               mathematics or is a teacher, she will become an artist if she
               applies herself to it. To help a person improve her good taste
               and  be  successful  in  painting  or  in  sculpture,  etc.  let  her
               contemplate the masterpieces in Florence, Rome, and other
               cities.  For  this  reason  we  should  open.  a  house  in  a  city
               where teachers of fine arts abound (Ibidem).



                           3. A DRAWBACK TO BE AVOIDED

                    I  have  observed  in  various  houses  the  world's  habit  of
               displaying embroidery and the like, thus covering the]]></page><page Index="482"><![CDATA[beauty  of  the  holy  objects,  instead  of  beautifying  them. For
               instance: if you embroider a cross with gold by interweaving
               many designs, in the end you see the designs only, not the
               cross. Or if you make the corporals with large and denticulate
               fringes,  they  stick  to  the  alb  sleeves  of  the  priest  and  are
               drawn by the movements of the priest's hands. Or if you lace
               the alb from the flank to the feet or lace the whole sleeve, you
               do it against the rubrics. Or if you make the veil of the taber-
               nacle with strong solid fabric embroidered in gold, it becomes
               unbending,  and  the  priest  can  hardly  open  the  tabernacle.
               When he succeeds in opening it, the veil presses against it
               and closes the door again, making the priest feel uneasy.

                    The persons who make such works feel proud of them;
               they  instead  should  be  aware of  deserving blame,  because
               they use the holy objects to display their own style.

                    We  expressly  forbid  such  works.  The  cross  must  be
               entirely  visible  in  the  embroidery;  only  some  rays  may  be
               added at the four corners. The corporals must be very simple,
               having no fringes at the border. The alb must have the lace a   482
               span  tong,  and  the  surplice  half  a  span.  The  veil  for  the
               tabernacle  must  be  thin,  flexible,  and  easy  to  roll  at  the
               opening  of  the  little  door.  Fashionable  embroidery  is  only
               suitable when it conforms to these rules. The corporals with
               internal  embroidery  and  with  holes  are  forbidden,  because
               the sacred fragments pass through and are lost (Notes for a
               circular).]]></page><page Index="483"><![CDATA[NOTES

                   (1)    He  also  speaks  of  the  studies  introduced  at  the  Holy  Spirit
               convent:  «About  30  young  aspirants  to  religious  life  from  various
               towns   are   attending   various   courses,   such   as:   Italian   literature,
               history,   geography,   mathematics,   and   French   language.   Since   I
               consider that fine arts are the garb's splendor, we let our youths learn
               drawing, painting, and music.
                   (2)  Either to run our orphanages' schools or to open day schools
               with our religious teachers, our students must attend regular courses in
               order  to  get  the  teaching  credentials.  We  must    train    the  young
               candidates  for religious  life  to  become  skilled  and  promising  for our
               institute, such as those  (about  ten)  who are  in  Messina,  and provide
               them   with  study  opportunities.   For  this   reason   we  would like the
               superior  of  each  house  to  transfer  at  least  some  of  their  youths    to
               Messina  to study»   (Circular,  January  1925).

                             BEING HUMBLE IN SUCCESS

                    While  succeeding  in  study  or  In  fine  arts  or  in
               anything,  I  will  avoid  pride,  ambition,  and  selfishness,
               which  make  our  work  appear  to  us  a  hundred  times
               greater. I will refer the glory of any success to God, but
               the  reproach  to  myself,  not  only  because  I  must  be
               convinced that my work is little but also because of my
               fault  I  do  not  produce  what  I  should.  If  Jesus  said:  «
               When you have done all you have been told to do, say we
               are ordinary servants; we have only done our duty » (Lk.
               17, 10), what can I say of myself and of my spiritual or
               intellectual  or  material  work,  which  Is  always  less  than
               what I should do? I will say therefore: « Why should I go
               on using up the soil »  (Lk. 13, 7)?


                                                                         485

                               1. BEWARING OF PRIDE

                    We  recommend  the  candidates  for  religious  life  to
               beware  of  envy  and  pride,  because  the  devil  exploits  such
               vices in the industrious youth. No candidate for religious life
               will envy the fellows, nor will he become so enamored of the
               study as to neglect the religious practices, nor will he behave
               like the students for any civil profession, but will study for the
               glory  of  God,  for  the  good  of  his  soul,  and  for  the  good  of
               others (R.A.).

                    What  is  knowledge  without  holiness?  It  is  vanity  of
               vanities. A learned priest without holiness is a fateful]]></page><page Index="486"><![CDATA[ruin. A priest who knows perfectly the moral law, but does not
               observe it, is an inconsistent priest (Funeral oration on Canon
               Ardoino).



                                  2. THANKSGIVING

                    The  mother  superior  will  see  to  it  that  anyone  who
               succeeds  in  fine  arts  avoid  pride.  To  preserve  her  from
               vainglory, she will warn her strongly, helping her understand
               that everything is a gift from God and that everything must be
               referred to him and to the adorable Lord Jesus Christ. When
               the mother superior perceives that her warnings are useless,
               she will interrupt the vainglorious person's study in fine arts,
               regardless  of  her  success,  until  she  repents.  In  case  of
               obstinacy, the mother superior will remove her from the study
               for ever. The Lard will be pleased by that. To keep a youth
               humble and to dispel vainglory, the mother superior will help
               her consider how many persons are by far better than she is
               in fine arts!                                             486

                    When  the  sisters  are  advanced  in  fine  arts  and  have
               already  produced  good  works,  the  mother  superior  will
               organize  the  exhibition  every  now  and  then  to  foster  the
               institute's  reputation,  to  let  the  people  know  the  youth's
               achievements,  and  to  win  esteem,  respect,  and  admiration.
               On the whole, the exhibition helps the institutes of active life
               to  progress.  Introducing  the  exhibition  with  an  appropriate
               speech  in  the  presence  of  reporters  is  important  and
               convenient, for they recount the manifestation to the people
               at  large.  During  the  exposition  the  mother  superior  will  pay
               careful  attention  to  refer  the  good  success  to  God,  to  the
               adorable  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  to  the  most  holy  Virgin,  the
               angels, and the saints, helping the sisters to keep in mind this
               great truth as well]]></page><page Index="487"><![CDATA[as to remain humble by attributing their free gifts to God, by
               praising and by cheering him alone.

                    To direct everything to God, at the end of the exposition
               the  mother  superior  will  lead  the  community  to  praise  God
               through a thanksgiving in the church and the offering of a holy
               mass.

                    Convenience  suggests  that  the  community  write  the
               thanksgiving to the sweetest Heart of Jesus and to the most
               holy divine mother superior for the enlightenment and graces
               they have granted, such as: they helped us accomplish the
               works and moved many persons to visit the exposition to their
               great  satisfaction,  our  failures  notwithstanding.  The
               thanksgiving will end with an act of humility, for instance, by
               saying: (( We confess before you, O Lord, that we are good
               for nothing... See to it that everything may be beneficial to our
               soul and that we do not usurp your gifts as if they were ours;
               please help us to improve our sanctification, etc. )) We should
               also remember that many people in the world are doing better   487
               than we are!

                    This way God will bless the exposition for the institute's
               spiritual, and temporal progress, and will prepare new graces
               for his glory and the good of souls. Amen.



                                3. LITTLE THEATER (1)

                    The mother superior can allow theatrical performances in
               the  institutes,  orphanages,  and  boarding  schools.  She  will
               pay careful attention at the following:

                    1.  Dramas,  comedies,  farces,  and  other  performances
               must be very honest. On the whole, dramas must regard lives
               of  martyrs  and  the  like;  by  exception,  not  too  much
               passionate family love, such as between mother]]></page><page Index="488"><![CDATA[and children having a marked religious characteristic, may be
               allowed. (2)

                    2.  Because  women  are  not  allowed  to  represent  male
               characters, dramas of this kind will be avoided.

                    3. Anyone, either adult or child, is absolutely forbidden to
               dress  somehow  immodestly,  despite  the  character  she  is
               portraying.

                    4. Before approving a drama or a comedy or a farce, the
               mother  superior  will  eliminate  the  unbecoming  words.  For
               instance, sometimes the devil is called in interjections; that is
               improper, because we must always detest his name; or the
               most  holy  name  of  God  is  called  out  of  purpose,  in  vain;  it
               must  be  corrected.  If  intelligent  and  of  religious  taste,  the
               examiner of the contents will choose good dramas, comedies,
               farces, soliloquies etc., (3) adding or modifying something or
               dismissing  dull,  irrelevant  performances.  In  fact,  she  must
               also  pay  attention  to  the  fact  that  while  moralizing,
               performances  must  delight,  please  and  move  the  audience   488
               (S.D.D.Z.).





                                        NOTES

                   (1)  About  the  little  theater,  our  padre  touches upon  details  which
               are  worth  remembering:  «Because  it  is  of  importance  to  have  the
               audience happy and admired, the little theater must be arranged well. It
               should  be  wide  enough,  having  a  proportionate  background  and  the
               stage  slightly  inclined  but  high  enough  so  that  the  audience  may  see
               everything while sitting down. Where it is possible, the theater's hall may
               be also used for the exposition of works, fine arts, distribution of prizes,
               and  the  like.  If  the  theater's  orchestra  were  inclined  opposite  to  the
               stage, it would be better, because the performance would be under the
               eyes of all the people and would prevent the guests who are sitting in
               the last seats from standing in order to see better. The little theater will
               be provided with common scenes, which are suitable for various]]></page><page Index="489"><![CDATA[performances,  and  with  particular  ones;  at  least  two  curtains  re-
               presenting views of a little temple in the distance or hermitages or ships
               carrying missionaries will be part of the apparatus, etc. A happy event of
               our institute or a scene of sanctuaries, which belong to the city where
               the  educational  institute  stands,  is  also  appropriate.  Curtains,  scenes,
               wings, proscenium, etc., must be painted by experts. The lights will be
               disposed  in such  a  way as  to enhance  the  scenes.  Both curtains  and
               scenes must be placed in a firm cage to avoid any obstruction when they
               are  lifted  up  or  are  lowered,  otherwise  they  bother  the  audience  and
               embarass the actresses. Dresses will be smooth, various in color, and
               fitting to the performance (S.D.D.Z.).
                   (2)  As  to  the censure of  the  script,   our padre was  severe.   In
               the circular of Oct. 22,  1923,  he wrote:   «Passion dramas,  such  as
               mothers   in   search   of   their   daughters,   are   not   allowed   in   our
               theater,   because  we  must  avoid   teaching  our   orphans   about
               passionate  affection,  as experience  taught  us.  These  dramas  are
               also unfitting  for  the   sisters,   since   they   must   be   fond   of   our
               Lord only,   whereas   these   dramas   avert   their   attention   from
               him   for excess  of family affection.
                   More than once love expressions of husbands or lovers were in the
               dramas; we cannot allow it, not even by allusion. For this reason, if the
               drama of the farce lacks the approval of our institute, it will be sent to the
               direction for it.»
                   (3)  So that the performance may be effective, it needs:   489
                   a)    A  good  choice  of  characters  as  to  be    in  harmony  with  their
               roles;
                   b)    Good  rehearsal.  After  choosing    the  characters,  a  director  of
               good  taste  for  such  education  gathers  them  to  read  the  drama  many
               times until they are well impressed. Then, she tells them to transcribe
               their role  and  to  learn  it  by   heart.   Each  character will   recite   its
               role to the director. When  all  of them  are  prepared,   the  general
               rehearsal may start. The director will demand of each to speak loud and
               clearly, because children and  young women who did  not  learn how  to
               read well,  usually  recite fast  at a faint voice clipping  their speech,  and
               without  taking   care  of  punctuation.  The   teacher  will not go ahead
               until  they  amend.  To  overcome  this  serious  difficulty,  the  director  will
               demand of each character to  read, to declaim the script, and to gesture
               in  her presence in order to  improve them. After this preparation, the
               rehearsal  will  be  easy,  and  will  take less  time;    otherwise,      it    takes
               more   time  without  guaranteeing   success. In the ultimate  rehearsals,
               particular  attention  will    be  given    to    the  two  last  acts  of  the  drama,
               because  if  they  are  ill  performed,  they  ruin  the  effect  of  the  whole
               drama»  (S.D.O.Z.).]]></page><page Index="490"><![CDATA[490]]></page><page Index="491"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXVI

                                SACRED PREACHING

                   If  my  superiors  destine  me  to  preaching,  I  will  give
               preference  to  the  humblest  one,  such  as:  the
               evangelization of the poor and of children as well as the
               catechetical instruction to the people, avoiding to preach
               myself  Instead  of  Jesus  crucified.  While  preaching  or
               giving instructions or panegyrics or sermons, my topics
               will  be  always  about  morals  in  order  to  fight  sin  under
               any  form.  I  will  remind  the  people  of  the  eternal  truths
               and the need to pray, as well as our Lord Jesus Christ's
               love  and  sorrows,  the  holy  Sacraments,  and  the
               Eucharist, striving to spread the practice of frequent and
               daily  Communion  according  to  the  decree  by  the  Con-
               gregation of the Council. (1) I will use Holy Scripture, the
               Fathers  and  the  Doctors  of  the  Church,  as  well  as  the
               lives of the saints. I will spread the devotion to the most
               holy Virgin under any title, Including that to Our Lady of
               the Evangelical Rogation and to Our Lady of Divine Zeal   491
               (when they are approved), the devotion to the Patriarch
               St.  Joseph,  to  the  angels  and  the  saints.  I  will promote
               the  devotion  to  St.  Michael  the  archangel,  to  the  seven
               angels of the divine presence, to the guardian angels, to
               the holy apostles, the martyrs, the patron saints and to
               St. Anthony of Padua.
                   Even though I may sometimes use a higher style due
               to the supernatural themes I treat, nonetheless I must be
               very clear so that everyone, even children, uncouth and
               Ignorant  people  may  understand  the  spirit  of  my
               preaching  when  they  cannot  understand  the  words.
               Before preaching, I will prepare my sermon and will pray
               to the Most High to give success to the divine word, also
               making  a  special  Invocation  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  of
               Good Counsel and to my guardian angel.
                   Being  detached  from  any  compensation  for  my
               preaching, I will receive the offering the people give me
               spontaneously, which I will consign to my superiors.]]></page><page Index="492"><![CDATA[1. PREACHING APOSTOLICALLY

                    The  priests  destined to  the  preaching  will  often  preach
               Jesus  Christ'  crucified  with  holy  apostolical  simplicity  and
               unction, keeping in mind the decree by the Holy Father Leo
               XIll in order to reach the apostolical goal. They must be clear,
               accurate, and brief (C. R.). (2)



                              2. THE TRUE ELOQUENCE

                    We  hope  that  many  persons  are  convinced,  about  the
               real  value  of  the  gospel  preachers.  Please  reject  the  vain
               boasting of the entangled scholasticism and of the nebulous
               philosophy. When a parable of the gospel is explained well, it
               is  more  worthy  than  all  the  redundant  declamations.  The
               Christian morals are so rich that you can always draw from
               them successfully with a little work.

                    The  prophet  says  that  the  declaration  of  God's  word   492
               ,lightens  and  gives  understanding  to  the  children.  Wasn't  it
               through the practical treatment of morals that many preachers
               reached  the  top  of  Christian  eloquence,  as  Massillon,
               Bourdalue, and Bossuet in France, Segneri, Tornielli, Venini,
               Ventura and others in Italy? It was through the explanations
               of the gospel and the teaching of morals to the people that
               Tertulian, St. Augustine, St. Basil, and St. John Chrysostom,
               an  everlasting  miracle  of  Christian  eloquence,  reached  the
               top of oratory.

                    Please accustom yourselves to these morals; draw the
               sound  theological  doctrine  from  the  Bible,  the  Fathers,  and
               the gospel: Plan the contents of your preaching. Beautify and
               make  them  pleasant.  Cope  with  the  ministry  of  the  divine
               word with pure intention, contrition of heart,]]></page><page Index="493"><![CDATA[order, clarity, opportunity, sobriety of decoration, and you will
               improve  the  soul's!  We  must  keep  in  mind  that  we  must
               preach  Jesus  Christ  crucified,  not  ourselves  (From  the
               Catholic Word, Jan. 2, 1878)!

                           THE MINISTRY OF CONFESSION

                   I will strive to be available to hear confessions and to
               practice  such  a  ministry  with  caution  and  spirit  of
               sacrifice.

                    I  will  often  study  moral  theology,  will  attend  the
               monthly  moral  case  after  examining  it  thoroughly,  and
               will be acquainted with the censures, the cases reserved
               to  the  Ordinary,  the  dispositions  of  the Holy  See  about
               the administration of the sacraments, the fasting, and the
               like.  Instead  of  hearing  the  confessions  of  prominent
               people I will prefer hearing the confessions of  children,
               of  the  abandoned  poor,  and  of  the  sick,  being  always
               available to welcome everyone, rich, poor, and those who
               seldom go to confession.

                   As  to  the  confessions  of  women,  young  girls
               Included, I will be very cautious. I will never let them kiss   495
               my hand nor will I stare at their face nor will I lengthen
               out the  speech; on  the  contrary  I  will  keep  in  mind  the
               suggestion of St. Augustine, « talk with women must be
               brief and austere. »

                   If I am told to hear the confessions of the twin insti-
               tute's  sisters,  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  I  will  study
               their  constitutions  or  declarations.  Realizing  that  their
               rule demands of them to be brief in the confession, I will
               not lengthen them out, but I will expedite them.

                   Aware  of  the  great  difficulties  which  hinder  from
               exactly  fulfilling  the  duty  of  hearing  the  sacramental
               confessions,  I  will  resort  to  study,  to  God,  and  to  the
               most  holy  Virgin  for  graces,  enlightenment,  help,  and
               virtue in order to perform everything in a holy manner.]]></page><page Index="496"><![CDATA[Priests must be always available at the confessionals to
               hear  the  confessions  of  women  and  men,  giving  no
               preference to anyone (C.R.).

                    Because  the  moral  theology  leads  the  human  actions
               toward God for the eternal salvation of the people, the priest
               will study moral theology thoroughly. It teaches which actions
               are good, which are neutral in quality, which lead to ruin or to
               salvation. By giving the rules of living according to divine law,
               moral  theology  guides  the  people  by  hand  to  eternal'
               salvation.  Therefore,  it  is  an  indispensable  science  for  the
               priests,  who  must  study  it  under  strict  obligation  of
               conscience. Knowledge of moral theology is as important and
               indispensable as it is difficult, because it is not so pleasant as
               dogma tics, which lifts human minds to the sublime regions of
               the infinite. The priests have to strive hard to learn it by heart.
               This  study  requires  a  special  disposition,  a singular  insight,
               perseverance  of  good  will,  anal  untiring  patience  (On  the
               death of Canon Ardoino).

                                                                         496]]></page><page Index="497"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXVIII

                                  MY CONFESSION

                   After speaking of the ministry of holy confession to
               which I must attend as a confessor, now as a penitent I
               consider the importance of practicing such a sacrament
               to profit by It. Following our constitutions, I will go every
               week  to  confession  after  preparing  myself  attentively.  I
               will  prefer  the  confessors  of  the  same  institute,  but  for
               good reasons I can ask the superiors to provide me with
               an external one.
                   Since  the  sacrament  of  reconciliation  has  been
               established  to  forgive  sins,  to  become  reconciled  with
               God, and to Improve the spiritual life, I will strive to have
               a humble, contrite, sincere, and resolute heart at the feet
               of the confessor.
                   After  kneeling  humbly  and  after  saying  the  «  I
               confess... », I will manifest, with contrite heart and voice,
               the sins I have committed in thoughts, words, and works
               as  well  as  my  defects  and  offences  against  these   497
               declarations  and  against  our  rules,  adding  the
               aggravating circumstances. I will not justify myself, nor
               will I hide even the least defects, nor will I lay the blame
               on others; on the contrary, I will charge myself with fault.
                   By  considering  how  much  a  priest  displeases  God
               even  through his  venial  sins  and how dangerous  these
               sins are, I will excite a deep sorrow in my heart for my
               offences  against  God,  firmly  proposing  to  amend  as
               though  my  confession  were  the  last  one  and  I  were
               dying.  I  will  profit  by  the  words,  admonitions,  and
               counsels of the confessor as if Jesus Christ himself were
               speaking  to  me,  and  will  do  the  penance  and  the
               thanksgiving  prayer  for  the  confession  shortly  after  It.
               Were  I  to  commit  a  somewhat  grave  fault,  I  will  go  to
               confession  before  going  to  sleep:  I  pledge  this  in  the
               most solemn and outspoken way. Were it impossible for
               me to confess the same day (but I will find a way to do
               so), I will concentrate myself with acts of sorrow and love
               at the foot of the Holy]]></page><page Index="498"><![CDATA[Sacrament in the evening, and the next day I will hasten
               to make my confession.

                    I acknowledge that going to confession often, even
               twice  or  three  times  a  week,  is  a  great  means  of
               sanctification; I am firmly convinced that if I were really
               convinced  of  this  truth,  I  would  go  to  confession  more
               than once a week. Were the scruples, however, to move
               me  to  do  so,  I  will  follow  the  confessor's  advice  and
               commands as well as the moderators of my conscience.


                                 1. THE OBLIGATION

                    On the day of their weekly confession, while meditating
               in  the  morning,  the  novices  will  ask  the  mast  holy  Heart  of
               Jesus  to  grant  them  the  grace  of  a  good  confession,  to
               understand  deeply  and  entirely  their  defects  along  with
               malice,  and  to  confess  them  to  the  priest  with  a  humble,
               docile, contrite heart. Before going to confession, following St.   498
               Francis of Sales' suggestion, they will gather in the choir or in
               another place in order to make the examination of conscience
               for 15 minutes, the act of contrition, and the promise to never
               sin  again.  That  day,  the  novices  will  be  more  contrite  and
               recollected, and will make their confession by speaking briefly
               and concisely. They will consider the confessor as our Lord
               Jesus Christ; therefore, they will respect him and will receive
               each of his words as the word of God, calling to mind that our
               Lord Jesus Christ said to his priests, «Whoever listens to you,
               listens  to  me  »  (Lk.  10,  16).  I  recommend  it  to  my  spiritual
               daughters, the Little Retreat novices, and exhort them to keep
               it  in  their  mind  in  order  to  practice  it  with  our  Lord  Jesus
               Christ's  help.  They  will  receive  the  confessor  that  holy
               obedience  gives  them as  he  were  given  by  Gad;  therefore,
               they will not change]]></page><page Index="499"><![CDATA[him, because changing the confessor without a good reason
               is to the prejudice of the spirit (R.L.P.). (1)

                    Established by our Lord Jesus Christ to forgive sins, the
               sacrament of reconciliation is also a most effective means for
               the people to achieve Christian perfection. The probationers
               will  hold  it  in  great  esteem,  striving  to  use  it  with  the  due
               dispositions.  They  will  go  to  confession  every  week,  after
               preparing themselves in common through the examination of
               conscience over even the least defects, and after fostering a
               deep sorrow and contrition. They are recommended to do it
               with a humble, sincere, contrite heart:  Humble means going
               to the feet of the priest with inner feelings of humility in order
               to confess not only the faulty actions but also the intentions,
               not only the defects, but also the passions that are the roots
               of the defects, without justifying themselves, according to St.
               Francis of Sales' suggestions. Humility in confession requires
               of the penitent to charge himself with fault, not others, as well
               as to follow in everything the confessor's counsels, warnings,
               and  admonitions.  The  probationers  are  forbidden  to  say
               things concerning the confession (P.R.P.). (2)            499



                                  2. THE PRACTICE

                    The sacrament of reconciliation is a priceless gift of the
               most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus.  May  everyone  profit  by  it!  This
               divine  sacrament  not  only  forgives  sins,  but  also  helps
               wonderfully those who are willing to improve holy virtues and
               to achieve perfection. When a Religious goes to confession in
               the spirit of penance and humility, she receives a very special
               grace, which prevents her from lapsing and from falling in the
               daily imperfections.

                    To attain the effects of this very precious sacrament,]]></page><page Index="500"><![CDATA[the person consecrated to the Lord should receive it with the
               due dispositions. While going to confession, she will have a
               mind to go to the tribunal of penance in order to purify herself
               from even the least sin, and to adorn herself with the merits of
               our Lord Jesus Christ's Mast Precious Blood, which overflows
               in this sacrament. The Daughters of Divine Zeal will go to the
               sacrament  of  reconciliation  with  this  holy  aim,  and  will
               practice the five requirements of the holy confession.

                    1. Examination of conscience. We cannot suffer a hasty,
               shallow  examination   of   conscience.  After   imploring
               enlightenment  and  graces  in  order  to  remember  the  faults
               committed since the last confession, as well as to resolve, to
               repent,  and  to  confess  with  great  humility,  clearness,  and
               simplicity, the examination of conscience must last at least 15
               minutes. After the preparation, each one will think over even
               her venial sins, the number of them and the circumstances.
               No  person  consecrated  to  the  Lord  and  willing  to  sanctify
               herself  is  al9owed  to  confess  a  sin  without  specifying  how
               many times it was committed as well as its circumstances. To
               tell  the  truth,  theologically  speaking  the  people  are  not   500
               required necessarily to confess venial sins; but a person who
               is  willing  to  belong  totally  to  God,  who  detests  any  offence
               against Him, who strives to amend from any imperfection and
               bad  habit,  who  absolutely  wants  to  avoid  indifference;  who
               wants to improve the love of Jesus and the religious virtues,
               this  person  feels  very  obliged  to  confess  the  venial  sins  in
               order to achieve perfection. Every one knows that negligence
               in  avoiding  venial  sins  is  the  first  step  for  falling  in  serious
               faults.

                    Mindful of the words that our Lord addressed to all, but
               especially to the Religious and to the persons consecrated to
               him: « You must be perfect - just as your]]></page><page Index="501"><![CDATA[Father in heaven is  perfect »  (Mt. 5, 48), the Daughters of
               Divine Zeal must be aware of the least imperfection. Another
               time Jesus said: « You will give account even of an idle word!
               »  Therefore,  the  sisters  will  confess  the  least  imperfections
               along  with  number  and  circumstances,  (3)  after  making  a
               good examination of conscience. I submit some examples to
               you.  Suppose  that  one  is  at  fault  with  obedience;  she  will
               think both over how many times she disobeyed and over the
               circumstances, which are important in the process of spiritual
               improvement; or a sister disobeyed after her another superior
               had told her to do something urgent, or she knew beforehand
               that disobedience could cause bad effects; or a sister failed in
               her important office, causing inconveniences and much grief
               to the mother superior, and so on.

                    Bad  example  is  a  circumstance  which  must  be  never
               neglected  in  the  examination  of  conscience  and  in  con-
               fession.  Saying,  far  instance,  «  I  kept  some  unnecessary
               objects, against the rule of poverty, » a is not complete. The
               sister  has to  specify  how many  and  what  the  objects  were,
               when  she  felt  the  remorse,  and  when  despite  the  remorse   501
               she did not hand them over to the mother superior. Or, if the
               sister  received  the  objects  from  fellows,  she  has  to  specify
               that she set a bad example to them by receiving the objects.

                    The root means the passion or the internal malice which
               pushes people to do ill. For instance, if a sister received the
               objects  from  a  fellow  under  the  pressure  of  false  courtesy
               more than by ambition, the fault is due to her own inordinate
               esteem,  because  she  avoided  to  appear  rude.  Let  us
               suppose instead that she received]]></page><page Index="502"><![CDATA[the  objects  because  she  was  tied  by  a particular  friendship
               and  she  did  not  wish  to  displease  her  friend  in  order  to
               maintain  her  friendship.  Here,  the  root  is  the  inordinate
               attachment  to  a  creature.  Now,  let  us  suppose  that  the
               appropriation  happened  without  the  cooperation  of  others.
               Here  we  find  two  sins:  embezzlement  and  infringement  of
               poverty. But the main root is greed. We said main, because
               we may find other roots generating a sin; for instance, if the
               sister  took  the  objects  in  order  to  use  them,  she  did  so
               because of her attachment to comfort.

                    In  the  examination  of  conscience  also  the  aim  of  our
               actions is to be considered. Far instance, if a sister took or
               retained the objects in order to figure in some occasion, such
               an aim shows that the root or passion is vainglory.

                    Oh! If the Lord enlightened us to perceive and define our
               sins and our light imperfections as they really are, hove many
               roots  of  hidden  passions  we  would  discover  in  ourselves!
               Hence the necessity of making a very accurate examination
               of  conscience  with  recollection  and  divine  enlightenment,   502
               instead  of  making  it  on  the  surface,  as  some  do!  If  both
               examination of conscience and confession were made in full,
               the  people  would  improve  very  much!  They  would  kill  their
               hidden  passions  by  a  renewal  of  spirit  and  by  adorning
               themselves  in  the  sacrament  of  reconciliation.  They  would
               share the Lord's supper while wearing the wedding dress and
               the  splendid  jewels  of  divine  kindness,  and  would  appear
               beautiful and immaculate to the eyes of the celestial spouse!

                    During the examination of conscience, careful attention
               must be also paid to the habit of the sin, because the habit is
               the  cause  of  relapse;  therefore  it  must  be  withdrawn.  The
               consideration  of  the  habit  and  of  the  relapse  helps  the
               persons to repent and to confess in]]></page><page Index="503"><![CDATA[order  to  destroy  their  bad  habits  with  the  Lord's  help.  The
               purification  of  the  person  should  be  the  real  profit  derived
               from confession.

                    To  conclude  this  topic,  we  suppose  another  case.  If  a
               person  had  a  mortal  sin  -  (God  forbid  it)  -  but  she  did  not
               confess it for serious lack of examination of conscience, the
               confession would be invalid.

                    2.  Repentance.  Repentance  of  one's  own  sins  and
               resolution to never sin again are most important; they matter
               much more than the examination of conscience. It is obvious
               that  those  who  do  not  repent  sincerely  of  their  faults  are
               unwilling to amend. Well then, what's the use of confession
               for them? They must pay careful attention to repentance and
               resolution.

                    A consecrated person who pledged fidelity to God as to
               her divine spouse, and received innumerable graces from him
               cannot  help  repenting  deeply  after  making  a  good
               examination  of  conscience  and  discovering  so  many  venial   503
               sins.

                    We have said venial sins; but they are offence against
               God. They are the cause of very deep sorrow to the Heart of
               Jesus,  because  he  requires  greatest  faithfulness  and
               perfection of his brides, who have pledged so many times to
               never displease him.

                    Please let us consider the two following truths:

                    First,  if  all  souls  who  are  in  hell  would  be  liberated  by
               committing even a venial deliberate sin, such a sin should not
               be committed. The reason is that all creatures, compared with
               God, are as nothing, as though they did not exist, says the
               Scripture.
                    Second,  our  Lord  takes  into  much  consideration  the
               deliberate venialities and negligences of the persons who are
               consecrated to him, because he asks of them compensation
               for the sins of the world. When he finds no]]></page><page Index="504"><![CDATA[compensation,  we  say  that  he  suffers  more  the  venial  sins
               committed -by the consecrated persons than the mortal sins
               committed by the mundane people. The Lord excuses more
               the  mundane,  because  they  have  less  knowledge  and  less
               spiritual  help  than  the  persons-consecrated  to  him.  For  the
               sinners who are ire the world, Jesus can repeat the words he
               said on the crass: « Forgive them, Father! They don't know
               what they are doing » (Lk. 23, 34). Can he say the same for
               you,  O  soul,  who  received  instructions,  spiritual  readings,
               exhortations,  and  teachings?  Who  listened  to  many
               preachings, who have been granted many graces, who were
               enlightened  so  often,  and  who  have  rules  and  additional
               helps? Hove can Jesus say of you, Daughter of Divine Zeal, «
               Forgive her, Father! She does not know what she is doing »
               (Lk. 23, 34)? You are fully aware of how Jesus is displeased
               for the venial sins you commit deliberately or by negligence,
               owing to not retracted habits or to bad roots of not mortified
               passions.  If  Jesus  were  subject  to  death,  he  would  die  of
               affliction at the sight of your faults and relapses, because they
               render  you  lukewarm  and  push  you  on  the  edge  of  grave
               faults and eternal perdition!                             504

                    These  reasons  give  you  ground  far  a  deep,  intimate,
               loving, and mournful repentance for any imperfection and sin
               that  you  acknowledge  in  your  accurate  examination  of
               conscience,  before going  to  confession.  Through  your  faith,
               you will see Jesus shedding tears for your sins, showing you
               his adorable wounds bleeding for your offences against him,
               and asking you to pour balm on the wounds you caused. The
               tears  of  your  sincere  repentance  will  be  the  balm.  While
               preparing  yourself  for  the  sacrament  of  reconciliation  by
               considering  these  notes,  you  will  raise  your  sincere
               repentance  and  will  show  it  to  Jesus  through  the  inner,
               beautiful words that the love]]></page><page Index="505"><![CDATA[of  Jesus  will  suggest  to  you.  You  will  imagine  yourself  as
               dropping  down  at  his  feet  to  ask  forgiveness  with  the  most
               tender voices of your heart, and to promise with his help that
               you will never offend him again at any cost.

                   Your resolution consists in this promise.

                   3. Resolution. Repentance of one's own sins without the
               resolution  to  never  sin  again  is  a  false,  fictious,  deceitful
               repentance.  Wouldn't  it  be  another  offense  against  God?
               Making such a confession and receiving the absolution would
               be a sacrilege.

                   Helped  by  divine  grace,  which  never  fails  the  persons
               who  ask  for  it,  each  Religious  of  this  community  must  pay
               careful attention to raise a sincere repentance and to make
               the resolution to sin no more. Everyone should imagine her
               confession as the last one of her life and herself as a dying.
               How  contrite  and  resolute  to never  sin  she would  be  in  the
               tribunal of penance! And yet, no one knows if she is about to
               die soon after the confession or in the following days. Hasn't   505
               it  happened  so  to  many  people  who  went  to  confession
               without thinking that it might be the last one? Had they known
               it,  with  how  much  repentance  they  would  have  made  their
               confession! Couldn’t it happen to you?

                   While  preparing  yourself,  see  to  it  that  your  repentance
               and resolution be just as Jesus requires them! In fact, if Jesus
               does not absolve you from heaven, the priest's absolution is
               useless  or  sacrilegious.  In  this  case  you  become  more
               inclined to evil, and by approaching the great banquet of the
               angels  without  the  wedding  dress  you  attract  the
               condemnation and the rejection of Jesus as a just judge. You
               do  not  receive  him  as  a  loving  spouse!  Instead  of  being
               medicine  and  salvation,  the  beneficial  sacrament  of
               reconciliation would be for you poison and ruin.]]></page><page Index="506"><![CDATA[4. Confession. Each one will approach the sacrament of
               reconciliation to confess her sins to the minister of God, being
               prepared, contrite, and with her eyes cast down.

                    She  will  hold  the  confessor  as  the  deputy  of  Jesus
               Christ  without  making  any  distinction  between  the  various
               confessors, and will begin her confession by saying: Father,
               forgive  me,  because  I  have  sinned.  After  the  prayer  I
               confess... (possibly in Latin), she will tell the father her sins,
               making her confession entire, humble, clear, simple, contrite,
               and sorrowful.


                    Entire confession means that the penitent has to confess
               her  sins  along  with  the  number,  the  species,  and  the
               circumstances, denouncing the root and everything we have
               said in the examination of conscience. A Religious who takes
               care  both  of  amending  bad  inclinations  and  of  improving
               holiness, confesses even the least defects she has found in
               her examination, without leaving out anything.
                                                                         506
                    Humble  confession:  the  Religious  must  beware  of
               justifying her defects; instead of diminishing her responsibility
               or laying part of the blame on others, she has to increase her
               fault, laying the blame on herself. The more she pleads guilty
               (she has already said through my own fault in the I confess),
               the  more  she  finds  mercy  and  forgiveness  in  the  adorable
               Jesus. This is the humble confession.

                    Humble confession also demands that the penitent listen
               to  the  confessor's  advice  and  reproaches  respectfully,
               profiting by them as though our Lord himself were speaking
               and admonishing.

                    Clear   confession   regarding   the   speech:   the
               pronunciation  must  be  clear  so  that  the  priest  may
               understand  everything  without  being  compelled  to  ask  you:
               please]]></page><page Index="507"><![CDATA[speak clearly. This fact requires a proper distance between the
               persons who are making confession and the others who are waiting
               outside. The confessional must be done in such a way as to prevent
               the outsiders from hearing.


                    Simple  confession:  holy  simplicity  in  pleading  guilty  in
               the  confession  demands  avoidance  of  useless  words.  The
               penitents  will  follow  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  saying,  «  Just
               say, "Yes" or "No" » (Mt. 5, 37).

                    Simplicity  helps  the  confession  to  be  short:  which  we
               recommend to the Daughters of Divine Zeal. They will avoid
               the bad habit of prolonging the confession beyond necessity
               by practicing St. Theresa's suggestion: « Be long at the feet
               of the Crucifix, but short at the feet of the confessor. » We do
               not deny, however, that either the confessor or the penitent
               sometimes  needs  to  prolong  the  confession  beyond  the
               ordinary time. The matter is: we must avoid to give free play
               to selfishness as well as to lose time and simplicity of spirit.
               The confessor is under the control of God alone; the results   507
               of  abuses  are  perceptible  however.  Generally,  those  who
               spend more time at the confessional are the  less observant
               and  the  less  earnest,  the  crack-brained  who  are  the  most
               troublesome in many circumstances.

                    Simplicity is also concerned with the Daughters of Divine
               Zeal's prudence. A sister who loves the institute, the house,
               and the superiors, will avoid saying things which discredit the
               community or scandalize the confessor. The sisters who give
               free play by selfishness make the confessor believe that they
               are treated uncharitably or are compelled to overwork or are
               not cured properly in their sickness. They do not behave as
               daughters  of  the  institute,  but  as  strangers  who  harm  the
               institute and hinder vocations. In this case the confessor feels
               himself obliged to impede some sisters from continuing]]></page><page Index="508"><![CDATA[in the religious life. May Jesus free this humble community of
               the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  from  such  individuals!  These
               unfaithful persons are self-confident because the superiors do
               not  know  what  has  been  said  in  confession,  nor  they  can
               contradict  it,  nor  can  they  justify  themselves.  Should  it
               happen  (God  forbid  it),  these  individuals  must  consider  that
               God knows everything, will punish them, and will deliver the
               community from their charges.

                    Contrite  confession:  compunction  requires  of  the
               penitents  to  express  their  contrite  mood  in  the  confession.
               Even the tone of the voice is apt to express the inner feelings,
               the sorrow, and humiliation.

                    The, sorrowful confession concerns the repentance and
               the  resolution  which  the  penitent  made  during  the
               examination  of  conscience  and  expressed  in  the  act  of
               contrition,  before  receiving  the  absolution.  The  penitent  will
               say  it  with  deep  humility,  compunction,  and  repentance,
               expressing  the  resolution  to  never  sin  again  with  internal   508
               conviction.

                    5.  Penance  or  satisfaction.  After  the  accusation  of  her
               sins,  the  penitent  will  conclude  by  saying:  «  Father,  forgive
               me, and give me the penance. » After receiving the penance
               with humility, she will return contrite and modest, will kneel,
               and  will  do  her  penance.  Soon  after  she  will  make  the
               thanksgiving for the forgiveness of her sins and for the graces
               she has received in the sacrament of reconciliation.

                    Warning:  We  prevent  everyone  from  becoming  dis-
               heartened on the suggestion of the evil for the fact that after
               the sorrowful confession and the resolution to never sin again
               she commits the same faults.

                    When a sister commits without deliberation the faults she
               has  confessed  with  sorrow  and  with  the  resolution  to  never
               commit them again, she must not be afraid nor]]></page><page Index="509"><![CDATA[discouraged;  instead,  she  has  to  humble  herself,  sweetly
               renewing  her  resolution.  In  fact,  even  though  the  Lord  is
               displeased by these defects, yet he finds satisfaction in the
               humility and in the resolution of the person who is willing to
               amend. If while receiving the absolution or while making the
               resolution  to  never  sin  again  the  penitent  foresees  that  she
               will  relapse,  this  fact  does  not  prevent  her  sorrow  and
               resolution  from  being  true.  Here  is  the  rub:  the  sister  must
               really want her sanctification and her amendment from even
               the least imperfections. Who finds herself in these conditions,
               must be calm. She must not become disheartened, nor lose
               trust, nor listen to the hellish enemy, who fosters distrust and
               discouragement,  but  will  humble  herself  and  will  ask  her
               spouse  to  forgive  and  to  help.  She  will atone  with  penance
               and love, and all this will help her to be closer to the Lord.
               Thus, the saying of the apostle « We know that in all things
               God works for goad with those who love him » (Ram. 8, 28),
               comes true (S.D.D.Z.). (4)


                                                                         509


                                        NOTES

                    (1)    Because  in  the  confession  we  have  to  say  only  the  things
               regarding  the sacrament,   I  promise  to  observe  the  following   rule: I
               will  spend  at  the  confessional  the  time  necessary  for  the  confession
               without speaking  of the  direction  and  of the discipline which  rule the
               institute.  Still  less  will  I  escape  the  regular  observance  by  using  the
               confessor's    counsel    or  consent,    because    the  confessor    is    not
               qualified   to   interfere   in   the   direction   and   the   discipline   of   the
               institute;  therefore,  I  will  behave  according  to  the  mother  superior's
               orders, counsels, and guide according to the institute's rules (D.P.).
                   (2)    «  Each   congregant  will  go to confession  every  week, either
               with  the  ordinary  or  the  extraordinary  confessors  of  the  community.
               Holding  in great esteem  the sacrament of reconciliation,  everyone]]></page><page Index="510"><![CDATA[will prepare himself and will confess his defects along with the cause of
               them  with  great  humility,  as  required  by  religious  perfection.  After
               exciting a sharpest sorrow for his sins, he will make a firm resolve to sin
               no more, will follow the confessor's counsels, doing at last his penance
               faithfully. During the confession no one will apologize for his-defects nor
               will he speak of things which have nothing to do with the sacrament. The
               confession will be brief, simple, umble, and sincere; such a confession
               will bring out great profits (C.R.).
                   (3) Our padre wrote the following formula to help the sisters have a
               good examination of conscience:
                   «  Have  you  neglected  the  meditatoin  under  some  pretext  or  for

               resolve,  humility,  sincerity,  simplicity,  without  useless  speech  and

               (4) a) < Each one will avoid to busy the confessor with the community's
               regime nor will she seek advice from him about it.
               The confessor is not the institute's director. Had the Religious to follow
               the  confessor's  advice  about  the  institute's  regime,  each  confessor
               would give his own counsel, following his way of thinking; the rules of the
               institute,  therefore,  should  be  changed  continuously,  which  is
               unacceptable.
                   b) No one will talk about things regarding the confession, such as

                         PERSEVERANCE IN THE INSTITUTE

                   Because I entered this pious Institute by my own free
               will,  and  received  a  hearty  welcome  when  I  joined  this
               religious group, I feel obliged to love and consider it as
               my spiritual family.
                   I declare that I want to persevere in it faithfully and
               lovingly,  and  even  though  any  congregant  can  freely
               leave the Institute before taking the perpetual vows, I flee
               from  this  thought  because  Jesus  said:  «  Anyone  who
               starts to plow and then keeps looking back is of no use
               for the kingdom of God » (Lk. 9, 62), Ecclesiasticus has
               also:  « Stand firm in the lot set before thee. »

                   Were  a  real  reason  to  suggest  Itself  to  leave  the
               Institute  before  taking  the  perpetual  vows,  the  reason
               should  be  the  serious  decline  of  the  whole  order.  The
               decline  of  a  single  community,  the  difficulty  to  observe
               the  rule  or  these  promises,  the  inconveniences  of  holy   513
               poverty,  being  on  bad  terms  with  someone,  personal
               oppositions,  the  sacrifice  required  to  face  work,  the
               insinuations or the difficulties to follow holy obedience,
               pretext of health, and the like are not a good reason to
               leave the institute. Therefore, I will consider these moti-
               vations  as  temptations  of  the  hellish  enemy,  and  will
               manifest them to the superior in order to get rid of them.

                   An  additional  dangerous  snare  of  the  devil  is  the
               suggestion  to  seek  advice  from  priests  who  are  not
               committed  to  holy  perfection,  nor  are  they  acquainted
               with  religious  life;  on  the  contrary,  they  oppose  this
               institute by instinct, and do not trust it.

                   If   reasons   of   general   decline   oppose   my
               perseverance,  I  will  not  make  any  decision  before
               submitting everything to the superiors, before praying to
               the  Heart  of  Jesus  and  the  most  holy  Virgin  Mary,  and
               before  taking  advice  from  holy  wise  priests,  especially
               the religious ones.]]></page><page Index="514"><![CDATA[1. LET US LOVE OUR INSTITUTE

                    I promise to exactly observe not only this institute's rule
               but  also  its  present  and  future  customs  along  with  its
               practices. As a member of this institute by the grace of the
               Lord, I will cherish and consider it as the house of my spiritual
               activity  and  as  my  spiritual  family;  its  interests  will  be  mine
               (D.P.).

                    The  probationers  will  consider  the  religious  community
               as their real family, and from now on they will love it strongly,
               constantly, and invincibly, dedicating themselves to it for ever
               with all their strength (R.P.).

                    One who has left his family home to devote himself to
               the  religious  institute,  must  love  it  with  great  respect,
               affection, and interest considering it as his own native abode,
               where he has been born again spiritually; therefore, it is his
               real spiritual family, whose pains, joys, and fortunes he must
               feel and share with a strong, constant love (C.R.).
                                                                         514
                    The  holy  cross,  suffering,  and  want  are  necessary
               means to form an institution, but happy is she who immolates
               herself  for  the  consolation  of  the most holy Heart  of  Jesus!
               The  Daughter  of  Divine  Zeal  must  carry  the  cross  and
               immolate  herself  for  the  sanctification  and  the  salvation  of
               souls (Letter without date)!

                    Let  us  love  our  institute;  let  us  give  ourselves  to  it  in
               order  to  build  its  spiritual  structure...  Let  us  not  be
               disheartened...  Let  us  love  the  institute  and  its  dear  name:
               Rogation of Jesus' Heart. Jesus loves it; he gave us the most
               beautiful hopes for its future; if we reflect on it, we realize that
               God wants it!

                    Even  though  our  institute  is  small,  still  its  aim  and
               mission are such that belonging to it and sharing in it make us
               happy! I am not speaking of the poor, nor of the]]></page><page Index="515"><![CDATA[orphans, but of the banner,« Pray, therefore, to the owner of
               the harvest... » What a mercy, what a gift! What an honor is
               our  being  appointed  to  pick  up,  spread,  and  point  out  this
               word to Christianity. It is like saying: behold, people, here is
               the remedy to all evils! Such a mission is so sublime that I
               feel like annihilating myself (Speech, April 21, 1907)!

                    The vocation to a religious institute is a great gift of God,
               through  which  you  can  assure  your  salvation  and
               sanctification! But, what merit did you have? « I loved Jacob,
               but I hated Esau » (Rom. 9, 13). How many people God has
               left out! You were a poor child, but behold! God chose you
               (Speech,  Feb.  1,  1912).  Who  were  you?  Which  were  your
               wishes? What was your infancy? What the fortunes of your
               life?  Oh,  how  far  you  were  from  thinking  of  such  a  great
               honor! Perhaps the doors of the religious houses would have
               never  opened  for  you,  if  the  Lord  had  not  raised  this  least
               institute! The Lord formed it to take you away from the world
               and to place you here (Speech, April 21, 1907)..

                    Let us consider the great present the Lard made to us by   515
               calling  us  to  this  institute,  and  by  making  us  became  most
               particular  because  of  two  special  reasons.  The  Lord,
               however, wants us to esteem it, to be grateful, and to answer
               so a great mercy.

                    a)  The  first  reason  resides  in  the  beginning  of  the
               foundation.  What  is  a  religious  foundation  all  about?  It  is  a
               mystery of grace and salvation! A new harbor, a new ladder
               of Jacob, a work pleasing the angels.

                    b) The first vacations are privileged. When an institute is
               already  formed  and  spread,  the  persons  who  go  to  it  find
               everything  ready,  and  they  somehow  enjoy  the  fruit  of  the
               work  of  the  previous  vacations.  The  first  vocations  instead,
               are called to form the institute, to lay]]></page><page Index="516"><![CDATA[down its foundations; if they answer the call, their merits wall
               be great before the Lord, because they are the founders, and
               deserve the praise of the future vocations! Well then, the Lord
               called  us  first  to  form  the  institute,  to  be  the  foundation
               stones. Oh, what a gift!

                    Small as it may be a community, each member has two
               main  obligations:  1)  he  has  to  strive  to  achieve  personal
               perfection;  2)  he  has  to  strive  together  with  the  fellows  to
               achieve the perfection of the community, and of the institute.

                    Dearest brothers, it is Gads will that each of us sanctify
               himself; that all the members form this least institute as God
               wants it; and that it last for his glory and for the good of souls.
               In other words, the Lard wants us not to hinder, but to foster
               his aims and ways (Speech, April 21, 1925).


                               2. WE ARE FORTUNATE

                    The formation of an institute pleases God so much, and   516
               gladdens the Heart of Jesus, the most holy Mary, the angels,
               and  the  saints.  All  of  them  help  us,  but  hell  shudders  and
               persecutes  nothing  else  so  much  as  the  formation  of  a
               religious institute.

                    Let  us  work!  We  cannot  form  it  with  flying  colors,  but
               difficulties will not dishearten us... Please let us strive for our
               sanctification, seeking the institute's formation as God wants
               it!  Please  let  us  perform  all  things  as  well  as  we  can  to
               sanctify  ourselves,  let  us  sanctify  ourselves  in  order  to
               perform what we can... Let us answer our call It depends on
               our faithfulness if the Lord will carry out his loving aims on us
               and on the institute.

                    In  his  infinite  goodness  our  Lord  gave  us  so  -many
               graces and the hope that he will fulfill his loving aims]]></page><page Index="517"><![CDATA[and  our  wishes,  if  we  are  faithful.  Let  us  remember  the
               marvelous ways through which he guided us: we reached the
               present  position  from  almost  nothing;  he  gave  us  plenty  of
               means, helping us to overcome several obstacles; everytime
               we were prostrated, he raised us. He gave us many spiritual
               favors through many illustrious prelates...

                    If the Lord has decided to form this institute, we must be
               the first stones with his help, as it happens in the foundations:
               the  first  members  deserve  the  foundation's  merit.  See,
               therefore, of how great importance is striving to achieve; our
               sanctification by answering our call!

                    How much the mast holy Heart of Jesus rejoices when
               we  work  for  the  formation  of  a  small  religious  community!
               How much he rejoices when we strive to spread the Rogate,
               because  the  Rogate  will  prepare  the  new  generations  of
               Levites. Let us trust in the most holy Heart of Jesus. Isn't be
               interested in developing the institute?

                    Let  us  also  trust  in  the  most  holy  Mary,  because  she   517
               shares the interests of Jesus' Heart. Jesus is with us in the
               Holy Sacrament, and the most holy Mary is with us because
               we  are  consecrated  to  her,  as  her  children  and  slaves,
               through a continuous devotion. Jesus and Mary are with us,
               or better yet, we are with Jesus and Mary from the time we
               have  proclaimed  them  as  our  absolute,  effective,  and
               immediate superiors, invoking them as such.

                    At  last,  let  us  trust  in  St.  Joseph.  Besides  being  the
               universal patron, he too is concerned with the Rogate! In fact,
               it is under his auspices that we renew the vows every year,
               asking him for inner virtue.

                    Because we have children and poor persons, we must
               pay careful attention to edify them. Let us be vigilant so that
               sin  may  not  enter;  it  would  be  the  ruin!  We  would  see
               providence fail!]]></page><page Index="518"><![CDATA[Children and brothers in Jesus Christ, if we are faithful, if
               we  strive  to  improve  holiness,  to  seek  the  salvation  of  the
               souls, and to spread the Rogate; if we are patient, if we have
               a  .pure  intention  and  the  spirit  of  sacrifice,  and  if  we  pray,
               sooner or later God will look upon us and upon the institute to
               fulfill his laving aims, which are beyond our thoughts (Ibidem).

                    Your fortune is that you are one who leaves her native
               house  out  of  love  for  Jesus,  and  detaches  herself  from
               everything,  renouncing  eventual  positions  in  the  world  in
               order  to  choose  the  best  part,  the  Creator  of  heaven  and
               earth, to whom she offers herself as an everlasting holocaust
               of  love!  This  happiness  has  various  degrees,  this  wedding
               with the supreme goodness has several functions. The mare
               your  spiritual  intelligence  is  piercing,  and  the  more  your
               affections  of  faith  are  ,intimate  and  delicate,  the  more  the
               band  of  your  mystical  wedding  is  tightened.  The  more  you
               imitate his divine humility, feel the living burning flame of his
               love, savor his pains along with the mysteries of his suffering
               that the world does not appreciate, and like Moses' wife say
               to him, « bridegroom of blood you are for me » (Ex. 4, 26),   518
               the more you can call yourself a bride of the Nazarene Lord.

                    Such  a  happiness,  before  which  the  highest  earthly
               happiness is dust and misery; such a happiness of the virgin
               consecrated to the divine spouse is only the beginning of the
               inconceivable  happiness  which  is  stored  for  her  in  the
               kingdom  of  glory,  if  she  remains  faithful  to  her  vows  and
               perseveres in her religious life... God's word in the mysterious
               book  of  revelation  lifts  up  a  curtain  to  shave  the  future
               mystery  of  glory  and  happiness,  telling  us  that  the  virgins
               consecrated to God are privileged souls around the throne of
               the immaculate lamb,]]></page><page Index="519"><![CDATA[Jesus Christ, singing a new song that others cannot sing. O
               daughter, how the spouse will welcome you when you pass
               from  the  night  of  this  world  to  the  everlasting  day  of  his
               kingdom! When the angels will tell you at the end of your life:
               « Behold! The spouse is coming! » , your lamp will be full of
               the tail of the good works. Oh, what a splendor will gird you in
               the kingdom of glory! What precious crowns will be placed on
               your  head!  What  joy  will  flood  you,  what  flood  of  purest
               celestial  pleasure  will  enrapture  you  forever!  Then,  you  will
               bless forever the most generous love that chose you from the
               thousands  who  were  more  worthy  than  you  to  enter  the
               religious life, you will bless the moment you said good-bye to
               your parents, friends, and birth-place in order to embrace a
               humble, mortified, contradicted, fatiguing life!

                    Labor!  Sacrifice!  But,  what  labor,  what  sacrifice  very
               different from the ones the world demands of its followers or
               its victims! In the house of the Lord, his words « the yoke I will
               give you is easy, and the load I will put on you is light » (Mt.
               11, 30), come true! Everything turns out to be gentle and light
               in  the  religious  life,  because  everything  is  sprinkled  by  the   519
               interior  sweetness  of  grace  and  love  and  enhanced  by  the
               delightful practices of piety; everything is full of the will which
               seeks to please the celestial spouse, and of the hope of being
               rewarded in heaven (Speech, 1908).


                               3. LET US BE FAITHFUL

                    I  raise  my  voice  to  pass  from  the  canticle  of  joy  and
               delight  to  the  mournful  woes  of  divine  threats!  The  spouse
               who  chose  you  is  sweet,  gentle,  lovable,  but  she  is  also
               terrible and dreadful as the apostle says, « God is indeed a
               destroying fire » (Hebr. 12, 29). The spouse who chose]]></page><page Index="520"><![CDATA[you  for  his  mystical  wedding,  despite  your  unworthiness,
               demands  of  you  a  perfect  response  and  faithfulness  to  his
               call. Woe to you, if you are negligent! The more mercy he had
               on  you,  the  more  he  will  punish  you.  Then,  the  following
               words of the gospel which decided your call,  « Two women
               will be at the mill grinding meal: one will be taken away, the
               other will be left behind » (Mt. 24, 41), will burden you with
               complete ruin. Like Ahasuerus who rejected his wife Vasti for
               a  slight  disobedience  and  chose  the  humble,  charming
               Esther, so Jesus Christ will do with you, if you are unfaithful
               and disobedient. He will reject you, and will choose another to
               replace  you.  This  terrible  inversion  changes  the  roles
               fatefully.  You  will  be  the  abandoned,  the  rejected  from  the
               house of the Lord, the one given to perdition, while the other
               will rise to the mystical wedding of the everlasting king. May
               no  one  of  you  incur  such  a  great  misfortune,  dearest
               daughters: be vigilant and faithful brides of your divine groom
               (Ibiden)!

                       Please stand firm on your good will, and the grace of   520
               God will not fail you. The continuous prayers of the brethren
               as  well  as  the  exhortations,  the  rules,  and other assistance
               will help you; but you must be resolute, strong, and constant.
               Do not deceive yourselves by thinking of enjoying satisfaction
               and pleasure, but think of embracing penance and sacrifice. If
               you wish consolations, these will be the ones coming from the
               cross, because the cross has a secret joy... May you be able
               to suffer some trouble, opposition, mortification, and sacrifice
               for  Jesus,  our  supreme  goodness.  Be  sure  that  the  joy
               gushing out of the cross surpasses the world's pleasures; that
               the  sacrifices  you  undertake  in  order  to  please  God,  to  be
               holy  and  to  save  souls,  include  a  joy  beyond  all
               understanding. Most faithful is God, who chose you. He asks
               you to carry his cross. He himself places it on your]]></page><page Index="521"><![CDATA[shoulders. He sometimes overcharges it to make it felt, but if
               you are faithful, he will give you the consolations, the joy, and
               the  peace  which  are  an  anticipation  of  the  eternal  reward
               (Speech, Oct. 24, 1909). (1)


                             4. THE DOORS OF DECLINE

                    To help the superior to prevent decline, we indicate the
               doors  through  which  decline  enters  a  community;  it
               sometimes enters through one person by the hellish enemy's
               help.

                    1.  Neglecting  the  holy  meditation  by  not  sharing  the
               morning meditation or by giving up the daily one on the mast
               holy  Passion  of  our  Lard  Jesus  Christ,  is  the  first  door  of
               decline.  The  faithlessness  in  spiritual  readings  and  the
               emission of them also belongs to this door. The superior will
               see  to  it  that  the  Religious  attend  the  daily  meditation,  and
               when someone is unable to make it in the appointed time, he
               will later be provided with a proper time.                521

                    2.  Receiving  Holy  Communion  without  the  proper
               dispositions is the second doer, somehow hidden, and which
               causes  saddest  results,  especially  when  one  receives  the
               Eucharist with many defects and voluntary venial sins! When
               a  person  commits  voluntary  sins,  gives  bad  examples,  is
               distracted, and indifferent; when this person receives the Holy
               Communion  in  such  a  state  of  conscience,  be  grows
               lukewarm day by day, becomes more unobservant, declines
               in  a  short  time,  and  makes  others  follow  his  example.  The
               superior  shall  be  very  attentive  that  all  receive  Holy
               Communion with the due dispositions of remote preparation -
               avoidance  of  voluntary  sins,  even  venial  ones  -  and  of
               immediate preparation;]]></page><page Index="522"><![CDATA[he  wild  see  to  it  that  a  proper  thanksgiving  will  never  be
               omitted.

                    3.  Lukewarmth  in  the  spirit  of  vocal  prayer. This  is  the
               third  door  of  decline.  The  superior  will  prevent  it  by  seeing
               that  each  person  says  the  prayers  established  by  the  rule
               with a contrite, quiet voice.

                    4. The key of the fourth door of decline is in the hands of
               the mute devil; this door is the grumbling against the institute,
               the  superiors,  and  their  orders.  It  creeps  into  the  people's
               souls in order to lead them astray, to make them rebellious,
               and  then  hushes  up  everything.  In  such  a  situation  even
               those  who  seem  observant  may  hush  up  the  increasing
               infractions which they see, or listen to, or know. These people
               are  the  institute's  betrayers,  not  the  faithful sons!  How  very
               attentive the superior must be! He shall teach and exhort his
               subjects on purpose. In case of suspicions, he will question
               the  most  faithful  members,  by  asking  them  whether  they
               know of any infractions or not. Above all, following our Lord's
               suggestion, « Pray and be vigilant » the superior will pray and   522
               will be vigilant to prevent the devil from sowing dissension in
               the elect harvest. The Holy Spirit tells each superior: « Know
               your  flocks'  condition  well,  take  good  care  of  your  herds;
               since riches do not last for ever, wealth is not handed down
               from age to age » (Prov. 27, 23-24). (2)

                    5. To lead everything in perfect observance and to avoid
               lukerwarmness in the community, each superior will carefully
               correct  the  little  defects,  considering  them  as  momentous.
               Woe  to  the  superior  who  begins  neglecting  same  little
               defects, passing over them in silence, almost approving them
               through  his  silence  and  indifference  or  by  committing  them
               himself! Bit by bit, the destroying]]></page><page Index="523"><![CDATA[fire will be lighted! The superior must remember that the Holy
               Spirit says, « He who despises trifles will sink down little by
               little  »  (Ecclesiasticus  19,  1).  When  a  person  disregards  a
               little  defect,  it  becomes  habitual  gangrene,  increases,  and
               pollutes  others,  unless  it  is  corrected.  That person  declines
               spiritually,  receives  Holy  Communion  with  indifference,  and
               does  not  profit  by  it  as  he  should.  The  grace  of  the  Lord
               increases,  temptations  grow,  hidden  passions  rouse  again,
               seep  in  the  spirit,  and  try  to  retake  their  place;  distractions
               assail the soul, the spirit of prayer dissipates, and that person
               falls from the venial sins into the grave ones! This, however,
               is not the worst evil! At once, that defect is imitated by others
               who  achieve  the  same  results;  the  fire  bursts  into  flames!
               Guilty  before  God  for  having  passed  over  his  subjects'
               defects, the superior declines first. Punishment results in his
               becoming worse than the others, and he is a model of bad
               examples  to them! Too many  good,  observant  communities
               were ruined this way! The superior, therefore, must prevent
               and  repress  the  little  defects  to  ward  off  decline  from  the
               community.  He  will  always  remember  that  our  Lord  Jesus
               Christ said: « I tell you this: on the judgment day everyone will   523
               have  to  give  account  of  every  useless  word  he  has  ever
               spoken » (Mt. 12, 36).

                    6.  Vocations.  As  to  vocations,  they  are  of  great
               importance in warding off lukewarmth and in maintaining the
               exact observance in the community. The superiors, therefore,
               will  carefully  prevent  the  unproved  vocations  from  entering
               the  order.  Keeping  in  mind  that  the  devil  induces  same
               persons to enter the institute in order to ruin it, the superiors
               will  be  vigilant  and  strong  sentinels  in order  to discover  the
               hellish snares and to repel the hellish attacks vigorously.

                    7. A big door of decline is angry talk. Meekness and]]></page><page Index="524"><![CDATA[calm help the hearts to be united in charity, whereas anger
               destroys mutual charity. Angry talk is barn of the heart prone
               to anger, but hard to mercy. It is, like a polluting disease. Woe
               to the superior who is prone to anger and to hateful talk even
               about ordinary things. The community will follow his behavior,
               destroying the union of hearts! He must be meekest in words
               and  action;  even  when  he  raises,  his  voice  to  speak  with
               vigor, his heart must be always calm and self-controlled.

                    8. Decrease of holy, mutual love is a mast fateful door of
               general  decline!  The  superior  will  be  very  attentive  in  this
               matter. First, he will love his subjects much, much, much with
               tender affection, showing it by facts. He will often remember
               what our Lord Jesus Christ said with pressing invitation: « A
               new commandment I give you: love one another. As I have
               loved you, so you must love one another » (Jn. 13, 34), as
               well as: « if you have love for one another, then all will know
               that you are my disciples » (Jn. 13, 35). He will foster spiritual
               readings on mutual charity, paying attention to the practice of
               it. Such practice consists:
                                                                         524
                    a)  In  sympathizing  and  consoling  the  afflicted  as  much
               as obedience allows;

                    b) In easing the brother of his burden by helping him;

                    c) In rejoicing for the brethren's good;

                    d) In praying sincerely for one another, especially when
               someone is in danger of losing his virtue or his vocation. The
               Religious  who  cries  before  God  to  obtain  grace  for  the
               tottering  brother  will  became  most  acceptable,  whereas  the
               community's  indifference  before  a  tottering  vocation  is  very
               pitiable! In such a case, the superior may]]></page><page Index="525"><![CDATA[tell the community to pray for an intention, without specifying
               it.

                    The superior will also take care that love for one another
               be  love  of  charity  with  no  personal  sympathy  or  friendship,
               but  each  one  will  love  everyone  equally.  He  will  love  all,
               especially the needy, and when they are humble in heart, he
               will  show  his  love  for  them  publicly.  Love  of  charity  also
               consists  in  having  mercy  on  the  sick,  and  in  serving  them
               heartily.

                    e)  Holy  love  consists  in  bearing  the  faults  of  and  in
               excusing  the  brethren,  when  they  give  some  offense.  The
               superior will keep a special watch on this topic, which we call
               door opened by the devil to weaken the whole community.

                    When  a  Religious  is  touchy  by  nature,  unless  he
               amends,  he  is  rude  to  others,  or  he  charges  them  of  some
               offense,  or  he  is  lacking  in  charity  and  courtesy.  In  such  a
               case  the  devil  is  on  the  look-out  to  infuse  indignation  and
               grudge in the offended person! Fateful moment! If that person   525
               yields  to  the  temptation  by  lack  of  virtue,  the  hearts  are
               divided,  and  grumble,  suspicion,  and  bad  example  follow.
               Here, the superior will take care of the offended person rather
               than of the offender. He will appease him by reminding him of
               the holy principles and by praying for him. On the other hand,
               he  will  do  his  best  so  that  the  offender  acknowledge  his
               wrong and apologize so as to settle everything in peace. We
               shave to cut down disorders at their very beginning.

                    9. Infringement of silence is another door the devil opens
               to slacken and to invade the community. The superior will be
               very watchful on it. He first will observe silence perfectly, and
               will demand observance of the perfect and of the moderate
               silence, and avoid the hellish deceit of]]></page><page Index="526"><![CDATA[correcting the infringement of silence on the spot by raising
               his voice. It would be as to throw straw on the fire to blow it
               out.  Instead,  when  he  wants  to  correct  the  infringement  of
               silence on the spot, the most suitable and efficacious means
               is to demand silence by reproaching by signs, or in a very low
               voice.  This  demand  or  reproach  is  also  a  very  effective
               example of observance. Morning silence must be observed in
               a  special  way,  because  it  gives  the  tune  to  the  whole  day.
               Talking before the holy mass and the most Holy Communion
               causes dissipation.

                    10.  Each  superior  will  see  to  it  that  each  rule  be
               observed.  To  avoid  decline,  he  will  be  responsible  for  the
               community's  schedule,  will  equip  the  building  to  the  com-
               munity's needs, and will provide his subjects with everything
               they need to insure neatness and order.

                    11. If someone is the cause of decline, the superior will
               do  his  best  to  correct  him  gently  or  bluntly,  beginning  with
               praying to our Lord and to the most holy Virgin. If at the end,   526
               the  Religious  appears  unwilling  to  amend,  the  superior  will
               defer the case to the major superior (R.S.).



                                        NOTES

                   (1) The young sisters must always keep in mind the rules and the
               promises they have made. By remembering the retreat where they have
               been formed, they will be spiritually united to the mother house, and will
               commend the institute and its members to the Lord in order that it may
               improve, be firm, and acceptable to God for the greater consolation of
               Jesus'  Heart.  While  working  to  educate  the  others,  they  will  strive  to
               sanctify  themselves  according  to  the  spirit  of  their  institute,  which
               consists in the zeal for the most holy Heart of Jesus' interests. They will
               strive to achieve the virtues,]]></page><page Index="527"><![CDATA[seeking  Jesus  alone  and  longing  for  holy  profession  in

                          HELPING THE INSTITUTE DEVELOP

                   I  will  always  nurture  a  loving  affection  for  my  own
               institute, whose interests I will consider as mine, striving
               to  make  it  known  to  the  people.  I  will  also  help  it  to
               develop through my feeble capacity, work, sacrifice, and
               humble  prayers  as  well  as  by  incessantly  seeking  my
               own sanctification of the brethren.

                   To  win  good  vocations,  I  will  pray  to  God  and  will
               seize the opportunities to attract those according to the
               Heart  of  Jesus,  who  are  suited  for  the  Daughters  of
               Divine Zeal's institute. I will jealously and faithfully keep
               the secrets of the institute and of its members, even In
               case I should leave the order for a just reason, just as I
               have said above.


                                                                         529

                 1. LET US RENEW OURSELVES DOING OUR UTMOST

                    My little children! God entrusted a great treasure to us!
               But, we must fear of being deprived of it, unless we observe
               well the religious life.

                 The time has come to spread the command of the Rogate;
               God entrusted this mission to us. But, we must observe the
               religious life, lest this mission perish in our hands. What did l
               say?  Will  it  perish?  Not  at  all!  If  we  do  not  observe  thus
               religious life, we will perish, but the Rogate will triumph! God
               will snatch out of our hands this treasure, and will give it to
               others. He will rent the vineyard out to other tenants, who will
               give him his share of the harvest at the right time (Mt. 21, 41).
               Oh,  little  children!  Haw  can  we  think  of  such  a  misfortune
               without]]></page><page Index="530"><![CDATA[dying  of  pain?  Oh,  we  will  never  became  unworthy  of  so a
               great  ineffable  mercy.  To  be  worthy  of  it,  however,  implies
               that we must be perfect Religious through the observance of
               the  vows  and  the  rules,  because  advertisement  and  pious
               union are inadequate if we do not belong totally to Jesus, if
               we  do  not  form  an  observant  community  dearest  to  the
               Hearts  of  Jesus  and Mary  through  the  practice  of the  vows
               and the virtues!

                    Unless we are men of prayer, mortified, detached, lovers
               of  Jesus  and  Mary  as  well  as  of  the  cross  and  sacrifice;
               unless we are sober in words, obedient, observant, and men
               of  interior  life,  our  writing,  printing,  and  being  zealous  are
               useless. But, if we are observant Religious, God will bless the
               little  seed  and  the  vocations  will  come.  Ah,  let  us  renew
               ourselves,  doing  our  utmost!  Let  us  say:  Now  I  begin

                           2. CULTURE OF THE VOCATIONS                   530

                    The  order  of  the  Rogationist  Fathers  by  the  Heart  of
               Jesus  will  aim  at  winning  holy  vocations  to  religious  and
               priestly life for the divine glory, the good of the whole Church,
               and for souls.

                    To achieve this goal, they will make unceasing petitions
               to God in order to win good workers to the holy Church, will
               spread this beneficial prayer, and will acknowledge that more
               worthy  persons  can  win  this  grace  of  graces,  this  mercy  of
               mercies better than they do. While praying for vacations and
               while  spreading  the  vocation  prayer,  they  will  have  the
               following two intentions:

                    First: that the most holy Heart of Jesus create, raise, and
               send  out  apostolical  persons,  holy  priests  according  to  his
               Heart, and elect workers of the mystical harvest]]></page><page Index="531"><![CDATA[to the whole Church, to the dioceses, to the religious orders,
               and to the sacred congregations.

                    Second:  that  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  raise  and
               send out blessed youth and priests according to his Heart to
               the institute of the Rogationist Fathers by the Heart of Jesus,
               as  the  one  to  which the  divine unintelligible mercy and  the,
               Spirit that « blows wherever he wishes » (Jn. 3, 8) gave the
               understanding  and  the  mission  of  the  divine  word:  «  Pray,
               therefore, to the owner of the harvest. »

                    The  Rogationists  will  combine  prayers,  intentions,  and
               works.  When  qualified  Rogationists  are  available,  and  the
               bishops  ask  for  them,  they  will  commit  themselves  to  the
               culture and to the education of the clerics in the seminaries,
               reputing this work as the best of their ministry.

                    To attract holy vocations to the Rogationist institute, the
               order will aim at cultivating piety in the youth, at educating the
               children  in  Christian  doctrine,  and  at  forming  youth  groups,   531
               under the protection of the most holy Heart of Jesus, the most
               holy Virgin, St. Joseph, St. Anthony of Padua, and St. Louis.
               The festive oratories along with play activities, theater, walks
               etc. are also a very efficient means, but holy confession and
               Communion are the prominent means.

                    The order will be very attentive in cultivating its vocations
               in the Lord, helping them persevere. The common and private
               prayer  of  the  priests  along  with  their  good  example  in
               observance  and  practice  of  holy  virtues  helps  the  youth,
               because  they  can  hardly  be  formed  when  they  are
               surrounded by bad examples and indifference of the chiefs.
               Therefore, the order must pay full attention to form the youth
               in piety and religious virtues, and will help those of talent to
               study to become priests of the order. The superiors will take
               care of them, paying heed]]></page><page Index="532"><![CDATA[that  their  whole  education  be  in  the  institute,  and  will  avoid
               sending  them  to  the  seminary's  school  together  with  the
               diocesan  clerics.  Do  not  be  hasty  in  ordering  them  priests;
               when they have completed their education and are founded
               well in religious virtues, then they are ready for the ordination
               to  the  priesthood.  The  superiors  will  also  see  that  the
               candidates  for  the  priesthood  give  no  priority  to  study  over
               piety  and  to  education  over  virtue,  but  base  themselves  on
               holy humility, prayer, and internal virtue (C.R.).

                    The  chance  of  vocations  from  the  day  school  for  girls
               turns out to be very profitable. The drawing of the girls to holy
               vacation is surely a pious activity, but the sisters must be very
               cautious,  evading  to  pressure  the  girls  even  by  saying  that
               the sisters mean to call them to religious life. It would alarm
               their  parents.  Such  a  work  is  to  be  done  indirectly  through
               spiritual education, piety, and pure holy affection.

                    a)  The  spiritual  education  developed  on  the  basis  of
               Christian doctrine, sacred history, and spiritual readings leads
               to holy vacation indirectly. To teach religion effectively to the   532
               girls,  the  sisters  should  attend  four-five  year  courses  of
               catechism,  history  criticism,  principles  of  theology,  (2)  and
               Sacred  Scripture.  At  the  end  of  the  courses,  a  team  of
               learned, pious priests headed by the Ordinary would confer a
               diploma  after  the  examination.  Thus,  the  sisters  would  be
               qualified to form the students through strong, sound principles
               of religion. (3)

                    b)  Piety:  the  sisters  will  form  the  Daughters  of  Im-
               maculate  Mary's  pious  union  and  will  be  responsible  for  it,
               because  various  vocations  may  rise  spontaneously  when  it
               flourishes. The reception of the sacraments, especially of the
               Holy Communion with the due dispositions]]></page><page Index="533"><![CDATA[and  thanksgiving,  the  readings  from  ascetic  books,  the
               meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  on
               the last truths, the devotions in the months of May and June,
               the  feasts  of  our  Lord  and  the  most  holy  Virgin,  etc...  raise
               vocations without fail!

                    c)  Affection:  the  sisters'  pure,  holy  love  for  the  girls
               exercises  a  potent  influence  on  them  to  follow  the  same
               vocation, because love tends by itself to make lovers alike; a
               girl  who  is  loved  in  a  holy  manner  by  the  sisters  aims  at
               becoming like them.

                    Vocations from the orphans. The sisters will never speak
               of  vocation  to  the  orphans  in  order  to  attract  them  to
               becoming  sisters,  on  the  contrary  they  will  say  indirectly  to
               the orphans that they would be unworthy of it. If someone of
               the  orphans  shows  signs  of  vocation,  the  sister  will  not
               cultivate it immediately, but will let it develop by itself, praying
               to the Lord. When a wise, pious, good natured, meek orphan
               is  detached  from  the  relatives  and  from  the  world  and  is
               affectionate to the institute; when she is introduced well in the   533
               study and the works, and shows signs of vocation, the sisters
               will  pray  and  take  advice  before  submitting the  case  to  the
               mother general in order to receive the orphan in the religious
               community.


                          3. DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORDER

                    The mother superior will carefully form the sisters' spirit
               and mind to improve their skill in good works, the execution,
               of  their  office,  and  everything  that  helps  them  to  become
               perfect sisters.

                    The  mother  superior  must  be  convinced  that  when  the
               spiritual, intellectual, and domestic formation is well done, our
               Lord continues sending good vocations, because]]></page><page Index="534"><![CDATA[the institute becomes an ark of salvation and of sanctification
               for the congregants. When the vocations grow in number and
               the  youth  are  well  formed,  they  will  be  ready  for  new
               foundations, avoiding to wish them for ambition, levity, vanity,
               and  vainglory,  which  would  prevent  the  Lord  from  blessing
               them.

                    Ready as soldiers at the command of the headquarter,
               the mother superior and the sisters will be ready to found new
               communities when the will of the Lord manifests itself. They
               will  work  in  the  holy  Church  and  in  the  mystical  harvest  of
               God for the divine glory, for the consolation of the most holy
               Heart of Jesus, and for the salvation of souls.

                    When we are invited to found a new house, the invitation
               must be, somehow delayed by writing and re-writing in order
               to  know  the  necessary  information  about  the  distance,  the
               means of communication, the country or the city, the place,
               what the people offer and demand, the income they promise,
               etc.; we must know beforehand what is necessary to the new
               house before giving our definite answer.                  534

                    After  obtaining  the  information,  the  sisters  need  some
               more  time  for  prayer;  therefore,  the  community  will  begin
               novenas, prayers, and celebration of masses for a least one
               month.

                    To  check  the  written  information,  the  superior  or  two
               experienced sisters will go to see the place of the foundation.
               If  they  consider  the  proposal  acceptable,  they  may  give  a
               favorable  opinion  to  the  persons  responsible  for  the
               foundation, without entering into any engagement. Once back
               home, they will report everything to the mother superior.

                    When  by  divine  help  the  new  house  may  start  and  be
               promising, the council gathers again to discuss the]]></page><page Index="535"><![CDATA[proposal and the convention in order to find out the best way
               to achieve the aim of the foundation.

                    Before accepting a house, the superiors have to form an
               idea of the actual and of the eventual income for the sisters'
               livelihood and for the maintenance of the house, considering
               the furniture, the remodeling, the laboratories, etc.

                    Fixed income for the whole maintenance of the orphans
               cannot be claimed, because we have to fulfill the gap by work
               and divine providence, in which we have to trust. On the other
               hand, we won't tempt God by founding orphanages in places
               where,  humanly  speaking,  there  is  little  or  no  hope  to
               succeed. We must follow the right middle way in everything.

                    As for the day schools, which require four or five sisters,
               their  foundation  and  maintenance  are  easier,  unless  the
               buildings  are  unsuitable;  in  such  a  case,  remodeling,
               enlargement,  and  the  like  must  be  taken  into  consideration
               before making the contract.
                                                                         535
                    While  considering  the  environmental  suitability  for  the
               foundation's success, you have also to think of the institutions
               already existent  in  that  place,  which  live by contributions.  If
               the people are committed to them, it would be unwise to put
               an additional institution without having some sure income.

                    Can foundations be started without invitation? Of course
               they  can,  they  even  should  when  qualified  sisters  had  at
               disposal  financial  means  to  buy  suitable  buildings,  to  open
               schools or laboratories in cities or towns, to receive orphans,
               etc. On the contrary case it is better waiting for an invitation in
               order  to  profit  by  convenient  terms;  nevertheless,  if  despite
               our good will and trust in divine providence we are notable to
               meet the request, the invitation is to be declined.]]></page><page Index="536"><![CDATA[When an orphanage ends its activity, the sisters will do
               their best to take the orphans, at least the more affectionate
               and promising, to other orphanages of the order. If children
               are all good, the sisters will provide to take them all.


                               4. WHICH FOUNDATIONS

                    Which  foundations  can  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal
               foster?

                    The  sacred,  expressive  name  of  Daughters  of  Divine
               Zeal  compels  us  to  promote  the  divine  Heart  of  Jesus'
               interests,  that  is  to  say,  whatsoever  charitable  institution,
               because  the  zeal  is  the  charity's  fervor.  As  special  sup-
               porters of the divine command: « Pray, therefore, etc., » by
               God's  help  and  our  good  will  we  have  to  be  energetic
               workers in the mystical harvest, in any field of the spiritual
               and temporal culture in order to win souls to the most holy
               Heart of Jesus for his glory and consolation.
                                                                         536

                    The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  can  open  orphanages,
               kindergartens,  asylums  for  the  poor,  hospitals,  laboratories
               for  outside  students,  any  charitable  foundation  for  girls,
               boarding  schools  from  elementary  schools  to  colleges,
               depending on their financial means and on the number of the
               qualified sisters.

                    Do we exclude the foundations in little towns?

                    Suppose that an orphanage or day school in a little town
               is  guaranteed  by  means  or  by  development  of  work  and
               industries. The foundation should be preferred, even though
               the little town may have another institution which is not run by
               sisters.  Our  Lord  wants  us  to  operate  for  the  good  of  the
               souls who are more in need, and perhaps more docile, than
               those who live in big cities or are daughters to the great of
               this world.]]></page><page Index="537"><![CDATA[We repeat: we must avoid seeking to found any house
               by ambition, seeking big cities for a worldly reputation or for
               large  profits;  on  the  contrary,  we  must  work  for  our  Lord
               Jesus Christ's glory and for the poor who are riot cared for by
               other institutions. Do the missionary sisters go to the infidels'
               lands  for  their  oven  convenience?  A  foundation  which
               operates  in  a humble,  poor  town  is  a  true mission  pleasing
               the good shepherd Jesus, who seeks here and there, on the
               mountains and in the fields the dispersed abandoned sheep,
               which  are  easy  prey  for  the  hellish  wolves.  If  the  sisters  of
               such  a  foundation  are  faithful  to  their  vocation  and  rule,
               always  living  in  the  original  fervor  and  in  the  spirit  of
               sanctification, improving themselves and the souls entrusted
               to them, these sisters will be blessed and be helped by the
               Lord.

                    Both the mother superior and the superior general must
               pay careful attention to all this.


                          5. CHRONICLE OF THE HOUSE AND                  537
                              OF THE DIVINE BENEFITS

                    Each house will write its own chronicle in a special book,
               beginning with its foundation, with the plans, and everything
               preceding  the  formal  entrance  of  the  community  in  it.  The
               chronicle  will  describe  the  entrance,  the  number  of  the
               sisters, and their first acquaintances. Then, the daybook will
               register  any  event,  such  as:  change  of  things,  the  granted
               graces,  the  notable  visits,  the  troubles,  the  transfer  of  the
               sisters  or  vocations,  and  anything  worth  mentioning.  When
               nothing special occurred, the writer will write after the date:
               ordinary course of business or the contracted form O. C. B.
               The  historiographer  will  pay  attention  to  date  any  event,
               sometimes]]></page><page Index="538"><![CDATA[recording  even  the  hours,  abut  everything  will  be  narrated
               briefly,  the  special  events  excepted.  The  chronicle  of  the
               house is a coefficient of the house's existence. Outstanding
               actions of virtues will be also recorded.


                    The mother  superior  will  spay  careful  attention  that  the
               historiographer record the special graces, the divine mercies,
               and the spiritual or temporal benefits concerning the house.
               She  can  do  it  in  the  same  book  or  in  another  one.  If  the
               record is taken .in the chronicle of the house, the record will
               be headed by the title: divine Mercy or Divine Grace or Divine
               Benefit. The historiographer will record the granted graces in
               details,  and  will  write  the  date.  At  the  end  of  the  year,  the
               records  of  the  special  graces  will  be  read  during  the
               thanksgiving  triduo.  It  is  praiseworthy  to  record  the  divine
               benefits in a special book. In such a case, the special grace
               will be recorded so: « Today, special grace from the Lord, see
               book of the divine benefits, year... page... »

                    The records must be preserved jealously in the archives   538
               to be at the disposal of our institute's future generations; thus,
               the  present  and  the  future  houses  will  nurture  great,
               continuous gratitude to the divine infinite goodness not only
               for  the  general  but  also  for  the  special  graces  which  were
               granted to each house. Likewise, following her devotion, each
               sister will record or keep in mind the memories of the special
               graces, for which she feels obliged toward the divine amorous
               lover, Jesus (S.D.D.Z.).

                    Some  events,  or  special  graces,  or  preservations  from
               perils  and  evils  must  be  remembered  during  the  year.  The
               commemoration will be done this way: the notable events will
               be written in the calendar, and will be read at refectory on the
               eve of their anniversary (S.D.D.Z.). (4)]]></page><page Index="539"><![CDATA[6. THE ROGATIONIST BULLETIN

                    Every  two  or  three  months,  the  priests  residing  at  the
               mother house in Messina publish a Bulletin to keep alive and
               foster the interest for the institute through the remark of the
               main  events  and  through  the  remembrance  of  the  sacred
               memories and the particular traditions. It would be unpleasant
               if the houses gave little regard to the bulletin that the young
               priests  are running  with  love,  labor,  and  sacrifice  under  the
               wise guide of our most Rev. Canon Vitale. For that reason we
               exhort  the  mother  superior  or  vicar  of  each  house  and
               dependencies to make the religious community read it in the
               most  suitable  time;  the  orphans  will  not  share  this  reading.
               We  exhort  to  pay  a  full  attention  to  it,  nurturing  an  always
               more  affection  to  our  institute  that  the  Lord  has  blessed  in
               many ways. We are sure that the Lord will do even more, on
               condition that all of us are faithful, which we want for ever at
               the cost of our blood and life.

                    To  foster  fervor  and  union  among  the  houses,  each
               house may report; to the bulletin its main events, the mercies   539
               of the Lord, the good results, the new developments, and the
               like (Circular, Jan. 1925).


                                          NOTES
                   (1) «The order is made of priests and lay-brothers living under the
               same rule and with the same advantages, but with different duties.
                   As members of the same religious family, the lay-brothers are to be
               esteemed  as  much  as  the  priests,  profiting  by  the  same  spiritual  and
               temporal goods. Save the personal fulfillment of duty, they will share the
               acts in common, but in places different from the ones assigned to the
               priests. The lay-brothers will be humble and will glory in serving all of the
               Lord's  house,  accomplishing  their  duty  with  care  and  applying
               themselves to arts and crafts. If someone is]]></page><page Index="540"><![CDATA[inclined to fine arts  or  to  mechanics, he  will cultivate  them  in  the
               Lord,  because  fine  arts  are  the  splendor  of  the  religious  garb,  and
               mechanics is of great help to the institute. As to music, the lay brothers
               will  not study  it without  a special  permission,  which  will be  granted  in
               exceptional cases* (C.R.).
                   (2)  Regarding   this   subject,   our   padre   wrote:    «St.   Thomas'
               Summa  Teologica,  traslated  into  Italian  and  summarized  in  questions
               and answers, Marietti edition, Turin, may be of help.»
                   (3)  Today, school of religion for the sisters is obligatory; it was not
               in our padre's time. He was a forerunner.
                   (4)  After   noting  defaults   on   this   matter,   our   padre   wrote
               a circular on July 14, 1915, saying that he was «obliged to command by
               obedience    a      topic  of    importance    for    the    moral    quality    of      a
               religious  foundation.»  He  continued:  «It  is  long  since  I  am  recom-
               mending to write the house chronicle and it has never been made; now
               I  command  the   mother  superior of  this   house  or  her  vicar to
               prepare  a  book  of  foolscap  paper,»  to  date  it  and  to  write  the  story,
               following these rules:
                   1)  As to the  present  chronicle, the mother superior herself or a
               sister will write the daily events before going to sleep.
                   2)  As  to  the   past   chronicle,   the   mother  superior  will   gather,
               note, and write the chief events of the  house  beginning  from  the time
               of  its foundation. She  may question  the sisters who  are acquainted
               whit it.                                                  540
                   3)  Please write the date of the past events precisely.
                   4)    Leaving  out  present  and  past  trifles,  write  the  chief  events;
               meantime  each  sister  will  pray  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  to  give  her
               enlightenment.
                   The Daughters of the Sacred Side of Jesus were also told to write
               the house chronicle.
                   « I warmly recommend the chronicle of the house. Write it as soon
               as  possible,  noting  its  foundation  date,  its  progress,  difficulties,
               tribulations, persecutions, and want. Write the sisters by their full name,
               the  transfer  of  directions,  the  day  school  along  With  Its  fortunes,  the
               taking  of  the  habit,  and  everything  until  you  up-date  it.  Later, you will
               write the chief events of every week. When I call upon you by the Lord's
               help, you will let me read it. Please use a filing cabinet for documents,
               titles,  mains  letters,  notes,  etc.  All  these  things  form  the  houses,  and
               God blesses them because he likes order» (D.S.S.).]]></page><page Index="541"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXXI

                                    INFORMATION

                    I  recognize  as  exact  and  indispensable  the  institute's
               rule that demands of the congregants to faithfully refer to the
               superiors  the  brethren's  defects  and  anything  which  is
               spiritually or materially harmful to even one person. For that
               reason I promise to be most faithful in referring everything to
               the  superiors,  but  when  the  matter  is  about  the  brethren's
               defects, I will observe these rules:

                    1. I wild refer the serious defects and the habitual ones,
               either  hidden  or  unobserved,  even  though  they  are  not
               serious.

                    2.  When  I  am  able  to  remedy  the  brethren's  hidden,
               irrelevant, unobserved defects, I will do it through the humble
               brotherly correction once or twice. If I do not succeed in it, I
               will refer it to the superior.
                                                                         541
                    3. I will never inform for personal reasons or for grudge,
               but  for  charity  and  with  pure  intention,  avoiding
               over-statements or addition.

                    As to the rule of information, I will do my duty regardless
               of  human respect,  or  fear  of  displeasing  the  brother  and  of
               losing his affection and esteem. (1)

                    The aspirants are not allowed to charge each other with
               personal  trifles,  but  are  obliged  by  obedience  to  give
               information  to  the  superior  in  these  two  following  cases:  1)
               when  they  know  something  which  is  harmful  to  the
               community or to a person; 2) when they are questioned]]></page><page Index="542"><![CDATA[by the superior about  conversations or facts they may have
               about others in question.

                    These rules are so important that the aspirant who does
               not inform the superior about anything which hiddenly harms
               the persons or the institute, will be considered as an unfaithful
               traitor,  because  he  hushes  up  in  agreement  with  the  devil,
               allowing the trouble to grow in proportion. If a youth conceals
               something to the superior who questions him, he is no longer
               an  aspirant  to  religious  life,  but  an  aspirant  to  a  gang  of
               malefactors,  and  is  worthy  of  being  punished  with  rigor
               immediately,  and  even  of  being  expelled.  The  aspirants,
               therefore, are obliged to answer sincerely to the superior, and
               when  they  know  of  infractions  of  rules  and obligations  they
               are bound an duty to inform him (R.A.). (2)

                    The  congregants'  duty  to  faithfully  refer  to  the  superior
               the serious inconveniences that might harm the community or
               even  one  person  is  a  chief  point  of  discipline.  The
               probationers  must  know  that  when  the  hellish  enemy  plots
               against the people, he demands perfect silence: this is what   542
               we call the mute devil. Charity instead urges us to inform the
               superior,  who  is  able  and  must  remedy  the  situation.  The
               information,  however,  must  be  done  with  charity  and  with
               purest intention. Light violations of this rule, which can cause
               serious damage, are considered serious inconveniences. If a
               probationer  comes  to  know  that  he  has  been  charged  with
               something, he must not become angry nor complain. Getting
               angry  or  complaining  about  such  a  matter  is  a  symptom  of
               deplorable obstinacy in one's own makeup; on the contrary,
               he  must  be  grateful  toward  the  people  who  informed  the
               superior (R.P.).

                    Each congregant is strictly obliged to faithfully inform the
               superiors about any infraction in the community, any damage
               even to one person, the fellow's defect which]]></page><page Index="543"><![CDATA[harms him or others, as well as any temptation of decline or
               defection. Everything must be referred faithfully; whoever
               keeps silent about these cases, is a traitor of his own
               religious family.


                    The informer will act for charity's sake as well as for the
               fellow's  and  for  the  whole  community's  good,  but  never  for
               personal  reason.  If  the  fellow  who  is  charged  happens  to
               know the informer, he must be grateful to him, and will even
               take  pleasure  in  what  he  did;  were  he  to  do  otherwise,  he
               would show no religious spirit. But, the superior will act with
               greatest prudence to let the informer remain unknown, while
               acting quickly and strongly to remedy the situation (C.R.).

                    Each  novice  is  obliged  by  obedience  to  inform  the
               mother  superior  about  another's  defects  and  also about  the
               students' actions that require correction. The breaker of this
               rule  is  guilty  of  disobedience.  Only  when  the  matter  is  a
               personal offense, the offended novice may be more reserved.
               As  for  light  faults,  the  novice  may  use  once  or  twice  the   543
               charitable advice, and the novice who is advised will behave
               humbly.  If  he  refuses  the  correction,  the  duty  to  inform  the
               mother  superior  remains.  The  informer,  who  complies  with
               holy obedience in such a case, must behave charitably, only
               aiming  at  helping  the  offending  person  and  the  whole
               community. The novices are recommended to take the rule of
               information do good part, avoiding any complaint about each
               other  and  being  mutually  grateful,  because  the  rule  of
               information is for their good (R.L.P.).

                    By  informing  the  superior,  people  do  not  offend  holy
               charity.  On  the  contrary,  people  offend  justice,  obedience,
               and  charity  by  not  informing  the  superior  (Letter,  April  1,
               1912).

                    Be sure that the leader of a community is practicing]]></page><page Index="544"><![CDATA[charity  when  he  expels  the  subversive;  on  the  contrary,  he
               offends charity when he hesitates to expel them (Letter, May

                   (1)  To   prevail   over   the   mute   devil,   our   padre   ordered
               the following prayer to the most holy Virgin: «O divine, lovable, invisible,
               absolute,   immediate   mother   superior,   Immaculate   Mary,   kneeling
               at your foot, I humbly beg you to forgive me for all the times I was won
               by the mute devil to my own and to others' prejudice, because I did  not
               inform  the superiors.  O  most  holy Virgin,  I  promise  that I will never
               do so again; regardless of human respect  I will inform our padre (or the
               mother superior or the teacher)   about anything which  is harmful  to the
               individuals  or to  the  community.  0   most holy  Mother,  please  help
               me   prevail  over  the   mute  devil  when   I have to talk to the superiors
               or when I have to be silent with my fellow Religious.  Hail  Mary.»
                   (2)   «Knowing  that  the  institute's  rule   commands  us  to  inform
                  the mother superior about the defects of others as well as anything
                  which is harmful to the community or to any  person,  I  promise to
                 conceal  nothing,  being  most faithful  in  referring everything for  the
                 individuals   and   the   community's   sake.   When   I   am   charged
                with something, I will consider it as a great favor, because my brothers
               are  providin  me  with   the  appropriate  admonitions   and   corrections.   544
                 J will also consider these  brothers as  my guardian  angels,  praying
                 that  they  may  inform  the  mother  superior of   the  teacher for  my
                             correction and for God's sake* (D.P.).]]></page><page Index="545"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXXII

                        RELATIONS AMONG THE INSTITUTE'S
                                CLASSES OF PEOPLE

                    Since  the  Institute  has  several  classes  of  persons,
               such as the priests, the brothers, the students, and the
               orphans,  I  promise  to communicate  with these persons
               within  the  bounds  of  the  office  to  which  I  will  be
               appointed by the superiors.

                    I will avoid meddling with matters concerning these
               persons or their office without a legitimate authorization.


                    When  an  orphanage  or  a  school  or  a  laboratory  is
               connected with the institute, or groups of girls gather within it,
               I  will  have  no  relationship  with  the  outside  girls  or  with  the
               orphans or with the students or with the apprentices, and the
               like.  Even  when  I  am  obliged  to  stay  near  them,  I  will  not   545
               watch, nor will I talk, nor will I give them gifts or souvenirs; nor
               will I let them give me messages or will I take errands. When
               someone tries to do so, I will warn her; if the same person
               tries to do so again, I will warn and repulse her, threatening
               her with informing the mother superior; if she persists, I will
               inform the mother superior or the master (D.P.).]]></page><page Index="546"><![CDATA[546]]></page><page Index="547"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXXIII

                            DISCIPLINARY OBSERVANCE

                   I will not receive persons, acquaintances, and friends
               in  the  Institute  without  the  permission,  at  least
               presumed, of the superiors. I will also ask the permission
               of the superior to leave. While outside the Institute, I will
               avoid speaking Idly with other persons, or calling upon
               Individuals without the permission of the superiors, or at
               least without informing them.

                   When I am walking or interacting with people, I will
               avoid curiosity, idle talk, and everything not edifying; on
               the  contrary,  I  will  be  always  In  the  presence  of  God,
               behaving as a priest and as a Religious.


                    1.   DISCIPLINE, SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY
                                                                         547
                    I  recommend  you  to  be  fond  of  discipline,  because  it
               supports  the  community,  and  no  community  can  progress
               without  it.  Discipline  means  observance  of  the  rules,  of  the
               schedule, and of the silence! Rule, Schedule, Silence. What a
               responsibility  they  take  upon  themselves  those  daughters
               who  disregard  discipline,  causing  others  to  do  the  same!
               From now on, each of you may be like a bee making honey in
               silence. Purposely, recommend yourselves to the most holy
               Virgin Mary and to your father and patron St. Joseph (Letter,
               May 13, 1889).

                    May  no  one  disregard  the  community's  duties.  If
               someone is at fault or is late for a good reason, he will go to
               the assistant to apologize (R.A.).]]></page><page Index="548"><![CDATA[Be not moved by tenderness or by inopportune piety for
               X, because I doubt that this person will succeed. Let us pray
               and  be  vigilant,  letting  me  know  her  behavior.  Please
               encourage and treat her with true charity, but demand her to
               behave! In the community we must seek the common more
               than the individual good. It is better to be few in number and
               good,  than  having  false  vocations,  which  ruin  the
               communities (Letter, Aug. 14, 1913).

                    Discipline  means  perfect  obedience.  Obedience!  To
               become dear to God and to the people, and to become worth
               advancing  in religious  Life, the  aspirant  has  to  practice  this
               virtue.

                    An  aspirant  must  not  seek  to escape  the  obedience  of
               the immediate superior under the pretext of the absent major
               superiors' obedience. He must subject himself to the present
               one, and follow his decision, because it is he who takes over
               the responsibility (R.A.).

                    The Daughters of Divine Zeal will obey every article of   548
               their rule as if they were the legitimate superiors' voice, and
               will  participate  in  the  acts  in  common,  which  are  usually
               announced by the bell's chime. The Daughters of Divine Zeal
               will do nothing without obedience, not even drinking a cup of
               water between meals (C.D.D.Z.).

                    The practice of obedience is also a practice of religious
               discipline, which must be performed in everything. No one by
               arbitrary initiative can give an obedience, or a command, or a
               commission  to  others  without  agreeing  beforehand  with  the
               superior;  those  who  are  aware  of  such  undue  orders,  or
               commissions, will not obey. In little things, however, one can
               help  by  charity.  Also  the  fulfillment  of  the  office  belongs  to
               discipline (C.R.).

                    St. Joseph Little Retreat novices will not be fond of going
               to the parlor, but will go only when necessary. When obliged
               by necessity, they will do so expeditiously. If the]]></page><page Index="549"><![CDATA[novices  go  to  the  parlor  without  permission,  or  without  a
               chaperon, they commit a serious fault.

               When  a  novice  is  sent  to  the  parlor,  she  will  invoke  Jesus
               Christ our Lord, asking him for help before going there. She
               will also see to it that her speech be edifying, exhorting the
               persons she meets to do good, and avoiding to speak about
               the private affairs of the community to the outsiders (R.L.P.).
               (1)

                       During  the  play  activities,  the  aspirants  will  avoid
               causing  any  disorder,  laying  hands  on  others,  saying
               offensive  words,  talking  secretly  (what  is  forbidden  in  any
               time), and leaving without permission (R.A.).

                          A modest, joyous, daily recreation is necessary for the
               sisters. They are exhorted to be always cheerful, driving away
               sadness  and  melancholy.  No  one  will  cry  for  trifles,  but  will
               keep their tears for serious motives, such as: for our Lord, for
               the holy Church, for its needs, and for the whole humankind!   549
               During  play  activities,  joy  and  holy  happiness  have  to
               transpire in order that all may praise and bless the Lord; and
               yet, they will beware of immoderate splay (D.S.C.). (2)


                            2. DISCIPLINE AND OBEDIENCE

                       The first virtue the aspirants must practice is perfect
               subordination  not  only  to  the  chief  superior's  authority  but
               also to the minor superiors, and especially to the immediate
               one, whoever the may be.

                       This  subordination  must  be  humble  and  perfect  in
               any  case  and  circumstance;  therefore,  if  the  aspirants  are
               warned or admonished, they will listen humbly, bowing their
               head  eyes  downcast  and  keeping  silence.  During  the
               reprehension  they  cannot  apologize,  unless  the  superior
               requires it or they themselves ask, and are granted it. In]]></page><page Index="550"><![CDATA[either  case,  the  aspirants  will  do  it  in  a  low  voice,  fine
               manners, and once. If their apology is refused, they will not
               reply, but will receive the reprehension in silence, saying at
               the end of the reprehension: « I am at fault and wrong; I will
               never do it again, » which deserves great merit. If they do not
               say  it  at  the  end  of  the  reprehension,  they  will  do  so  later,
               after  retiring  into  themselves.  During  the  reprehension,  any
               emotional sign such as anger, annoyance, or amusement is
               considered a serious insubordination.

                    What we have said of the reprehension is also true of the
               orders. To oppose them with replying, or with being agitated,
               or  with  murmuring,  is  a  serious  fault  of  insubordination.  An
               aspirant  behaving  so,  shows  that  he  is  full  of  pride.  If
               penances or punishments are given, they must be accepted
               humbly and submissively.

                    When the aspirant receives penances or is corrected, he
               has  to  combine  external  with  internal  humility  and
               submission, acknowledging before God that he deserves the
               reprehension or the punishment, because reprehension and   550
               punishment are given to him for his good.
                    Unless  he has  these  interior  dispositions,  he  will  never
               improve, because the Holy Spirit says: « Taking pleasure in
               evil earns condemnation » (Eccl. 19, 5).

                    Discipline  builds  up  order,  peace,  and  wealth;  lack  of
               discipline  turns everything  upside dawn... The  aspirants  will
               refrain from commanding and obeying each other, because it
               is  against  discipline,  save  particular  momentary  cases  in
               which  the  petitioner  will  say:  Please...  No  one  will  interfere
               with the ether's office. The aspirants are forbidden to speak to
               each other of things that happened before their entrance in
               the institute as well as to refer to words or events regarding
               their  parents,  who  came  to  the  parlor,  or  who  wrote  letters
               (R.A.).]]></page><page Index="551"><![CDATA[The practice of obedience implies perfect discipline; it is
               useful,  therefore,  to  touch  upon  some  disciplinary  points,
               because  the  community  founds  its  orderly  life  on  the
               observance of them.

                   Regular  discipline  demands  perfect  observance  of  the
               rule. To be exact in discipline, the probationers must keep in
               mind the rule by reading part of it every day of the week; they
               will pay serious attention to it, and will make an examination
               of  conscience  on  their  faults,  repenting  and  making
               resolutions.

                   The  actions  in  common  belong  to  discipline,  and  are
               announced  by  the  bell's  chime,  which  is  the  voice  of
               obedience  for  the  probationers.  Remembering  the  words  of
               the  apostle:  «  Everything  must  be  done  in  a  proper  and
               orderly way » (Cor. 14, 40), as well as St. Ambrose's saying:
               «  The  Spirit  does  not  knave  ill-timed  things  »,  the
               probationers will not waste time between the various actions,
               because  time  is  most  precious.  Passing  from  one  place  to
               another,  the  probationers  will  proceed  modestly  by  two   551
               (P.R.P.).

                   For external discipline we mean the practical rules which
               regulate the actions of the community and of its members.

                   a)  Schedule:  The  community  needs  to  perform  the
               actions in common on fixed time, and when the schedule has
               been  established,  it  must  be  observed.  Modifications
               according  to  seasons  and  circumstances  may  be  made  by
               the  mother  superior;  for  remarkable  things,  however,  the
               major superior's advice is required.

                   b) Actions in common are the ones the members perform
               together,  such  as:  reveille,  meditation,  mass,  refectory,
               recreation activities, and the like. No one can pass over the
               actions in common without the mother superior's permission,
               who will grant it for legitimate reasons. The bell's chime will
               be like the voice of obedience (D.S.S.).]]></page><page Index="552"><![CDATA[3. THE SUPERIOR MUST BE VIGILANT

                    The  superior  will  be  the  first  in  the  observance  of  the
               actions  in  common,  such  as:  reveille,  meditation,  schedule,
               silence,  work,  and  everything;  but  due  to  visits,  audiences,
               and business, he may depart from the schedule. But, he will
               pay careful attention to establish good example, and will pray
               to succeed in it, business notwithstanding. Our Lord will help
               him to participate in the actions in common, and when he is
               unable,  his  involuntary  absence  will  not  damage,  nor  will  it
               establish bad example. When his absence is due to sickness,
               the  superior  will  not  let  himself  be  won  by  temptation.  A
               person full of faith and zeal can participate in the actions in
               common, at least partially, even when he is feverish; the good
               Jesus  will  give  a  helping  hand!  In  such  cases,  the  subjects
               themselves will ask the superior for exemption. We, however,
               do not want the superior to observe all the actions in common
               even  when  he  is  sick,  but  we  are  exhorting  him  to  behave
               according  to  faith,  zeal,  trust  in  Jesus,  sacrifice,  and
               prudence. When he is forced to be bedridden, never mind! He
               will  participate  in  the  actions  in  common  after  healing.   552
               Meanwhile,  he  will  pray  to  Jesus  for  help  in  order  to
               participate  in  the  actions  in  common,  and  Jesus  will  see  to
               this important matter of his glory (R.S.).

                    Each  superior  will  foster  the  spiritual  progress  of  the
               community  entrusted  to  him  by  taking  care  of  the  various
               groups and of the whole community. This will be the tap list
               interest. He will carefully strive to prevent lukewarmness from
               influencing the community, especially in the religious actions,
               in the meditation, and in the reception of the sacraments. He
               will  be  most  vigilant  to  prevent  the  community  from
               committing even a tight deliberate sin, and will take care of
               the persons entrusted to him as the]]></page><page Index="553"><![CDATA[most cherished, knowing that he is responsible for them, and
               will give an account to the Lord (R.S.).

                       So  that  no  rule  falls  into  disuse,  the  superior  will
               demand  observance  of  all  of  them,  seeing  also  that  the
               institute's  uses  and  customs,  especially  the  feasts  and  the
               religious  practices  be  observed.  He  will  have  at  heart  the
               sacred decorous worship of God, the veneration of the most
               holy Virgin, and of the saints, as well as the practices of piety
               and  the  religious  virtues,  such  as:  humility,  obedience,  and
               mortification. He will teach the people the love for Jesus and
               Mary,  detachment,  mutual  charity,  and  piety  along  with  the
               spiritual and temporal love for neighbor.

                       Each  superior  will  bear  in  mind  that  without  God's
               blessing  nothing  succeeds,  nothing  improves,  and  that  God
               blesses  only  when  he  is  worshipped  and  loved,  when  the
               community is guided and cultivated well. In such a case the
               Lord's blessings pour out on that community, which will bloom
               spiritually  and  temporally,  because  the  most  holy  Heart  of   553
               Jesus  is  also  infinitely  effusive  and  generous  with  temporal
               wealth, when the goods are directed to his glory (R.S.). (3)

                   (1)  «The  sisters  will  not  be  fond  of  going  to  the  parlor.  When
               convenience or necessity obliges them to go, they will beware of wasting
               time by prolonging the visit. Time is so precious that not even a moment
               must be wasted. The sisters will regulate both the time and the speech
               according to the persons and to the circumstances. As to the strictest
               relations's  visit,  the  sister  listener  will  not  allow  worldly  talks.  While
               talking  with  her  parents,  either  the  sister  or  the  probationer  will  be
               edifying,  exhorting  them  to  attend  the  sacraments  and  to  do  good.
               Young  men  are  not  allowed  to  visit  the  house.  If  young  ladies  dress

               when they have to, they will leave in little groups in order to avoid the
               people's   attention.   Walking   modestly,   they   will   avoid   talking with
               other  people,  and  will  greet  others  seldom;  for  instance,  if  the  sisters
               meet priests, they will  make a   little  bow only. Should  they go to some
               house with  the  mother superior's  permission,  they will behave with

                                  PARTISAN SPIRIT

                    I will avoid the partisan spirit as a pestilence, as the
               beginning  of  the  institute's  full  ruin.  If  I  perceive  it
               appearing,  I  will  fight  it  through  good  exhortation,
               example, sacrifice, and by resorting to the superiors.

                    When  I  have  to  vote  on  some  report  or  on  the
               institute's business, I will pray fervently and will ponder
               the  matter;  then  I  will  vote  honestly  in  the  presence  of
               God,  avoiding  the  partisan  spirit,  human  respect,  and
               personal motives. I entreat the most holy Hearts of Jesus
               and  Mary  to  free  me  and  my  brethren  in  Jesus  Christ
               from the partisan spirit.

                    Because this institute may open several houses with the
               Lord's  blessing,  the  sisters  will  branch  off  to  form  various
               centers of ruling communities. With all my heart and for our
               Lord  Jesus  Christ's  innermost  feelings  I  exhort  St.  Joseph   555
               Retreat sisters to never separate themselves spiritually from
               each  other,  since  the  spiritual  separation  ruins  the  institute.
               They  must  remain  united  in  the  spirit  through  the  mutual
               bonds of charity, help, and support, as members of the same
               body. May they stand aloof from the partisan spirit in order to
               form  one  mind  and  one  heart  by  praying  for  each  other.  I
               warmly  recommend  this  rule  to  the  sisters,  because  their
               existence and progress depend on its observance (C.D.D.Z.).

                    A most malignant evil to be avoided is the partisan spirit
               as  the  one  which  ruins  any  religious  community,  old  and
               observant as it may be. Woe, if two or three agree secretly or
               clearly  to  oppose  authority,  speaking  ill  of  the  brethren,
               grumbling, disapproving, plotting, and winning]]></page><page Index="556"><![CDATA[followers. By so doing, various parties rise, and they confirm
               the  gospel's  saying:    «  A  family  divided  against  itself  falls
               apart » (Lk. 11, 17). The observance of the rule, the practice
               of  the  virtues,  and  the  avoidance  of  contradiction  help  to
               maintain the union of hearts. We must follow the counsel of
               the Holy Spirit: « Avoid stupid arguments... and fights » (Tit.
               3, 9). (C.R.).

                    The formation of parties opens a fateful door to the devil,
               who  does  not  aim  at  the  decline,  but  at  the  full  ruin  of  a
               community! The superior will carefully prevent it at any cost.
               Grumbles, grudges, and partiality cause the formation of the
               parties. Partialities or bad direction by the superior may also
               cause their ruse. Therefore, he will be most vigilant to avoid
               it,  and  will  pray  and  act  to  blow  out  this  fire  from  its  very
               beginning.

                    Caution. The superior must avoid giving a name to what
               does not exist, or is feared to exist, or is rising. For instance,
               when the party does not exist, but the superior is fearful of its   556
               rising, he must beware of pronouncing the word party even
               while  he  is  remedying  some  inconvenience.  The  only
               utterance  of  the  noun  party  could  cause  its rising,  because
               the  names  have  a  great  power  of  creating  ideas.  Prudence
               demands of the superior to blow out the spark without making
               a  noise,  as  well  as  without  scolding,  admonishing,  and
               pointing to what he fears.

                    This  is  also  true  for  jealousy.  To  avoid  its  rising,  or  to
               make it die at its rising, it is better not to mention it (R.S.).]]></page><page Index="557"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXXV


                         HOLY INDIFFERENCE TO TRANSFER

                    I will not be attached to any house or person of the
               Institute; but, in spiritual freedom I will be always ready
               to  transfer  to  any  house  and  to  accept  any  office  to
               which  I  will  be  appointed,  seeking  God  alone  and  the
               good of the order.

                    Since the institute has already several houses and it is
               likely to found others with the Lord's help, I declare that I am
               ready  to  transfer  to  any  of  them,  even  when  I  do  not  know
               why,  if  obedience  demands  that of  me.  I  will  live  happily  in
               any community, as in the mother-house, by observing these
               promises and protestations.  When  I  have  a good  reason  to
               humbly ask the superiors for transferring me or for going into
               retirement,  I  will  keep  calm  even  if  the  superiors  deny  my
               request. If through deliberate misbehavior I happen to force
               the superiors to retire me, I agree that I would be at fault with   557
               faithfulness  toward  God  and  obedience,  becoming  an
               unworthy Religious who sets bad example by placing herself
               under  the  devil's  obedience;  therefore,  I  would  deserve  the
               expulsion, unless I repent (D.P.).

                    Daughter  in  Jesus  Christ,  please  see  whether  the  in-
               disposition you plead depends on the regret that you live in
               Altamura, far from the house of Trani. The air is excellent in
               Altamura. You have no disease. Your physical weakness is
               increased by prostration because you live in this house with
               regret. It is homesickness, due too lack of submission and of
               virtue. You are not making a steady]]></page><page Index="558"><![CDATA[resolution to live where obedience wants you to. You are not
               praying to the Lord and the most holy Virgin to help you to
               live where the divine will has placed you. You are like a child
               crying and seeking mom. Daughter, you must know that when
               a  youth  dislikes  being  in  a  house,  she  is  affected  by
               homesickness. It is a moral disease causing other diseases
               apparently. It can cause even fever! When a young Religious
               understands that holy obedience and the Lord's will want her
               to stay in a place, she stands fast against the temptations of
               the  devil  and  of nature.  She  does  not  fall  sick  but  is  full  of
               peace,  strength,  and  health!  How  can  you  feel  sorry  for
               yourself  because  you  dwell  in  this  house,  whose  church  is
               dedicated  to  the  most  holy  Immaculate  Mary?  In  a  house
               situated better than that of Trani, which is the most unhappy
               among ours for its position? The walk in the beautiful gardens
               refreshes the spirit. Meanwhile, I am sorry that your voluntary
               prostration,  which  is  due  to  lack  of  consideration,  sets  bad
               examples  to  the  community,  to  the  probationers  and  to  the
               children.  Blessed  daughter,  be  calm,  take  courage,  be  in  a
               happy mood, do not behave like a child. As a Religious, show
               faithfulness to your celestial spouse. Resume your work little   558
               by  little,  and  be,  perfectly  obedient  to  your  good  mother
               superior.  God  helps  all  the  obedient  souls  (Letter,  May  12,
               1923).

                    I regret to inform you that some persons of the religious
               community  have  been  sorry  and  reluctant  at  the  order  of
               transfer  from  a  house  to  another.  For  that  reason  we  have
               thought  of  mailing  a  specific  formula  of  obedience  to  the
               houses so that the persons who take the habit or the vows,
               recite it with all their heart at the foot of the great Mother of
               God.  First,  they  will  recite  it  to  ask  the  Divine  Superior  for
               admittance;  second,  they  will  recite  it  during  the  religious
               service in the church, at the foot]]></page><page Index="559"><![CDATA[of the Holy Sacrament, before the taking of the habit or the
               vows; third, they will sign it. (1) The copies will be preserved
               in the archives along with the documents. Everyone must be
               convinced that this chief point, whose violation may become a
               serious  fault  through  the  only  internal  approbation,  may
               prevent  the  culprit  from  receiving  Holy  Communion.  Please
               note, however, that we are not talking about a fleeing thought
               that  crosses  the  mind  without  consideration  (2)  (Circular,
               March 10, 1926).

               superiors will order me to transfer from a house to another. \ will observe
               it in the following way:

                                    FALLING SICK

                   If  I  do  not  feel  well  or  I  need  medical  care,  I  will
               beware of failing because of sickness. I will rely patiently
               on  the  superiors  and on  the  brethren's  charity,  holding
               that  even  a  sick  Religious  has  to  observe  holy  poverty
               and to suffer  some want  or negligence  as  permitted  by
               God in order to set better examples. As a matter of fact,
               the good soldier is tested in the battle.


                    1. DO NOT BECOME LUKEWARM IN SICKNESS

                    While entering this institute, I promise once and for ever
               to hand over to the mother superior everything I have without
               keeping  anything  secretly,  not  even  the  medals  or  the
               scapulars,  still  less  ear-rings,  jewels,  money,  souvenir  of
               friends  or  of  relatives,  photos,  letters,  and  the  like.  By  so   561
               doing  I  mean  to  embrace  holy  poverty;  hence,  I  will  not
               complain of eventual want, not even when I am sick, but I will
               be satisfied with the mother superiors' charity. (D.P.).

                    The  novice  cook  will  be  most  diligent  in  preparing  the
               food for the sick at the right time.

                    The  sister  nurse  will  attend  to  the  sick  with  charitable
               feelings, bringing the food in time and providing medical care.
               To  respond  to  the  demands  of  the  sick  patiently,  the  sister
               nurse  will  foster  charity,  patience,  meekness,  and  holy
               humility. She will treat their physical disease,]]></page><page Index="562"><![CDATA[and will also raise their spirit by visiting and comforting them
               as much as it is allowed (R.L.P.).

                    Both  nurse  and  assistant  will  observe  the  community's
               devotion, recollection, and piety in the infirmary, even when
               there  is  only  one  patient;  they  will  foster  good  feelings,  will
               schedule  the  morning,  noon,  and  evening  prayers  together
               with the mother superior, and will read the meditation on the
               intimate  sorrows  of  Jesus  in  the  morning  and  the  evening;
               likewise they will help the sick say the prayer before and after
               the meal. An hour of silence must be established during the
               day, but everything must be done in order to meet the needs
               of the sick. In case of epidemic, the utmost must be done with
               the Lord's help (S.D.D.Z.).

                    When the sisters fall sick, they should not fail in the spirit
               of poverty; on the contrary, they will seize that opportunity to
               practice  poverty  by  practicing  patience.  They  may  humbly
               submit  their  needs  to  the  mother  superior,  relying  on  her
               generosity, without claiming the treatment which is due to the   562
               rich (C.D.D.Z.).


                            2. TAKING CARE OF THE SICK

                    Nurse. A patient and charitable Religious, expert in how
               to take care of the sick and how to receive, keep, and treat
               them through hygiene and medicine will be the male nurse.
               He will perceive the people who do not feel well, even when
               they conceal it, and in agreement with the superiors he will
               take  care  of  them  in  the  infirmary.  Attending  to  the  sick
               means  care  of  the  bed,  of  the  room,  of  hygiene  and  of
               cleanness.  Treating  the  sick  requires  that  he  send  for  the
               doctor, carry out the prescriptions, and be responsible during
               the  course  of  their  illness,  for  the  food,  and  for  everything
               required.]]></page><page Index="563"><![CDATA[The  male  nurse  will  also  see  to  it  that  devotion  and
               piety  be  observed  in  the  infirmary.  Paying  careful  attention
               that the Holy Communion be available to the sick every day,
               he  will  read  spiritual  passages  for  those  who  are  able  to
               listen, will exhort the sick to cheerfulness and patience, will
               prevent defects and idle talk, making them bear in mind that
               the  devil  makes  the  sick  relax  when  bodily  health  only  is
               cared for.

                    Since the male nurse must take care of the sick by day
               and by night, he will the given some helpers. He will set apart
               the contagious sick with due precaution, and will take care of
               all the patients during their convalescence until they recover.

                    If  a  sick  grow  worse,  the  male  nurse  is  obliged  under
               strict  obligation of  conscience  to  inform  the superiors about
               the  administration  of  the  holy  sacraments  and  about  the
               appropriate assistance. He will see that the place for the most
               holy  Viaticum  be  prepared  with  the  greatest  decorum,  that
               holy confession, extreme unction, and the most holy Viaticum   563
               be available in time so that the sick person may be spiritually
               prepared and may also heal naturally (C.R.).

                    The  nurse  will  be  a  charitable  sister  who  is  compas-
               sionate,  loving,  sympathetic,  and  who  sees  Jesus  Christ
               suffering  in  the  sick  persons.  Fully  aware  of  her  delicate
               office, which deserves a great reward, she will cope with the
               sick  as  she  herself  would  like  to  be  treated.  The  nurse
               helpers  will  do  the  same.  The  nurse  will  often  inform  the
               mother superior about the sick, especially the serious ones,
               and  will  be  most  vigilant  that  the  holy  sacraments  of  the
               confession,  Viaticum,  and  extreme  unction  be  available  to
               them, according to the Church's teaching. Besides forgiving
               sins  and  their  vestiges,  extreme  unction  heals  the  body
               without fail at these two conditions:]]></page><page Index="564"><![CDATA[1.  That  the  sick  receive  the  extreme  unction  when  a
               decisive change may occur in the course of disease without a
               miracle; if the sacrament is given when such a change cannot
               occur without a miracle, the extreme unction has no effect on
               the body, because it does not work through miracles.

                    2. That the sick improve in spiritual life after recovering;
               in  fact,  if  recovery  were  to  the  prejudice  of  the  soul,  God
               would  deprive  the  extreme  unction  of  its  healing  power.
               Therefore, so that the extreme unction may heal the sick, it
               must  be  received  in  time,  when  the  disease  is  serious,  but
               death is not unavoidable; and the sick must make resolves of
               behaving  in  a  new,  perfect,  holy  manner  through  the
               amending of defects and bad inclinations as well as through
               the  practice  of  holy  virtues  and  the  perfect  observance  of
               divine law.

                    If extreme unction is given in time and the sick will keep
               his resolves, the sacrament will heal without fail.

                    The  mother  superior  and  the nurse  are  warmly  recom-  564
               mended  to  prepare  the  sick  for  extreme unction  in  time;  on
               the other hand, each sister must be mindful of asking for this
               sacrament when she is struck by serious disease. Because
               extreme unction has frequently healed when it was received
               in time, the sacrament has been called Anointing of the Sick;
               also the prayers of this sacrament implore the healing of the
               sick who are receiving it. (S.D.D.Z.).


                                 3. SPIRITUAL MEANS

                    The chief spiritual means to recover from sickness is the
               use  of  Holy  Oil.  Additional  means  are  the  community's
               prayers, novenas or triduos, especially when the sick suffers
               a great deal.]]></page><page Index="565"><![CDATA[Another  spiritual  means  is  the  invocation  of  the  most
               holy name of Jesus by saying one Our Father, Hail Mary, and
               Glory  before  and  after  the  sick  swallow  a  slip  of  paper  on
               which  the  name  of  Jesus  is  written.  When  this  most  holy,
               powerful  name  was  given  and  was  received  with  faith,  it
               healed many times.

                    Oil  from  the  tabernacle's  lamp  may  be  used  together
               with the prayers from the Riva Filotea, or with other prayers
               and  pious  practices;  but  the  community  and  the  sick  will
               perform everything, conforming perfectly to the divine will.

                    These  means  must  be  used  for  the  sick  in  the  same
               way,  without  preference;  by  so  doing,  we  please  our  Lord,
               who  will  heal  the  persons,  especially  those  who  are  more
               concerned with the community's interests. While using these
               means,  the  sick  are  also  prepared  to  trust  in  the  divine  will
               and to conform to it.

                    When  even  the  least  among  the  Religious  is  seriously
               sick, all earthly and celestial means will be used to make her   565
               recover (S.D.D.Z.).]]></page><page Index="566"><![CDATA[566]]></page><page Index="567"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXXVII

                             ACCEPTING THE CHANGES
                               IN THE DECLARATIONS

                   I am signing these declarations and promises with a
               free will after examining and considering them carefully. I
               acknowledge that the spirit of the institute, of the rules,
               and of the constitutions Is contained in them.

                   From now on I accept any addition or change that the
               legitimate authority will consider just to ameliorate them,
               or to make them more fitting to the observance, or more
               effective for the Institute and the congregants. In view of
               what may arise in the future, I will follow the superiors'
               advice and directives as well as the usages and customs
               of the institute.

                   I  also  declare  to  accept  the  rules  and  the
               constitutions  that  the  legitimate  authority  will  make  for
               the     congregants     of    this   pious     Institute.  567]]></page><page Index="568"><![CDATA[568]]></page><page Index="569"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXXVIII

                          READING THESE DECLARATIONS

                   I will take care to read daily, with full attention from
               the book of declarations and promises that the superiors
               will give me, at least one article a day and try to conform
               my behavior to it. I will also pay careful attention to the
               reading of the declarations in the community in order to
               profit by them.

                   I promise to be attentive to the reading of these protests,
               promises, and declarations in order to keep them in my mind,
               and to avoid any excuse when my behavior does not conform
               to them. Furthermore, I consent and accept that the mother
               superior  admonish  me  on  the  ground  of  these  promises,
               especially if I am so negligent as to be at fault with same of
               the  protests  and  declarations  that  I  have  made  and  signed
               (D.P.).

                                                                         569]]></page><page Index="570"><![CDATA[570]]></page><page Index="571"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XXXIX

                       DUTY TO OBSERVE THE DECLARATIONS

                   As to the duty to observe the declarations, I conform
               to  the  religious  orders'  constitutions  written  by  saints:
               they declare that the rules themselves do not oblige the
               congregants  to  the  observance  under  pain  of  sin.  For
               instance:  the  rules  command  to  keep  silence  during
               certain  hours;  It  is  understood  that  the  command  does
               not oblige under pain of sin; likewise, mortifications, life
               in common, and so on, are commanded without pain of
               sin.

                   However,  I  know  that the holy  writers,  among  them
               St.  Francis  of  Sales  and  St.  Alphonsus  de'  Liguori,
               doctors of the holy Church and founders of orders, teach
               that  the  congregants  may  sin  even  gravely  against  the
               rules in the following cases:

                   1.  When  they  transgress  the  rules  which  coincide   571
               with divine or natural or ecclesiastical law, such as: the
               duty to set good example, the devout celebration of the
               mysteries, and the fasting commanded by the Church.

                   2. When they transgress the rules by contempt.

                   3.  When  the  repeated  transgression  of  the  rules
               scandalizes or upsets the community.

                   4. When the transgressor runs the risk of losing his
               vocation  or  of  relaxing  to  such  a  degree  as  to  fall  into
               serious  faults,  because  of  his  repeated  transgressions
               against the rules.

                    Given  all  this,  since  now  I  entreat  my  superiors  to
               warn,  to  admonish,  or  to  reproach  me  with  these
               promises and declarations that I sign, when I am at fault
               with  some  of  them  either  for  human  frailty  or  for  the
               hellish enemy's suggestion; I deposit them in their hands
               as in the adorable Lord Jesus]]></page><page Index="572"><![CDATA[Christ's  hands,  to  be  in  their  power.  Furthermore,  If  I
               happen  to  contradict  the  superiors'  warnings,  or
               admonitions,  or  reproofs,  or  if  I  happen  to  excuse
               myself, or to break these sacred pacts, I declare that all
               this  may  only  happen  because  of  my  fault,  by  mind's
               blindness,  the  hellish  suggestion,  and  my  own  pride,
               despite  the  false  reasons,  or  the  sophisms,  or  the
               expedients that I may use to justify myself.

                   I repeat what I have said in passing at the article 28:
               If  I  happen  to  be  at  fault  with  these  declarations  and
               promises, I will go to confess my fault in the sacrament
               of reconciliation.








                                                                         572]]></page><page Index="573"><![CDATA[CHAPTER XL


                            PRAYER FOR PERSEVERANCE

                    Because I feel myself too needy of the divine help I
               order  to  observe  these  holy  promises  and  to  faithfully
               persevere  until  my  last  breath,  I  humbly  entreat  my
               superior and brethren to implore divine help for me from
               the Lon Jesus and from the most holy Virgin, as I myself
               promise  to  do.  Since  now,  I  put  this  Intention  in  the
               prayer  of  the  divine  office,  in  the  holy  mass,  in  the
               rosary, as well as in any work of charity and religion that
               I will perform with the divine help, and in any sorrow that
               the Lord will let me suffer. (1)

                    I acknowledge that this divine help will never fail as
               Iong as I keep these intentions and persevere in my good
               will; but,  If  my  will  fails, everything  will  fail  for  my  own
               fault. God forbid It!
                                                                         573
                    I wrote these declarations and promises in San Pier
               Niceto, during the novena of the Assumption; I finished
               them on August 15, 1910, Monday, at 4:00 p.m.

                                            The unworthy priest,
                                            Mary Hannibal Di Francia.

                    At  last,  to  observe  these  promises,  protests,  any
               declarations,  from  now  on  I  will  implore  humbly  and
               perseveringly the most holy Heart of Jesus, the immaculate
               Heart of Mary, the great Patriarch St. Joseph, St. Michael the
               archangel,  the  angels,  the  holy  apostles,  and  my  patron
               saints, especially St. Anthony of Padua. I am convinced that
               as long as I have good will, the divine help will not fail; but, if I
               break  these  promises,  protests,  and  declarations  in  such  a
               way  as  to  lose  perseverance  or  to  compel  the  superiors  to
               expel me from the institute (God]]></page><page Index="574"><![CDATA[forbid it), since now I acknowledge that this ruin will happen
               for my own bad will. Amen (D.P.).

                    1.  SPIRITUAL  UNION  AMONG  THE  MOST  INDUS-
               TRIOUS  PERSONS  OF  THE  PIOUS  INSTITUTE  OF  THE
               POOR BY THE HEART OF JESUS. (2)

                    Messina,  Sept.  25  (Sunday,  feast  of  Our  Lady  of
               Lourdes), 1898.

                    Owing  to  the  moral  and  to  the  material  circumstances
               which threaten the institute with death, the ruling staff of the
               institute along with the elders and the more faithful members
               have made the following resolutions in the name of Jesus and
               Immaculate Mary.

                    I.  -  By  the  Lord’s  help,  the  individuals  of  this  spiritual
               union  promise  to  redouble  their  trust  in  God's  infinite
               goodness, in the most holy Heart of Jesus' infinite mercy, and
               in  the  most  holy  Mary's,  in  the  angels',  and  in  the  patron   574
               saints'  powerful  intercession.  The  greater  the  growth  of
               tribulations,  the  want,  the  human  suspicions,  the  perils  of
               dissolution  of  this  Institute,  the  more  the  members  of  this
               spiritual union will trust in God. They choose as their motto
               the Apostle Paul's saying: «We hope against hope. »

                    Il.  -  So  that  their  hope  and  trust  be  truly  Christian,  the
               members of the spiritual union decide:

                    1. To receive everything from God. They will consider all
               happenings,  as  coming  from  him  through  his  reigning  or
               permitting will, not from human beings or by chance; they will
               find a reason, therefore, to humble themselves, to praise, and
               to bless the divine will in any event.

                    2. They will rectify their intention in order to seek in this
               institute the glory of God, the sanctification, and]]></page><page Index="575"><![CDATA[the salvation of souls, for the greater consolation of Jesus'
               Heart.

                    3.  They  will  give  all  their  cooperation  through  prayer,
               work, and sacrifice for the salvation of the institute.

                    4.  They  first  will  suffer  with  holy  conformity  the  penury
               permitted by God; will embrace the community's most difficult
               work,  and  will  sacrifice  themselves  as  victims  of  charity  for
               God's glory and for the souls' good.

                    5. They will pray in private and in common every day for
               the institute; if the circumstances allow it, they will also pray in
               the  night.  Their  prayer  and  work  will  be  combined  with
               mortification and fasting;

                    6.  They  will  redouble  their  attention  to  the  practice  of
               holy  virtues,  setting  good  example  with  the  Lord's  help  in
               order to avoid sin. Avoidance of sin will appease God, who
               will be merciful to us.                                   575

                    7. They will receive Holy Communion every day with the
               Lord's help, if it is possible. (3)

                    8.  The  members  of  the  spiritual  union  renew  explicitly
               their  resolution  to  persevere  in  the  service  to  God  in  this
               institute  in  spite  of  persecutions,  failure,  discouragement,
               tribulations,  want,  and  oppositions,  unless  the  Lord  shows
               manifestly  through  the  ecclesiastical  authority  that  he  does
               not want this institute any longer.

                                          NOTES

                   (1) Our padre wrote this prayer:
                   «O  Mother of the  holy perseverance,  we  appeal  to your motherly
               love. Please grant us this great grace that crowns the others: help us to
               persevere,  to  grow  in  religious  virtues,  and  to  die  a  good  death  for
               eternal salvation.
                   O glorious St. Joseph, we also put our perseverance in your hands;
               pray for us. Amen.]]></page><page Index="576"><![CDATA[Ejaculatory prayer: Lord Jesus,  save us from mortal and venial sin,
               giving  us  holy perseverance. Amen.»
                   (2)  Our padre gave this, title. Keep in  mind  the date  Sept. 25,
               1898: the institute was surviving  the painful trial that threatened  it with
               death.  Melania  was  going  to  leave  Messina  and  our  padre  was
               compelled  to  resort  to  the  older  persons'  generosity,  who  were  more
               faithful  and  affectionate  to  the  institute:  to  guarantee  the  institute's
               future, he excited their zeal for their sanctification. In that time, the feast
               of Our Lady of Lourdes was not universal and  was  perhaps celebrated
               on that day in Messina,
                   (3)  Be not amazed at this article. In those times, the decrees by St.
               Pious  X  on  the  daily  communion  had  not  come  out  yet;  our  padre,
               however, was a forerunner.

               A) About forgiveness of sins

                    My Lord Jesus Christ, kneeling in your divine presence
               like the prodigal son at the foot of his father and helped by
               your divine grace, I protest through my vows to never distrust
               your  infinite  goodness,  clemency, and  mercy  in  spite  of  my
               past,  present,  and  future  iniquities,  either  grave  or  light,  in
               which I might fall. As for my past sins, I protest through my
               vows  that  I  will  be  always  confident  that  you  have  forgiven
               them, even though I do not give up the holy fear and the sad
               remembrance of them. As for the future faults in which I may
               fall, I protest through my vows that I will never distrust your
               mercy, even though I might fall in the most serious iniquities
               of the world; I will always trust to be forgiven in full by falling
               down  at  your  feet  and  by  asking  pardon  for  your  sweetest   579
               Heart's sake.

                    Were  I  to  fall  seventy  seven  times  seven  in  the  same
               iniquities  which  I  committed  in  the  past  or  in  worse  ones,  I
               protest through my vows that I will always trust in your infinite
               goodness, imploring your pardon in the same way, sure that
               your sweetest Heart's superabundant piety shall forgive me in
               full as though I had never offended you before. Therefore, I
               take my vows that in any case, and in any relapse, I will come
               to you as though that fault were the first one, sure that you
               will  receive  me  with  open  arms,  on  condition  that  my
               repentance be true, sincere, and loving.]]></page><page Index="580"><![CDATA[B) As to the prayer's efficacy

                    San  Pier  Niceto,  May  5,  1905  (Ascension  of  our  Lord
               Jesus Christ)
                    My  beloved  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  kneeling  in  your  divine
               presence,  in  the  abyss  of my  nothingness  I  protest  through
               my vows that I always want to trust in your infinite goodness
               as well as in your divine promises that you hear our prayers.
               You said: «The Father will give you whatever you ask of him
               in my name » (Jn. 15, 16); «Ask, and you will receive; seek,
               and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you»
               (Mt. 7, 7); « Until now you have not asked for anything in my
               name; ask and you will receive, so that your happiness may
               be complete» (Jn. 16, 24). Likewise, I intend to confide in the
               expressive parable of the friend knocking at another friend's
               door in the night and asking for three loaves to welcome other
               persons  -  the  friend  is  you,  my  supreme  goodness.  -Even
               though the friend was unwilling to get up to give the loaves,
               still  he  surrendered  because  of  the  importunity  of  the
               situation,  and gave  the  three  loaves.  Also  in  the  parable  of
               the woman seeking justice from an unjust judge  -not from a   580
               judge friend, what a wonder! - and the unjust judge - you are
               not, my supreme goodness - satisfied that woman because of
               her importunity!

                    In  the  presence  of  these  ineffable  and  surprising
               promises,  I  take  my  vow  to  always  trust  in  you,  in  your
               adorable  Heart,  in  your  infinite  goodness  and  liberality,  as
               well as in your most holy mother, in your angels and saints,
               whom  I  implore  in  your  name.  I  trust  that  you  will  infallibly
               grant me the graces I have asked, the ones I am used to ask,
               and will ask for your glory, for the salvation of the souls, for
               me  the  miserable  and  for  my  relatives,  as  well  as  for  the
               Rogation's  and  for  Divine  Zeal's  institutes  along  with  their
               charitable and religious works.]]></page><page Index="581"><![CDATA[If  I  ask  you  or  your  most  holy  mother  or  the  angels  or  the
               saints  for  these  graces,  mercies,  and  celestial  favors  with
               pure  intention,  humility,  holy  fervor,  pious  insistence,  and
               perseverance,  conforming  to  your  adorable  merciful  will,  I
               trust that you will hear me.

                    My  beloved  love,  if  after  praying  with  all  the  good
               disposition and with the greatest trust I do not receive these
               graces and mercies, or I think of not receiving them, all this
               notwithstanding  I  take  vows  to  always  believe  your  true,
               infallible,  divine  promises,  imputing  to  my  unworthiness  and
               ill-dispositions the cause for not obtaining these graces and
               the mercies that I ask for myself and for others. Therefore, I
               will  humble  myself,  will  hope  and  strive  to  become  worthy,
               making my petitions through your merits, through the merits
               of your most holy mother, the angels, and the saints, as well
               as  through  the  merits  of  the  just  and  innocent  souls.  I  will
               always  firmly  believe  that  you,  most  liberal  Lord,  can  and
               want and will grant the graces, the mercies, and the celestial
               favors that I have asked, I am asking, and will ask.      581

                    Sweet Heart of my Jesus, even though you or your most
               holy mother or the angels or the saints do not hear, or repel
               my prayers seventy seven times seven, and quite the reverse
               of my petitions happens to me, I take my vow that my trust
               will  not  fail  with  your help.  I  will  hope  against  hope,  always
               asking  and  waiting  for  the  divine  mercies;  to  do  homage  to
               your  infallible  promises,  I  trust  and  will  trust  that  you  will
               always grant me more abundant graces than the ones I wish,
               hope, and ask.

                    I  base  this  unlimited  vow  of  trust  in  your  infinite
               goodness  upon  your  divine  merits,  on  your  most  holy
               mother's, on the angels', and on the saints' merits as well as
               upon  the  just  and  innocent  souls.  My  Jesus,  please  accept

               granting what I am asking, or you do otherwise, or I do not
               understand that you are granting the favors.

                    O most loving sweet Heart of Jesus, 0 most immaculate

               tribulations, in the doubts and want surrounding me, I come at
               your feet, expecting your help and the appropriate providence
               with humble, loving confidence. So that my confidence may
               never  fail,  because  of  my  frail  nature,  at  your  feet  I  take
               explicit vow of never distrusting, nor yielding to diffidence in
               the midst of want, disappointments, failure, and persecutions,

               piety  of  your  most  benign  Heart,  as  well  as  in  the  gentlest
               motherly  charity  and  in  the  compassion  of  the  immaculate

               institutes that you have guided and protected until now with
               many wonders of your power and mercy.

                    Meanwhile,  my  Lord,  I  bind  myself  to  never  be  dis-
               heartened  in  the  fulfillment of  this  vow,  because  of  my  sins

               covering it with your divine merits and by atoning it with your
               Most Precious Blood.

                    My beloved Lord, please accept this vow and lock it in
               your most loving Heart and in the immaculate Heart of Mary;   583
               please help me observe it exactly in the most embarrassing
               situations, even when you have brought us to the hell's doors
               and  almost  to  nothing;  then,  please  see  to  it  that  full  of
               humble trust, hope, and confidence I may have the living faith
               that  you  can,  want  and  will  save  us  unexpectedly  even  by
               working miracles of omnipotence and mercy! Amen!

                    I say one Hail Mary to the most holy Virgin, asking her to
               bless this vow, to help me fulfill it faithfully, to hope against
               hope,  and  to  present  it  to  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus.

               superior,  as  well  as  our  director,  guide,  and  teacher.
               Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus,  please  accept  our  proclamation
               and our pious intention. From now on, please put in motion
               our  proclamation,  direct,  and  guide  us  in  the  spiritual  and
               temporal life, in the observance of your law, in the exercises
               of holy virtues, in the works, thoughts, words, and intentions.
               Guide us in every least action, in the community's acts, in the
               observance  of  discipline,  in the  offices,  studies,  vigil,  sleep,
               and in everything.

                    Sweetest  Eucharistic  Heart,  because  we  know  and   585
               perform your will through holy obedience, we promise to stay
               in everything under holy obedience in order to attain the great
               favor we are asking. We will perform everything we are told or
               commanded to do as it were commanded or told by yourself.
               We  will  see  your  divine  presence  in  each  of  our  superiors,
               holding  them  as  your  representatives.  We  will  consider  our
               major superior as your vicar, obeying, respecting, and loving
               him  as  such  with  reverent,  filial,  and  confident  affection,
               because  you  have  established  the  direction of  the  souls  on
               earth so, in your infinite wisdom, and we are pleased by that.

                    Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus,  from  now  on  we  will  do
               nothing,  not  even  to  take  a  step,  nor  make  a  gesture,  nor
               breathe  a  sigh  without  being  perfectly  dependent  on  you.

                    Entrusted to your infinite goodness, O Eucharistic Heart
               of Jesus, we ask for an additional favor in order to crown the
               ineffable grace we have implored.

                    We know that the most holy Virgin Mary, our mother, is
               one with you, and her immaculate Heart is one with your most
               holy  Heart;  that  your  flesh  in  the  most  holy  Eucharistic  is
               Mary's  flesh,  and  your  blood  is  Mary's  blood;  and  that  the
               mysteries  of  your  grace  and  love  are  brought  about  in  the
               holy  Church  through  Immaculate  Mary.  For  that  reason  we
               ask you to confirm Our Lady as our sweetest mother, as you
               did  from  the  cross;  we  also  beseech  you  to  give  us
               Immaculate  Mary  as  our  absolute,  immediate,  and  effective   586
               superior, as well as our guide and teacher so that she may
               guide, correct, teach, and lead us in your name and behalf,
               making  us  fulfill  your  divine  will.  By  doing  your  most  holy
               mother's will in everything, and by living under her obedience,
               we will perform everything according to your most holy will, O
               Eucharistic Heart of Jesus.

                    O most adorable Lord Jesus Christ, the graces we are
               asking  with  this  petition  are  sublime;  and  yet,  despite  our
               demerits  and  indignity,  we  hope  to  receive  them  from  the
               sweetest, infinite goodness of your Eucharistic Heart we are
               entreating  in  the  greatest  manifestations  of  its  love  and
               mercy,  firmly  hoping  that  you  will  hear  our  prayer.  Amen.

                    The present and the future Rogationists by the Heart of
                    Jesus.

                    B) PETITION to the Immaculate Mary so that she may
               constitute  herself  for  ever  absolute,  effective,  immediate
               guide and teacher of the Rogationists by the Heart of Jesus,
               for the Eucharistic Heart's sake.

                    O  sweetest,  loving  Immaculate  Mary  our  mother,  you
               come  to  dwell  with  us  through  this  sacred,  beautiful,  and
               merciful  statue  on  the  solemn  day  when  we  commemorate
               your gentle visit to St. Elizabeth, greeting you as the Mystical
               Dove in the cleft of the rock. As humble congregants  of the
               least order of the Evangelical Rogation by the Heart of Jesus,
               we kneel at your motherly feet and entreat you to present our
               petition  to  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus  so  that  he  may
               constitute  himself  as  our  immediate, absolute,  and  effective
               superior,  as  well  as  our  guide  and  teacher.  Please  present
               this petition to him. Ask him to accept it at the height of his
               infinite  mercy,  and  to  place  it  in  the  opened,  wound  of  his   587
               loving  Heart  blazing  with  eternal  charity  in  the  sacred  pyx.
               Please tell him to grant it in full.

                    We  entreat  you,  O  immaculate  mother,  to  crown  this
               ineffable grace by obtaining from your adorable son that you
               too  may  constitute  yourself  as  our  immediate,  effective
               mother superior, as well as our guide and teacher. O beautiful
               Mother of God and our mother, we know that you are God's
               own will, lighter than a down, moving at any light breeze of
               the  divine  absolute  power.  Please  place  us  under  your

               as  under  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus'  command.
               Immaculate Mary, behold! We put ourselves, the present and
               the  future  Rogationists  in  your  hands.  We  promise  perfect
               subjection and obedience to]]></page><page Index="588"><![CDATA[you,  who  are  our  loving,  absolute,  effective,  and  immediate

               obedience  is  appreciated  by  you,  unless  we  obey  our
               legitimate  superiors,  we  promise  to  consider  them  as  the
               representatives  of  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  and  your
               representatives. As for the government of this least order, we
               promise to hold the major superior, whoever he may be, as
               the vicar of the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus and your vicar, and
               the other directors, as vice-vicars.

                   O  most  holy  Immaculate  Mother,  please  ratify  and
               confirm  our  complete  surrender;  take  complete,  immediate,

               8, fifty years after your Immaculate Conception's dogma, the
               houses  of  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  by  the  interests  of
               Jesus'  Heart  proclaimed  you,  O  Immaculate  Mother,
               absolute,  effective,  and  immediate  owner,  superior,  and
               teacher,  but  always  mother.  Since  then,  you  have  shown
               through  several  signs  that  you  have  accepted  that   588
               proclamation  by  constituting  yourself  owner,  teacher,  and
               superior general and particular of that community and of the
               future ones. What about the miracle you worked in the house
               of  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  in  Trani,  (2)  through  this
               sacred statue Then, you showers yourself to be really mother,
               teacher,  and  immediate  superior:  mother,  because  you
               rushed  to  help  a  wailing  creature  struck  by  an  incurable
               disease. You said: « Daughter, get up; I have healed you. »
               Then,  you  signed  her  with  the  cross,  adding:  «  I  bless  and
               restore you to health. » In a moment, the sick daughter was
               free from disease. Teacher, because you brought everything
               to  a  successful  conclusion  through  holy  teachings  of  pru-
               dence and discipline. Effective and immediate superior,]]></page><page Index="589"><![CDATA[because you called one sister by name at midnight, telling her

               and  to  praise  the  Lord  all  night  long  before  the  Holy
               Sacrament, which they did.


                    O  sweetest,  loving  Immaculate  Mother,  not once  but  a
               thousand  times  we  proclaim  you  absolute,  immediate,  and
               effective mother, owner, teacher, and superior together with
               the  most  holy  Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus.  We  firmly  trust  in
               your  motherly  sweetest  charity,  being  sure  that  you  will  not
               repel this humblest petition on this day, which is three times
               most  solemn  for  us.  On  the  contrary,  we  trust  that  you  will
               accept  it,  as  you  accepted  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal's

               deserve  such  an  ineffable  grace,  but  we  exhibit  the  divine
               word which came from the divine zeal of Jesus' Heart: « Pray,

               the  soil.  Please  make  us  grow  in  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of

               you  has  accepted  and  granted  our  petition  through  your
               powerful intercession, we ask no supernatural signs like the
               miracle you worked in Trani. We ask you instead to heal our
               souls  from  the  bad  inclinations,  to  purify  us  from  sins,  to

                         Resolves and prayers to the child Jesus

                    O sweet Jesus, you exhorted us to become like children
               to  be  worth  entering  the  kingdom  of  God.  We  make  any
               resolve  and  effort  to  become  children  by  innocence  and
               simplicity. Please help us with your grace!

                       1. Children believe everything.

                    O  my  adorable  child  Jesus,  I  firmly  believe  what  you
               have revealed and the holy Church teaches; I also believe the
               legitimate  superiors  and  counselors  that  instruct  and  guide
               me.  O  Lord,  confirm  me  in  the  simple,  pure  faith.  Amen.
               Glory.

                       2. Children keep no grudge.

                    O my beloved child Jesus, I promise to never keep the
               least  grudge  or  malevolence  against  those  who  displease,   595
               contradict, offend, trouble, oppose, or persecute me. On the
               contrary,  on  occasion  I  will  return  good  for  evil.  Please
               confirm me in this holy resolve! Amen. Glory.

                       3. Children do and think of what they are told.

                    O  beloved  child  Jesus,  I  want  to  be  docile  and  man-
               ageable  like  a  child  in  the  moves  of  your  grace  and  in  the
               inspirations  of  your  divine  will.  I  want  to  do  quickly  and
               docilely what I am told by those who direct and govern me in
               your name. Amen. Glory.

                       4.  Children  love  very  much  their  parents,  brothers,
                       and sisters.

                    O  my  beloved  Jesus,  according  to  your  command  I
               promise to love you with all my mind, with all my heart, and
               above  all  things,  as  well  as  my  sweetest  mother  Mary,  the
               angels, the saints, and my neighbor as myself. O]]></page><page Index="596"><![CDATA[Lord, infuse and increase this most holy love in me. Amen.
               Glory.

                       5. Children do not mind worldly matter.

                    O  my  divine  savior,  child  Jesus,  I  declare  that  worldly
               matter,  which  concerns  so  much  the  mundane  is  as  non-
               existent or like dissipating smoke for me; you alone are my
               treasure. My Jesus, let it be so for ever. Amen. Glory.

                       6. Children say things with simplicity and sincerity.

                    My beloved Jesus, I propose to never lie, to confess my
               faults  candidly,  and  to  conceal  no  wrong  with  excuses  or
               deceit.  O  Lord,  help  me  always  to  speak  and  work  with
               simplicity. Amen. Glory.

                       7. Children forget insults.

                  O my Jesus., I promise to never remember any wrong that
               people can commit against me; when such a thought crosses
               my mind, I will drive it away immediately;  furthermore, I will   596
               behave  with  the  people  who  eventually  wronged  me  as
               though  they  did  nothing  to  me.  Please  confirm  my  resolve!
               Amen. Glory.

                       8.  When  children  are  given  gifts,  they  rejoice  inno-
               cently and are fond of the donors.

                    O  beloved  Jesus,  I  promise  to  rejoice  in  you  for  any
               spiritual or temporal good given to me by your charity; I will
               seize this opportunity to love you more with perfect gratitude.
               My Jesus, let it be so! Amen. Glory.

                       9.  When  children  are  attacked,  they  rush  to  the
               bosom of their parents.

                    O my adorable savior Jesus, I firmly resolve to appeal to
               your  sweetest  Heart  and  to  our  most  holy  mother  Mary's
               Immaculate  Heart  when  the  hellish  enemy  assails  me  and
               when my soul runs any risk. My beloved Lord, help me keep
               my word. Amen. Glory.]]></page><page Index="597"><![CDATA[10. Children cry when they do not see their parents.

                    My beloved sweetest Jesus, I will never stop crying for
               the least of my faults which take you away from me. Please
               return to me everytime I call upon you with contrition. Now I
               promise to do my best to let you always stay with me. Please
               help me to always do so! Amen. Glory.

                       11. When children see their parents crying, they too
               cry; when they see their parents rejoicing, they too rejoice.

                    O my supreme good, child Jesus, I wish my eyes were a
               fountain  of  tears  to  bewail  together  with  you  and  with  Our
               Lady in sorrow my sins, the sins of the whole world, and the
               ruin of so many souls! I want to feel no other joy in my heart

               faith; I also want to go with you and with the most holy Virgin
               to  the  places  where  you  have  been,  beginning  with
               Bethlehem up to the Calvary. I wish I were with you in all the
               tabernacles. Please accept such a company on earth in order
               that I may be always with you and with the divine mother in

                    O  divine  child  Jesus,  help  me  to  imitate  in  everything
               your divine virtues, such as: humility, obedience, innocence,
               simplicity,  charity,  and  your  divine  Heart's  meekness.  I
               promise to do it with all my heart, all life long. Please help it

                       15. Children keep the baptismal innocence.

                   O child Jesus, I will never stop bewailing the loss of holy
               innocence  you  gave  me  in  baptism.  O  divine  child,  please
               return  it  to  me,  because  I  am  ready  to  do  the  sacramental
               penance and any other penance which is necessary to regain

               you are the only one who knows the hearts; to tell the truth, I
               would deserve a sentence for several faults and for my bad
               innermost.  I  promise  to  form  no  bad  opinion  of  the  people,
               and when I am unable to excuse their actions, at least I will
               excuse their intention. Please help me keep my word! Amen.
