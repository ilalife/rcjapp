Gaetano                Ciranni, is the second issue of the recent series Quaderni di “In Cammino” (Notes “Along a                Journey).                        In Cammino (Along a Journey) is a magazine, conceived as a supplement to the Studi                Rogazionisti, is born as an aid to Rogationist formation, i.e., to accompany the new phase of                the  ongoing  formation  desired  by  the  IX  General  Chapter  (1998)  and  promoted  by  the  X                General Chapter (2004) with the approval of the Project of Rogationist Ongoing Formation                drawn  up  by  the  Government  General  during  their  six-year  term,  1998-2004.    So  far,  the                magazine, which has been published without a precise chronological deadline but occasionally                as needed, has come out with two initial issues (Supplement to numbers 65-66 and 67 of the                Studi Rogazionisti) and several special issues dedicated to particular moments of formation at                the  level  of  the  Congregation,  such  as  the  annual  Conference  of  the  Superiors  of                Circumscription (2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008),  the International Meetings of Formators                (2002, 2005, 2008), and the Seminars on the Rogationist Priestly Alliance (2007-2008).                       The new series, which always pursue formative goals, are published research studies of                individual Rogationist confreres who want to offer their organic and systematic contribution                on the topics on Rogationist Formation.                                                                                                             8","Notes on the English edition                 1. Citations                      a. Quotations from Church documents are taken from official translations as published in                       http://www.vatican.va.                      b. The English translation of Bible quotes are taken from the Revised Standard Version.                         In his writings, the Founder quotes the Bible in Latin using the Vulgate version. Some                       of these, particularly the Psalms, do not correspond to the current chapter and verse                       numbering. In these cases, the English translation is taken from the Duoay-Rheims 1899                       version.                      c.  The  Author  wrote  these  Notes  in  2010.  Understandably,  he  was  quoting  the                       Constitutions and Norms of the 1980 and 1998 editions. For integration, this English                       edition also reports texts of the current Constitutions of 2010 in some related topics.                      d.  Quotations  from  the  Declarations  and  Promises  are  taken  from  Appendix  I  of  the                       English edition of the Constitutions of 2010. Most of the quotations from the documents                       of the Congregation are taken from the official English translations but retaining the                       reference to the pages in the Italian original.                2. Editor’s Notes                      a. The translators and editor have included in the English edition some notes which they                       deemed important to better render the meaning of a term, expression, or context. In-text                       notes are enclosed in parentheses, ex. (= word), while the footnotes are marked with an                       asterisk and EN for Editor’s Note (* EN:).                                                                                                       9","Foreword                         I often read manuscripts for publication.  But since I am not “in charge of the works,” I                always do it with some difficulty, mainly for lack of time, but sometimes also for the nature                and content of the texts. However, it was not for this volume.  I was immediately attracted to                it. First, for the topic itself, because it concerns me as a Rogationist; but also for its style: clear,                passionate, and engaging.                        The topic is all contained in the title: The Rogate: Charism of the Rogationists.                       The style is immediately indicated by the subtitle: Notes, Testimonies, Teachings                        On the meaning of the title, or the subject of the volume, there is nothing to clarify.  The                reader who belongs to the Family of the Rogate immediately guesses what it is.  And for those                who, although with a Rogationist background especially the young ones, would not be able to                understand it immediately, they will have a precise idea reading through the text.                       It is proper, however, to say something about the subtitle. I do so by asking the reader                the same questions that emerged spontaneously to my mind after reading it:  which notes, which                testimonies, whose teachings are contained in it?                       Certainly,  they  are  those  of  St.  Hannibal  Mary  Di  Francia,  the  Founder  of  the                Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal. The author himself said it in the introductory                notes: “The reflections develop in a particular way around citations taken from the Writings of                                                                                                         *                the Founder: both because we find in them the exact terms for the understanding of the Rogate ;                and because, being mostly autobiographical, they project the image of the charismatic Head,                of the one who has identified himself as an absolute and all-encompassing manner with the                Rogate, and therefore, represents the model that the Rogationist must imitate.”                        The book, however, is not a collection of writings of the Father Hannibal Di Francia.                Rather, they constitute the main source which the author refers to in the development of the                topic that continually leads back to the thought and experience of our Holy Founder.                        So, the notes, testimonies, and teachings in the subtitles are also those of the Author of                the book.                                            **                       Fr.  Gaetano  Ciranni,   in  fact,  knows  well  the  life  and  thought  of  Father  Hannibal                because he has long scrutinized latter’s writings and assimilated their spirit in his research and                prayer.  It should also be noted that he was the Superior General of the Rogationists for two                consecutive  terms  right  after  the  Vatican  Council  II,  the  time  when  religious  life  was                characterized by a profound renewal through the return to the sources and the search for the                original charismatic inspiration. Precisely at that time, Fr. Ciranni distinguished himself by his                passion  and  knowledge  in  reflection,  in  the  updating  of  the  charismatic  identity  of  the                Congregation, and his apostolic choices.                        His thought on the Rogationist charism is recorded in his various teachings when he                was the Superior General, in his contributions to the drafting of the various General Chapter                documents and the fundamental articles of the current Constitutions, and now also in this book                  *  EN: St. Hannibal Mary’s expression intelligenza del Rogate is literally translated into English as the intelligence                of the Rogate. This English edition translates it as understanding of the Rogate.                * * EN: Fr. Gaetano Ciranni (September 24, 1920 – July 26, 2014) was the Superior General of the Rogationist                Congregation  from  1974  to 1986.  This  year  is  the  first  centenary of his  birth,  in  the occasion  of  which  the                publication of this English edition is dedicated.                                                               10","in which he collects and transmits his long experience of Rogationist life.  Here, in a particular                way, he offers a well-articulated synthesis of the charism in its historical and evangelical origin,                in its theological, spiritual, and apostolic elements.  The reflections that he proposes are often                original and unprecedented, uniquely his thoughts, that makes him a qualified “master” of the                Rogate.                       Moreover, the nature and objectives of the book can be better understood if one takes                into  consideration  the  context  in  which  it  was  written:    the  Rogationist  novitiate.    It  is                therefore about a text that has not been elaborated over a writing-desk, but it came out from a                lively  encounter  with  the  young  people  eager  to  know  the  Rogationist  religious  life  in  its                evangelical,  historical,  and  charismatic  foundations.    The  various  chapters,  in  fact,  are                originally oral conversations that the Author defines simply as “some basic considerations on                the mystery of the Rogate.”  The process for the publication has not changed the original nature                of the texts.  They retain the freshness and immediacy of a conversation, characteristic of notes                for lessons.                        Who are the readers of the book?  I would spontaneously say the Rogationist novices,                the novices of the Daughters of Divine Zeal, the formators. Certainly, this is true, given its                origin. I am convinced, however, that this is for everyone.  In the field of formation, in fact,                we always remain “novices,” because according to the teaching of the saints, Father Hannibal                included, we can, and we must start anew every day.                       We are, therefore, thankful to the Author for these lessons on the Rogationist charism                held  at  the novitiate  and which now, in  the form  of a book, become teachings for all the                members of the Family of the Rogate:  the Religious and the laity. We are all the more grateful                when we take into consideration that the transformation of these notes for an oral lecture into                chapters of a book, took place during the period of particular physical suffering that limited the                activities of Fr. Ciranni.                       This circumstance makes this publication even more precious because it gives the value                of witnessing and transmission of an experience of life, so that the new generations, above all,                may  know,  welcome,  and  live  the  Rogate  as  a  “special  vocation”  for  the  coming  of  the                Kingdom of God.                                                                                  Antonio Fiorenza                                                                                       11","Introduction                         This issue contains simply the reflections I made in the meetings with the Rogationist                novices on the charism of the Rogate, handed over by the Holy Spirit to St. Hannibal Mary Di                Francia, who has institutionalized it in the foundation of the Congregations of the Rogationists                and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                        The main purpose for which they were written was to allow the recipients to continue                to reflect during the study hours on the various points discussed during the oral conversations.                        These are some very elementary considerations, for basic knowledge of the charism that                defines the identity of the person consecrated to the Rogate, which should be the object of his                study, prayer, and life beginning from the novitiate.                        Some, because many others can and must be done on the Rogate-mystery, which among                the founding charisms, is distinguished by its essentiality in view of the coming of the kingdom.                        Elementary,  because  the  Rogate,  indeed,  for  its  exceptional  soteriological  traits,                requires  an experts’ scientific research.  At present,  there are many  written and published                studies  on  the  charism  of  the  Rogate  in  various  articles,  doctoral  theses,  and  conference                proceedings, organized and celebrated by the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                        The reflections develop in a particular way around citations taken from the Writings of                the Founder: both because we find in them the exact terms for the understanding of the Rogate;                and because, being mostly autobiographical, they project the image of the charismatic Head,                the  one  who  has  identified  himself  as  an  absolute  and  all-encompassing  manner  with  the                Rogate, and therefore, represents the model that the Rogationist must imitate.                       There is no lack of references to the Magisterium of the Church and especially to that                of Paul VI and John Paul II, the Pope who proclaimed our Founder as a saint and, on various                occasions, addressed messages to the Rogationists.                       The frequent recurrence of some citations and concepts is intentional, either because                they are placed in different and complementary contexts and perspectives, or because they are                of fundamental importance.                        I consider the insistence on some particular topics (Eucharist, holiness, spirituality, etc.)                as necessary to create among the young who are just starting their iter in the basic formation,                the conviction that for an authentic, conscious, and integral growth in their vocation to the                Rogate, it is necessary to offer them a habitat endowed with the characteristic elements proper                and connected to the charismatic proprium, according to the understanding, teachings, spirit,                and experience lived by our Holy Founder.                   Who are the recipients?                       The title [The Rogate: Charism of the Rogationists] could be misleading.  The Rogate                is not a private charism, an exclusive property of the Rogationists.  It is a gift that Christ has                given  to  his  Church,  through  St.  Hannibal,  who  repeatedly  reiterates  that  no  faithful,  in                whatever state of life and personal vocation, can exempt himself from the command to pray                the Lord of the harvest to obtain good laborers (cf. chapters. 23.2 and 29.5); and he himself                moved  heaven  and  earth  so  that  the  evangelical  Rogation  would  become  universal  and                unceasing (cf. chapter 29).                                                               12","Who then, are the Rogationists? All those who share and live the Rogate according to                the understanding and teachings of St. Hannibal.  They are:                        1.  The  members  of  the  Religious  Congregations  founded  by  St.  Hannibal,  the                           Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal. In these pages, [unless they are                           expressions  and  statements  that  have  specific  and  exclusive  reference  to  the                           priesthood] whatever is said of the Rogationists applies also to the Daughters of                           Divine Zeal in the absolute sense.  It is because the Daughters of Divine Zeal has                           the same Founder, the same charism, the same vows, the same spiritual patrimony,                           the same spirituality, and the same mission.                        2.  The Missionaries of the Rogate, lay women consecrated to the Rogate.                        3.  The Bishops, priests, religious of other Congregations who are members of the                           Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations.                         4.   The lay people enrolled in the Union of Prayer for Vocations.                        5.  Other  Lay  Organizations  included  in  the  U.A.R.  (Union  of  Rogationist                           Associations).                        At the charismatic level, they all are on the same level, even though they differ in ways                of embodying the same charism: the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal in a radical                form and all-encompassing way through the bond of religious profession;  the laity in ways                that vary according to the state of life and social status, and as indicated in their respective By-                Laws.                        The Constitutions and Norms of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal and                the By-Laws of the other associative expressions, in relation to the Rogate, indicate the same                obligations: to pray – to spread the prayer – to be good laborers.  In fact,                         1.  They refer to the same charism, the genetic point, and the inspiring principle of all                            their activities.                         2.  They pray to the Lord of the Harvest with the same prayer commanded by Christ                            to obtain good laborers for his harvest.                        3.  They express the same mission of spreading the Rogate and apostolate of charity                            in favor of the little ones and the poor, according to their respective By-Laws.                       Thanks to this complementarity in diversity, each member of the various categories                establishes an organic relationship with all the others who follow the “Christ of the Rogate”,                to form a single Family of the Rogate in a charismatic dimension.                       It is enough to read the Table of Contents to understand that all members of the Family                of the Rogate can use the reflections contained in this book, even though the style and treatment                of the topics highlight the original nature and purpose of the work, i.e., intended for the novices                who are preparing for the religious profession; and thus, they are the first recipients.

The Charisms                          Before starting this reflection on the Rogate, the founding charism of the Rogationists,                I consider it is useful to recall briefly some fundamental concepts about charisms in general,                the charismatic dimension of the Church, and the charism of the “consecrated life” as such.                These notions are closely and fundamentally connected with the charism of founders.                       The term ‘charism’ comes from Greek charisma, [from the root: charis = grace], which                means ‘free gift.’ In the New Testament – except for 1 Pt 4:10 – only Paul used the term                ‘carisma.’                       The CCC in no. 799 defines charisms as follows:  Whether extraordinary or simple and                humble, charisms are graces of the Holy Spirit which directly or indirectly benefit the Church,                ordered as they are to her building up, to the good of men, and the needs of the world.                       Charisms are supernatural gifts of the Spirit. It should not to be confused with natural                gifts, talents, and abilities that a person can possess; or with the infused virtues; or with the                sanctifying grace (gratia gratum faciens), a gift given to all by the Spirit in Baptism, primarily                for the sanctification of those who receive it.  St. Paul teaches that the charisms are given                gratuitously and freely by the Spirit to the person for the good of all, i.e., they are essentially                ecclesial gifts that are ordained for the building up of the Church, the mystical body of Christ.                         For as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same                function, so  we,  though  many,  are  one  body  in  Christ,  and  individually  members  one  of                another. Having  gifts  that  differ  according  to  the  grace  given  to  us,  let  us  use  them:  if                 prophecy, in proportion to our faith… (Rm 12:4-6; cf. Eph 4:15-16)                       Vatican Council II teaches:                       It is not only through the sacraments and the ministries of the Church that the Holy                Spirit sanctifies and leads the people of God and enriches it with virtues, but, “allotting his                gifts to everyone according as He wills (cf. 1 Cor. 12:11), He distributes special graces among                the faithful of every rank. By these gifts He makes them fit and ready to undertake the various                tasks  and  offices  which  contribute  toward  the  renewal  and  building  up  of  the  Church,                according to the words of the Apostle: “The manifestation of the Spirit is given to everyone for                profit” (1 Cor 12:7).  [LG 12].                       In Baptism, Christ takes us ontologically to form an organic unity joined in his name                by the bond of love, each working with his own charisms, for the good of the whole Mystical                Body: As each has received a gift, employ it for one another, as good stewards of God’s varied                grace (1 Pt 4:10).                        Theologians  define  these  charisms  as  gratiae  gratis  datae  [graces  freely  given],                purposely for the use of others.  The charisms can be:                     a.  “personal and temporary” (cf. 1 Cor 12:4-11): The utterance of wisdom, the gift of                        healing,  the  power  to  work  miracles,  the  discernment  of  the  spirit,  the  varieties  of                        tongues, the interpretation of the tongues. The Spirit freely gives them as he wishes                        depending on the need of the Church.                                                                    15","b)  \"personal and permanent\" (cf. 1 Cor 12:28): Therefore God has placed some in the                Church first as apostles, second as prophets, third as teachers; then come the miracles, then the                gifts of healing, the gifts of assistance, of governing, of tongues.                        Saint Paul deals with the theology and ecclesiology of charisms in chapters 12, 13, 14                of the First Letter to the Corinthians.                       What  and  how  many  charisms  has  Father  Hannibal,  our  Holy  Founder,  received?                Certainly, more than one.  At this moment, we are interested in the charisms that refer to the                Rogate, the charism of the religious Congregations he founded; concerning which, he received                the charism of the founder and that of foundation.                        But even before these charisms, he has received from the Spirit the personal, permanent,                and extraordinary charism of the understanding of the Rogate, i.e., the interpretation of the                Rogate-Word.  We  can  also  say  that  he  had  the  charism  of  “hermeneutical-key”  for  the                comprehension in the fullness of the truth of the Rogate-Word.                       CCC No. 66 reads as follows:                               Yet even if Revelation is already complete, it has not been made entirely                       explicit  [i.e.,  thoroughly  explained,  understood,  developed];  it  remains  for                       Christian faith gradually to grasp its full significance over the centuries.  Jesus                       said about the Holy Spirit: But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide                       you to all truth…he will glorify me because he will take from what is mine and                       declare it to you (Jn 16:13-14).                       The charism of the Rogate falls into the category of the “private revelations”, but it has                a public purpose, in as much as it is essentially of interest to the whole Church.                                                                                            1                       Let us not enter into a discussion on the Catholic doctrine on revelation.   Let us simply                say that the Holy Spirit gave our Founder the understanding of the Rogate-Word, which until                then, no one has had it.  The Holy Spirit through an immediate communication to the intellect                of Hannibal, the man chosen by God, removed the veil that covered the depth of the Rogate-                Mystery, the originating-cause of both the charism of the founder and the founding charism.                                                 Revelation and mystery are topics amply discussed by Mario Di Pasquale in Intelligenza e Zelo del Rogate, in                1                Quaderni di “In cammino” n. 1, 2009, Rome.                                                              16","2. Charismatic Dimension of the Church – States of Life                          Before the Vatican Council II, the theologico-pneumatological aspect of the Church                was little considered.  The Church was defined as societas perfecta (perfect society), or worse,                societas inequalis (hierarchical society), considering the clerics and the laity as two unequal                categories, placed on different levels.                       Pope John Paul II during the World Congress of the Ecclesial Movements held in Rome                for Pentecost of 1998 affirms:                        There is no conflict or opposition in the Church between the institutional dimension [=                hierarchical structure of the Church] and the charismatic dimension, of which the movements                are a significant expression. Both are co-essential to the divine constitution of the Church                founded by Jesus because they both help to make the mystery of Christ and his saving work                present in the world (“Avvenire,” May 28, 1998, p.17; www.vatican.va).                        With the Vatican Council II, we became aware that with baptism, all the members of                the Church participate in the priestly, kingly, and prophetic office of Christ, with equal dignity.                No one, whatever the gift received, must be considered superior to others. We are all on the                same level with different ministries (cf. LG 32).                       In analogy with the body, even the ecclesial body involves a diversity of proper and                complementary positions and functions.  Thus, the distinction between the laity, the clergy, and                the religious, is only functional, according to their own charisms.                       From this derives the various charisms and the theological foundation of the different                “states  of  life”  in  the  Church  (cf.  Rm  12:4-5,  1  Cor  12:29-30;  Eph  4:11-12);  where  each                member  has  his  own  personality  and  a  specific  mission,  secundum  mensuram  donationis                Christi [according to the measure of Christ’s gift] (Eph 4:7).                       The Council distinguishes the baptized into three fundamental constitutive categories                of Church:   Clergy, laity, religious, to which the Lumen Gentium dedicates respectively the                third, the fourth, and the sixth chapters. Three Synods of bishops were organized to deepen                theologically and ecclesiologically these three categories, respectively.                     a.  The vocation and mission of the laity in the Church and in the world (October 1987),                        which produced the Apostolic Exhortation of John Paul II, Chirstifideles laici [CFL],                        of December 30, 1988;                    b.  The formation of priests in the present circumstances (October 1990), followed by the                        Apostolic Exhortation of John Paul II, Pastores dabo vobis [PdV], of March 25, 1992;                    c.  The consecrated life and its mission in the Church and in the world (October 1994)                        followed by the Apostolic Exhortation of John Paul II, Vita consecrate [VC], of March                        25, 1996                       All three constitutive states of life of the people of God represent the three fundamental                charisms of and in the Church. They are brought into being by their respective consecrations:                the laity, consecrated with the sacrament of baptism; the clergy through the sacrament of Holy                Orders; the religious in the profession of the evangelical counsels. We read a summary of the                composition of the Mystical Body of Christ in the CFL.                                                                  17","In Church Communion, the states of life by being ordered one to the other                      are  thus  bound  together  among  themselves.  They  all  share  in  a  deeply  basic                      meaning: that of being the manner of living out the commonly shared Christian                      dignity and the universal call to holiness in the perfection of love. They are different                      yet complementary, in the sense that each of them has a basic and unmistakable                      character which sets each apart, while at the same time each of them is seen in                      relation to the other and placed at each other’s service [CFL, 55b].                        The  laity  has  a  secular  character,  the  clergy  the  ministerial,  and  the  religious  the                conformation to the virgin, poor and obedient Christ.  In nos. 31 and 32 of the VC, the Pope                expounded the specific functions of the three states of life.                                                                                                                                   18","3. The Charism of “Consecrated Life”                          Consequently,  to  what  was  mentioned  above,  consecrated  life  as  such  has  its  own                typical charismatic identity, regardless of the multiplicity of charisms proper to every religious                institute. That the state of the consecrated life in itself is a charism is repeatedly reaffirmed by                John Paul II in the Apostolic Exhortation VC, which begins with these words:   The consecrated                life, deeply rooted in the example and the teaching of Christ the Lord, is a gift of God the Father                to his Church through the Holy Spirit (LG 43).                        In no. 2 of the same document, we read: We are aware of the treasure which the gift of                the consecrated life in the variety of its charisms and institutions represents in the ecclesial                community.                        No. 3 brings back the affirmation of the Synod.  At the Synod, it was stated on several                occasions that the consecrated life has not only proved to be a help and support for the Church                in the past but is also a precious and necessary gift for the present and future of the people of                God since it is an intimate part of her life, her holiness, and her mission.                       Consecrated persons with the profession of the evangelical counsels, whatever their                specific charism may be, have the duty to re-present the chaste, poor and obedient Christ, as                the Vatican Council II attests: In the same way, the religious state accurately exemplified and                perpetually made present in the Church a form of life that the Son of God embraced when he                came on earth to do the will of the Father and proposes it to his disciples to follow (LG 44;                VC, 22).                       The charism of consecrated life constitutes the common and essential dimension of all                the Institutes. Every specific charism finds support, concreteness, and richness in the profession                of the evangelical counsels, which refer to the mystery of Christ, the totality of his person, his                following, and communion with him.                       The  insistence  with  which  the  Rogationists  speak  of  their  proper  charism  and  the                laudable commitment to study and to deepen it could lead to a risk of absolutizing it, losing its                due emphasis on the essential quality of the evangelical counsels and their related theological                and ecclesiological values.                        The understanding and knowledge of the Rogate cannot be limited to the fourth vow                but must extend to the vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience.                        The  Rogationist  must  refer  to  and  conform  himself  toward  Christ,  fully  living  the                mystery of the Rogate, embodying it in its concreteness and totality of the life lived by the                Word of God, who assumed a human face, the face of the chaste, poor, and obedient man.                        If the Rogationist wanted to limit his conformation to Christ only in the specific track                of the Rogate, leaving out the fundamental dynamism of the person of Christ (chastity, poverty                obedience), he would not only deform his identity but would completely nullify it.                        There is even more.  To the extent that the Rogationist is chaste, poor, and obedient, in                that measure, he elevates to the highest level the personal conformation to Christ, the attraction,                and witnessing the effectiveness of the distinctive consecration to the Rogate.  And vice-versa.                And this is not because our literature or the Magisterium of the Church impose it on us, but                because this is the way the Christ of the Rogate lived.  Such should existentially be the life of                                                                 19","the Rogationist, who wants and must be able to affirm with all sincerity:  for me to live is Christ                of the Rogate.                       We cannot ignore the teaching and example of our Holy Founder, Father Hannibal, who                imposed  on  himself  an  observance  of  the  evangelical  counsels  with  the  most  rigorous                radicality.  He lived them in holiness characterized by sensibility, spiritual finesse, and nobility,                reaching the highest peak of heroism, hardly found in other religious saints, as is found in the                autobiographical writings, various biographies, and many other testimonies.  The fifth of the                Declarations and Promises deals with the evangelical counsels with the expressions that recall                the need to live them without reserve and for supernatural motives.                       The identity of the Rogationist is the Christ of the Rogate; he achieves it when he lives                the dominant desire to reach the highest level of conformation and identification to him in the                totality of his person.  This demands above all the sublimity of the Rogate and its essentiality                for the coming of the Kingdom. The objective ecclesial importance of the charism of the Rogate                demands radical conformation to Christ, as can be deduced not only from how the Founder                                                                            2                embodied it but also from his constant and abundant teaching.                       The truth of the identity of those consecrated to the Rogate, which constitutes their                distinctive “Religious-ego”, comes from the totality of elements that are integrated into the                person of the chaste, poor, and obedient Christ, who proposes himself to Father Hannibal and                his  followers  so  that  they  would  re-present  him  in  the  Church  and  the  world  with  the                characteristic of the specific charism.                      2  Regarding Holy Chastity, what shall I say and what promises will I make for such an outstanding religious virtue                and vow? Ah, I recognize that this is that precious virtue which Jesus Christ the Lord brought to earth to give as                an endowment to His chosen Ministers and to those fortunate souls whom, in His mercy, He calls to a most intimate                union of love by way of the religious life. […] I recognize that a religious sinning against chastity, would render                himself unworthy to remain any longer in the Congregation: he would merit to be expelled. And the Congregation                which tolerates within its fold a member who has become so corrupt, or a Congregation in which God is offended                even secretly by this sin, will already have deteriorated in the sight of the Most High (Declarations and Promises,                V).                   May God grant that this Little Community be a chosen garden of pure lilies, pleasing to him.  Qui pascitur                inter lilia [He feeds among the lilies] (Ct 2:16). But if this should not be the case, let us pray to the Supreme God                that he destroys this little seed right at its beginning (Regulations to the Rogationist Postulants, 1898).                   In the draft of the constitutions of the Daughters of Divine Zeal, Father Hannibal defines the “Most precious”                vow of Chastity and he put in the first place of the priority list (Chastity, Poverty, Obedience) as opposed to the                traditional way, anticipating the Vatican Council II (cf. Draft of the Constitutions of the Daughters of Divine Zeal,                Jan 6, 1912).                   …With what concerns Holy Poverty, I declare to acknowledge it as the most precious pearl and as a solid                foundation not only of my vocation but also of the existence of the entire Institute. […] Consecrating myself to                this Institute, I intend to consecrate myself to evangelical poverty with great fervor and love, contemplating it in                the adorable person of Our Lord Jesus and the Most Holy Virgin. […] But if one relaxes in his love for the practice                of Holy Poverty, it is destined to failure and dissolution, as it happened miserably with many religious Institutes                (Declarations and Promises, V).                   Regarding Holy Obedience, I declare that this virtue forms the very life and existence of every Religious                Institute […] I firmly recognize that Holy Obedience is a virtue of perfect sanctification and perfect union with                God because by obeying the Superior and the Rule, one fulfills the Will of God perfectly (Declarations and                Promises, V).                    At the bidding of obedience, we must leave everything, even a work barely started, or a word we are about to                write, or a Glory be we are reciting (Regulations to the Rogationist Postulants, 1898).                                                                20","4. The Charism of the Founder                          The charism of the founder is absolutely a personal (therefore not transmittable) gift; in                this chapter, we will trace the figure of the chosen one to whom the Spirit has entrusted the                gift.                        We find the notes listed below, which connote the person of the founders of the religious                institutes, present precisely in the Holy Founder of the Rogationists, Father Hannibal.                        a)  The founder is a man whom God chooses, calls, and sends to collaborate with Christ                in the history of salvation.  The Holy Spirit who “spoke through the prophets”, speaks even                today through the founders, who can declare: factum est verbum Domini ad me dicens – [The                word of the Lord came to me saying] (Jer 1:4).                       The founder has the certainty, not the probability, that God spoken to him; and he hears                that word burning within him like a fire in his bones.  We read of Father Hannibal that that                word, Rogate, was a word dictated by the fire coming from heaven into his bones: de excelso                misit ignem in ossibus meis et erudivit me [from above he has sent fire into my bones] (Lam                1:13; Jer 20:9; AP, p. 107; cf. below, in 11.2).                       b) At the beginning of a Religious Institute, the first movement is made by the Holy                Spirit, who brings to the chosen one both the “charism of the founder” and the “founding                charism.”  The person is appointed by the Transcendent.  He feels the presence of the Spirit in                his life.  However, the perception and the assessment of the charismatic project are not usually                understood immediately in its totality.  But they acquire precise boundaries through historical                mediations, conditions, and contradictions.  As regards the concrete realization of the work,                the time frame is usually longer.                        c)  The most evident characteristic of a founder is the spiritual dimension.  He is a man                possessed by the Spirit.  Often, he is called a man of the Spirit, a historical vanguard of the                Spirit,  an  essential  historical  mediation  of  the  Spirit,  a  privileged  space  of  the  Spirit  (in                reference to Father Hannibal, cf. below in no. 11.2).                       d) Seized  by  Christ  and  rooted  and  built  up  in  him  (Col  2:7),  he  offers  his  total                availability to the inspiration of the Spirit. He allows the Spirit to guide him, and with the Spirit,                undertakes the function as the chosen instrument. In fact, the Spirit remains the main agent in                his life.                        e) The founder has the certainty and the firm conviction that it is God’s will to found a                particular religious congregation.  However, he can only have the objective certitude that it is                truly a divine inspiration with the approval of the competent authority of the Church.                        The Church has the responsibility to discern the authenticity of a founding charism that                should have specific essential characteristics.  We can find some of these in numbers 12 and                51 of Mutuae Relationes (MR):  1. A certain element of genuine originality for the spiritual life                of the Church.  2. A particular purposeful initiative.  3. Subordination to the sacred hierarchy.                4. A unique gift originating from the Spirit.  5. A profound passion of the soul to configure                oneself to Christ, to give witness to whatever aspect of his mystery.  6. A constructive love for                the Church.                        We perfectly find all these characteristics in the charism of the Rogate.                                                                 21","f)  The founder receives from the Spirit not only the charism of the founder and of                foundation but also the understanding of the elements of the specific spirituality, of the relative                mission within the Church, and the means to reach the goal.                        g)  The founder cannot but possess an eminent and exemplary way the cardinal virtue                of fortitude, sometimes even heroically.  Because of the good that the Religious Institute is                doing, the devil unleashes violent hurricanes against him and the nascent work, and not only                from the outsiders but sometimes even from the members of the same Institute.  Among the                characteristic  traits  of  the  Religious  Institute,  the  document  MR,  12  underlines…The  true                relation between genuine charism, with its perspectives of newness, and interior suffering,                carries with it an unvarying history of the connection between charism and cross, which […]                                                                              3                is supremely helpful in discerning the authenticity of a vocation.                       h) Another essential trait of the founder is fruitful paternity.  The founder is the first to                live the founding experience, he follows Christ in the charismatic distinctiveness in such a                radical, exciting, involving, and contagious way, to attract others to live the same experience.                Furthermore, he will personally inform and form the first followers about the terms of this                distinctive consecration.                        i)  Lastly, he and not others, must draw up the constitutions of the Institute, at least                dictating the fundamental guidelines on the nature of the Institute and the proprium of the                                  4                founding charism.                                             3                  In the Regulation of the Co-founders and Co-foundresses (November 8, 1910), Father Hannibal describes the                four struggles he had to bear:  diabolical, earthly, interior, and divine.                4                  Fr. Francesco Vitale (the first successor to the guidance of the Congregation of the Rogationists), who has                collaborated with Father Hannibal in drafting the Constitutions, did not do other than take the various Rules                written  by  the  Founder  which  are  evangelical  ideals  of  the  first  inspiration,  the  fundamental  directions,  the                unchangeable charismatic principles, and the specific mission and encoded them in the first Constitutions (1926).                Legitimately,  it  can  be  said  that  the  Constitutions  were  written  by  the  Father  Founder,  not  only  because  he                personally revised and fine-tuned the work of Fr. Vitale but also by virtue of the iter (process = indications of                Father Hannibal) followed by Fr. Vitale in elaborating it.                   In the Regulations and in the drafts of the Constitutions written for the Daughters of Divine Zeal and the                Rogationists, the Founder demonstrates a perfect understanding of the Rogate as a supreme means to obtain the                glory of God and the salvation of souls.  In these splendid pages, which will be completed with the ecclesiastical                approved in 1926, we read affirmations of enchanting clarity and precision about the specific charism.                                                               22","*                               5. The Charism of the Founder or the Founding Charism                          The  expression  charism  of  the  founders  appears  for  the  first  time  in  the  Apostolic                Exhortation of Paul VI, Evangelica Testificatio (1971).                        The charism of the founder is also said to be the founding charism of the Institute,                whether  communitarian,  collective,  or  apostolic.  Substantially,  these  terms  have  the  same                meaning, with some slight differences depending on the vantage point.                        The founding charism is the gift that the Spirit initially gives to the founder and, through                his mediation, to all those who join him to live the same experience of the Spirit, to respond to                God who calls them and to realize one’s vocation.                        We have also said that the founding charism is a gift.  But what does this gift consist                of? We can say, quite simply, that it consists of a particular aspect, virtue, and moment that                characterizes and specifies the unfathomable mystery of Christ in his earthly existence.                        We read an ample exemplification in MR, from which we take some citations.                       Indeed, the consecration of those professing religious vows is specially ordained to this                purpose, namely of offering to the world visible proof of the unfathomable mystery of Christ,                inasmuch as in themselves they really present [Author: today we prefer to say: “re-present”]                “Christ  in  contemplation  on  the  mountain,  or  proclaiming  the  kingdom  of  God  to  the                multitudes, or healing the sick and maimed and converting sinners to a good life, or blessing                children and doing good to all men, always in obedience to the will of the Father who sent                Him.” (LG 46; MR, 10).                        We may add:  or when seeing the abandoned crowds, he said:  The harvest is great…                Pray, therefore…                        There are many Religious Institutes in the Church, each differing one from the other                according to  its proper  character  (cf. PC 7, 8, 9, 10). Each, however,  contributes  its  own                vocation as a gift raised up by the Spirit through the work of outstanding men and women (cf.                LG 45; PC 1; 2), and authentically approved by the sacred hierarchy (MR11).                        The Council degree Perfectae Caritatis (PC) on the renewal of the Religious Life states:                […] in accordance with the Divine Plan a wonderful variety of religious communities has                grown up which had made it easier for the Church not only to be equipped for every good work                […] and ready for the work of ministry – the building up of the Body of Christ (cf. Eph 4:12)                (PC 1).                       The mysterious personality of Christ can be likened to a mosaic, where each founding                charism is a tile; or as a sturdy tree whose branches, different from one another, reveal the                overbearing vitality of the trunk, which makes its vital sap flow in all the branches.  It is an                                                                                                       5                evident sign of the extraordinary richness of the gift that the Spirit bestows on his Church.                  *  EN: The Author uses the term carisma fondazionale which is translated literally in English as foundational                charism. It is also translated as charism of foundation, which this English edition adopts in as much as it is the                term commonly used in the Church documents (ex. Vita Consecrata nos. 12, 36, 49, 61, 62, 72, 73, 79, etc.).                5                  The Congregation for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and the Society of Apostolic Life (CICLSAL) affirms                that we have today 71 Institutes of Contemplative Life, 246 timesmale Institutes, 1,347 female Institutes, 33                                                              23","Each Religious Institute, in the same manner that it has a proper denomination, has its                proper  physiognomy,  a  spiritual  face,  an  unmistakable  and  unrepeatable  identity,  which                distinguishes it from the others, and dynamically become part of the Church with its own (=                proprium) particular service or ministry for the edification of the Mystical Body of Christ.                        These  characteristic  elements  and  the  distinctive  traits  have  their  origin  in  and  are                intimately connected with the founding charism, by virtue of which each Religious Institute is                part  of  the  communal  structure  of  the  Church,  in  the  multiformity  of  vocational  projects,                establishing the broad and complementary diversity of ministries.                       The Vatican Council II and the subsequent Magisterium have addressed an urgent call                to the Religious Institutes to become aware and safeguard at all cost their specific charismatic                identity. The document MR, which is guiding us in our preliminary reflections, states in no. 11                that it is necessary to preserve the identity of each institute so securely, that the danger of an                ill-defined  situation  be  avoided,  lest  religious,  failing  to  give  due  consideration  to  the                particular mode of action proper to their character, become part of the life of the Church in a                vague and ambiguous way.                       Such a repeated insistence is justified by the fact that over the centuries many Religious                Institutes did not take their charism in due consideration, which had become a vague, indecisive                reality, not perfectly known, and thus, taken into little account.                       Before  the  Vatican  Council  II,  the  terms  charism,  spirituality,  identity,  vocational                proprium were mortified, if not ignored.  The Code of Canon Law and the ecclesiastical norms                which regulate the life and structure of the Religious Institutes were strictly juridical.                       Even the Constitutions were drafted according to the jurisprudence of the time, reducing                the duties to be assumed by the religious to a minimum for the purpose of inner tranquility                regarding the fulfillment of the vows.  It was not allowed at all to place in the text of the                Constitutions inspiring principles, quotations of the Bible, of the Councils, and the holy fathers.                        In our first Constitutions (1926), it explicitly said that to fulfill the vow of the Rogate,                it would be sufficient to recite even just once in the day the short prayer:  Domine messis, mitte                operarios in messem tuam [Send O Lord, workers to your harvest].                        Our Founder, who did not have the legalistic mentality of religious consecration, but                the “pneumatic” mentality that flourished after the Vatican Council II, had to exclude from the                main text of the Constitutions, and put in the appendix, the splendid pages on the assistance                and evangelization of the poor; this  text has  been included in  the appendix  of the current                Constitutions (2004).                       Because of this distorted view of the Consecrated Life, the Vatican Council II wanted                all  Institutes  to  celebrate  Special  General  Chapters,  with  the  intention  of  returning  to  the                sources, to rediscover and recover the exact terms of the original charism and its evangelical                experience lived and bequeathed by the founder.                        The Rogationists, too, celebrated the Special General Chapter in two periods, not so                much to rediscover but to deepen the Rogate and to re-elaborate the Constitutions according to                the new norms issued by the Church.                        The judgment expressed by the reviewer-editors of the Constitutions is truly flattering:                   Societies of Apostolic Life, and 60 Secular Institutes, with a total of 1,782. EN: This statistic should be updated                with the latest data.                                                               24","The 1980 Chapter spoke with such precision, depth, and understanding of the charism                of the Founder, a charism that is centered in an unequivocal way [not frequently found in the                history  of  the  Religious  Congregations]  and  sure  about  a  unique  theological  reality:  the                commitment of special consecration to follow Christ, chaste, poor, obedient in the lives of men                completely dedicated, by the special calling of the Spirit, to the grace of the Rogate.                                                                                                                                             25","6. Definitions of the Founding Charism                          We said that the charism is a gift of the Spirit; that the various charisms respond to the                unfathomable  mystery  of  Christ.  But  how  is  founding  charism  is  defined?  Scholars  of                Consecrated Life have formulated different descriptive definitions. We prefer to briefly analyze                what the Magisterium of the Church offers us in the document MR (SCRSI and of the Bishops,                1978) and, at a later stage, those elaborated by the Rogationist General Chapter of 1980.                        The  very  “charism  of  the  Founders” (ET 11)  appears  as  an “experience  of  the                Spirit”, transmitted  to  their  disciples  to  be  lived,  safeguarded,  deepened,  and  constantly                developed by them, in harmony with the Body of Christ continually in the process of growth.                “It is for this reason that the distinctive character of various religious institutes is preserved                and fostered by the Church” (LG 44; cf. CD 33; 35, 1; 35, 2; etc.) (MR, 11).                       First of all, the document states that the charism is an “experience”.   Let us immediately                say  that  the  concept  of  experience  is  very  complex.  It  is  not  possible  to  give  it  an  all-                encompassing  definition.  The  life  of  every  man  is  a  fabric  of  pleasant  and  heart-rending                experiences.  Even Jesus on the cross passed through the most tormenting experiences, in                feeling abandoned by the heavenly Father.                        In the spiritual sphere, the most beautiful experience is that of the saints who feel the                presence of God in their lives:  Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love                him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him (Jn 14:23).                        St. Paul offers us a genuinely emblematic example.  The Apostle was deeply in love                with Christ that he could say: it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me (Gal 2:20).                The breath of Christ is the breath of Paul. Christ becomes the subject of all Paul’s actions,                whose personality was not annulled, but is rather transfigured. We could define such experience                of Paul as “existential”.                       To this category belongs the charismatic experience lived by Father Hannibal in relation                to the Rogate and should also be the experience of all his followers.                       To experience the Christ of the Rogate is the Rogationist’s reason for living, as it was                in an absolutely all-encompassing way for the Founder (cf. below, in 13).                        It  is  an  experience  which  in  the  Johannine  language  is  identified  with  the  type  of                knowledge  that  is  not  only  placed  in  the  intellectual  sphere  but  expressed  in  an  intimate                personal relationship and “communion” (cf. 1 Jn 1:3), that is, a participation in the same life                (cf. Jn 15:1ff).                       From the definition, which is the object of our analysis, it is clear that the founding                charism is not a theory but a reality that was, in the first place, lived by the Founder and                transmitted  by  him  to  his  followers  to  be:    1.  lived,  2.  safeguarded,  3.  deepened  and                continuously developed.                                                                           26","7. The founding charism is a lived experience                         First of all, it must be lived. To live the same experience as the founder is the absolute                priority commitment and the basis of every other dynamism of the religious. But what does                living the experience mean? How does one live an experience?                        Let  us  get  back  the  two  terms  that  we  have  highlighted  and  underlined:  visible                witnessing and re-present (cf. above, in 5).                       We can reduce these two expressions to one: “re-produce”. To be able to re-present a                person, it is necessary, in some way, to reproduce him. In fact, ours is not just any witnessing                but a real, concrete, and visible witnessing. If it is not visible, then it cannot be a witnessing.                John Paul II exhorts the religious to give a significant witnessing, and he gives the reason for                it:                       Their lifestyle too must clearly show the ideal which they profess, and thus present itself                as a living sign of God and as an eloquent, albeit often silent, proclamation of the Gospel.  The                Church  must  always  seek  to  make  her  presence  visible  in  everyday  life,  especially  in                contemporary culture, which is often very secularized and yet sensible to the language of signs.                In this regard, the Church has a right to expect a significant contribution from consecrated                persons, called as they are in a situation to bear clear witness that they belong to Christ. Since                the habit is a sign of consecration, poverty, and membership in a particular Religious family,                I join the Fathers of the Synod in strongly recommending to men and women religious that                they wear their proper habit, suitably adapted to the conditions of time and place (VC, 25).                        The document Essential Elements of the Church’s Teaching on Religious Life (EE)                dedicates the whole of chapter 6 to the witnessing that religious must offer to the world.  It                reiterates several times that it must be a witnessing given certainly with words, but above all                with life. The first example of witnessing given in this document is that of Jesus, the witness                of the Father through the power of the Holy Spirit. It continues with the witnessing of the                apostles:                               That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen                       with our eyes, which we have looked upon and touched with our hands, concerning the                       word of life— the life was made manifest, and we saw it, and testify to it, and proclaim                       to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was made manifest to us— that                       which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you may have fellowship                       with us; and our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ (1 Jn 1:1-                       3).                        The  religious  must  relive  the  existential  project  of  Jesus,  not  only  through  the                evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty, and obedience but also by assuming and representing                in his life the particular aspect of the life of Christ, that responds to the charismatic elements                that define him in “being that Religious” and differentiating him from others.                       Christ is the truth of man.  He is the ideal of every Christian.  God has predestined us                to be conformed according to the image of his Son (Rm 8:29).  That means that our identity of                life is found in Christ, according to the specific vocation we have received.  The Christ of the                Rogate must be the truth of the Rogationist who is called to copy and re-present him in the                moment  of  seeing  the  crowds,  he  felt  compassion  for  them  because  they  were  tired  and                exhausted,  like  sheep  without  a  shepherd.    Then  he  said  to  his  disciples,  “The  harvest  is                                                                27","abundant, but the laborers are few! Therefore, pray to the Lord of the harvest to send out                laborers into his harvest” (Mt 9:36-38).                       In other words, he must reproduce in himself the image of the Christ of the Rogate in                order to live a new Christological existence in Him and with Him, and answer to the vocation                he has received.                       Christ, “the absolute Rogationist”, is not only the efficient cause, that is, the one who                calls and constitutes the being of a Rogationist.  He is also the exemplary cause, that is, he                presents himself to the Rogationist as the model to be imitated in the specific charismatic                identity. This process responds to the conformative dimension repeatedly underlined but John                Paul II in the VC: living and expressing this by conforming one’s existence to Christ (16); an                explicit desire to be totally conformed to him (18);  conformed to Christ, the prolongation in                history of a special presence of the Risen Lord (19).                       Every  time  the  Rogationist  pronounces  “Christ”,  he  almost  instinctively  adds  the                distinguishing element, “the Rogate”, just like the members of other Institutes add the trait of                Christ that defines their charism.                       It is evident, therefore, that the charism of the Rogationists and Daughters of Divine                Zeal is the Christ of the Rogate. It is not so much the command of Jesus that says:  Pray… but                it  is  Christ  who  commands  to  pray.  Our  Founder  did  not  dedicate  himself  to  following  a                command but to the following of Christ, who prays, commands, and sends.  The Magisterium                of the Church also highlights the same. The Vatican Council II, in unequivocal terms, affirms                that the fundamental norm of the religious life is the following of Christ, as taught by the Gospel                (PC 2). Obviously, each one will do it according to their own charism.                        However, we can safely continue to say - and we also say it in these pages – that the                charism of the Rogationists is the Rogate, provided that we give to this expression the objective,                authentic, and effective meaning.                                                                                                       28","8. The charism is a safeguarded experience                          The charism is a vital experience of supreme importance in the ecclesial point of view.                It must be safeguarded as the treasure in the field or the precious pearl (Mt 13:44-45).                        Father Hannibal has repeatedly affirmed strongly and richness of terms that the Rogate                is truly a priceless treasure:                           1.  A great revelation                           2.  Divine Word – the great Word                            3.  Divine command – Command of the zeal of the Heart of Jesus                            4.  One of the greatest mercies                           5.  Word and command of Supreme importance                           6.  Infallible remedy – great and universal remedy                            7.  Secret of all good works and the salvation of all souls                           8.  Great treasure and precious seed                        The command of the Christ of the “Rogate” is a word in the Gospel of Matthew and of                Luke, which the apostles have heard from the voice of Jesus. This word has been read and                reread since the apostolic times by the fathers of the Church, by numerous saints, and simple                baptized Christians, but no one before Father Hannibal had understood in its truth and purpose                that that command of the zeal of the Heart of Jesus is the great and universal remedy, the secret                of all good works and the salvation of all the souls.                        In the historic-temporal order, we can read in parallel:                        a.  the mystery of the incarnation of the Word and                         b.  the revelation of the Rogate.                       In fact, it can be easily observed on the one hand the incalculable distance of a thousand                years that transpired between the sin of Adam and the incarnation of the Word.  On the other                hand, the distance, evidently shorter than the previous one, but equally mysterious, between                the moment in which Christ commanded the Rogate and the historical understanding given by                the Spirit to Father Hannibal, who in his meditation on this mystery, could not but observe: as                if the Lord had placed his divine hand over it, to hide that sublime word, that divine command                (AR, 59).  Father Di Francia could not hide his amazement at the omission into which the                Rogate has fallen through time (cf. PS, Vol. 1, p 12).                        The Rogationists cannot but fail to raise a hymn of praise and thanksgiving to the Lord                for the great gift of the Rogate, a mystery of love and salvation. Together with Jesus, they sing                a joyful song:  I give praise to you, I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you                have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes. Yes,                Father, for such was your gracious will (Mt 11:25-26).                       But why particularly to St. Hannibal?  In his freedom, God gives his gifts to anybody                he wants to, and that gift of piercing through the divine secrets was not given to us. However,                we can make an analogical hypothesis. St. Paul states: But when the time had fully come, God                sent forth his Son, born of woman, (Gal 4:4). That is, when God decided the incarnation of the                                                               29","Word, in the plan of salvation, he created Mary.  St. Augustine said that Mary pleased God for                her virginity, and she conceived the Word by her humility. With the virginity and humility of                a woman, the time of the Incarnation of the Word were fulfilled.                        It is probable that when the “fullness of time” for the “understanding of the Rogate”                had come, God created Hannibal, the man who brought to the summit of human possibilities                the virtues of purity and of humility: and in faith, the Christ of the Rogate was incarnated in                Hannibal.                        Where and how should the charism be safeguarded? The more precious the treasure is,                the more secure the place where well-armed guardians keep it. The Founder, who had the                understanding of the theological and ecclesial dimension of the Rogate, in a letter addressed to                Fr. Bonicelli, writes: After this sublime Mercy of the One “qui spirat ubi vult, et humilia respicit                in Caelo et in Terra” [who blows where he wills and looks down on Heaven and Earth]  I feel                the duty in conscience to safeguard this divine deposit and to make it the same obligation to                all my successors (Scritti, vol. 37, p.30).                        He then addressed a heartfelt and dramatic appeal to the Rogationists, lest they become                unworthy of the great gift received from the Spirit.                        The time has come for the Word of the Rogate to be known, that this command must be                spread. The ineffable God has given this mission to us. But it will perish in our hands if we do                not form ourselves in the Religious Life. What did I say? Will it perish? We will perish! It will                triumph! God will snatch this precious gift from our hand and give it to others. “He will put                those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him                the  fruits  of  their  seasons”  (Mt  21:41).  Oh,  my  children!  How  can  we  think  of  the  many                unfortunate events and not faint in pain? Oh! Let us never make ourselves unworthy of such                ineffable mercy. To be worthy of it means becoming perfect religious by the observance of the                holy vows and rules. It is not enough to do promotions and Pious Unions if we do not totally                belong to Jesus […]. (Patronage of St. Joseph May 10, 1908, in Scritti, Vol. 57, p. 68)                         Belonging to Jesus means allowing oneself to be possessed by Christ.  Christ willingly                possesses the Rogationist who takes care of his Rogate, that is to say, by living his life through                the existential conformation to him, chaste, poor, and obedient; to reach that high degree of                holiness that the specific charism demands.  Holiness, in fact, is the strength and the power of                God, who chooses fragile and weak creatures for the great missions.                                                                                            30","9. The Charism is a deepened                                        and constantly developed experience                          We have repeatedly said that the mystery of Christ is unfathomable.  To reach its depth                is  impossible  even  to  the  select  intelligence  such  of  those  St.  Augustine  and  St.  Thomas                Aquinas.                        Precisely for this reason, we are exhorted to go forward without tiring, in all ways and                by all means, in deepening the knowledge of the Rogate, especially in the biblical-theological                and ecclesial dimensions.  As with all the mysteries, and so also for the Rogate, we realize that                it always reveals something new to the extent we want to know it better.  The document MR                no. 26 exhorts the Superiors should see to it that cultural updating and specialized studies taken                up by religious should deal with subjects pertinent to the distinctive nature of the Institute.                       Certainly,  Father  Hannibal  has  left  a  very  remarkable  charismatic  heritage  in  his                writings.  However, the commitments, efforts, situations, and struggles that he had to sustain                in order to carry on the nascent Works did not give him the conditions to elaborate a systematic                treatise.  It is an indispensable duty that his followers, favored by the development of the                theology of the Religious Life and charisms after Vatican Council II, must feel and assume.                       We  can  never  know  the  Rogate  enough  in  its  intrinsic  objectivity.  Therefore,  the                Rogationist, who has chosen it as his ideal that defines and determines his entire existence,                feels the need to have an absolutely correct, complete, in-depth understanding of it in all its                aspects and perspectives as much as it is humanly possible.                        In so far as the person consecrated to the Rogate, with the help of the Spirit, strives to                understand this charism intellectually, he will also express it at the experiential level. In his                life, he will generate a magnetic field toward which all his sentiments, thoughts, and actions                are directed. The “Rogate-charism” will be the treasure that attracts and satisfies all the real                and edifying needs of his person, according to the image-model of the Christ of the Rogate.                The  Rogate  will  be  loved  and  relished  in  the  commitment  of  the  charismatic  apostolate                expressed with the prophetic zeal and the caritas pastoralis of Father Hannibal for the glory of                God and the salvation of souls. Taken with this interest and for these purposes, the charism will                create in the Rogationist a “conviction” that reaches so strongly the depths of his being so as                to impose it on the intellect and draw the will and faculties to action.                                                                                          31","10. Nature and structure of the founding charism                          In the previous pages, we discussed the charism in general. In this chapter, we focus                our attention on the nature and structure of the founding charism. The Rogationist General                Chapter of 1980 (DC 94) formulated a fairly complete descriptive definition from a functional                point of view.                       It is the dynamic and inspiring principle that guides the religious life, spirituality, and                apostolic works of the Institute, which characterizes its physiognomy and specific service.  This                charismatic project, which is placed as a constitutive element for the life and growth of an                Institute, defines and realizes its own identity.                        According to this definition, the charism is an active principle, that is, a constitutive                element of the person consecrated in the religious state. It has the function of inspiring and                offering the reasons, intentions, and finalities that animate and inform his being and acting.                The charism, in fact, is the source of spirituality that qualifies the apostolic works of a specific                Institute and defines its internal features and its own identity.                       We could say that the charism creates almost a second nature.  It is inscribed within the                fibers of being, as if a new element were grafted in the central core of the person, in such a way                that the possessor of the charismatic gift acquires a new sensibility, industriousness, efficacy,                special energies, and the awareness of the demand of expressing the mission related to the gift.                By virtue of this gift, the religious sees and deals with everything according to the perspective                                                                                                        6                of the specific charism. This process is usually defined as “the incarnation of the charism.”                       Therefore, the Rogate is part of the structure of the Rogationist.  It is a constitutive and                essential component of the identity of the consecrated to the Rogate. It reaches the core of their                being, involving their whole existence because it is ontologically and dynamically rooted in                the baptismal consecration, operating in the consecrated a profound transformation, not only at                the juridical, moral, and psychological level, but also and above all at the Christological level                (cf. VC, 14). In fact, the Rogationist, within the context of the Church, proposes as a living                memory of the way of existing and acting of the Christ of the Rogate. In short, the incarnated                charism creates a special feature that characterizes the existence of the one who receives it. It                seems that this is an abstract discourse, but when one thinks of the life in the Spirit, which the                saints lived, that Father Hannibal has lived, the doubt ends, and amazement begins.                       Seen  in  the  perspective  of  the  Rogate,  Father  Hannibal  offers  us  a  harmonious                personality,  which  develops  with  an  exceptional  balance  and  manifests  itself  in  the  unity                absolutely  integrated  by  the  three  essential  components:  prayer  for  vocations,  zeal  for  the                diffusion of this prayer, and the apostolate of charity at the service of the least and the poor.                       At the theological level, the charism is the historical realization of a reality already                existing in the plan of God from eternity and entrusted to each consecrated to realize it in                history.                   6                  This analogy is quite appropriate for the understanding of the charism: that of DNA, a molecule within which is                enclosed the secret of life.  It brings with it the recorded genetic code, that is, the total configuration program of                the individual at the physical, psychical, intellectual, operational level, etc… Analogically, the charism-molecule                of the Spirit – is registered and transmitted to each member of a Religious Institute. It is the same genetic code                that defines the Institute’s identity, structure, spiritual physiognomy, mission, etc.                                                               32","Indeed, God did not create us in different times.  Since the beginning, His was a simple,                complete, definitive creation.  He did not give us first the body, then the soul, then the spiritual                power, then the religious vocation… and, in the end, the charism.  He has predestined us from                all eternity to be conformed to the image of his Son (Rom 8:29), according to the specific                charismatic connotation of the Christ of the Rogate.                       The person called realizes himself, according to the design of God, in an absolutely                original way, both in the sense of being an unrepeatable creature - God does not repeat himself:                everyone called has his face, his personal internal and external features; -  and, in the sense of                being called in the mind and the love of God,  he is placed at the origin, at the source of his                being, at the beginning (cf. Eph 1:4 = from the foundation of the world).                        The Founder of the Rogationists, St. Hannibal Mary Di Francia, lived this charismatic                reality in an experiential way. And when the theology of the charisms did not exist at all, he                was  already  able  to  make  such  an  important  truth  understood  by  people  whose  level  of                schooling  was  limited.  Decades  before  the  Vatican  Council  II,  through  similarities  and                comparisons, he taught the current theology of the charism in all its depths, with appropriate                use  of  terminologies,  respecting  the  cultural  levels  of  his  followers.  Let  us  read  some                profoundly autobiographical lines which underline the incarnation of the Rogate:                        … They gathered, we would almost say, from the adorable lips of the Divine Master                these ardent words [Rogate, ergo, etc.] that were meant to pierce into the inner core of their                spirit and the innermost fiber of their heart; while they are all of the Divine Rogate, while they                absorbed it as the hope of their existence in Jesus, his yearnings for the glory of the Father                and the salvation of souls (AR, p. 670).                       That divine word forms the distinctive character of this humble Institute (AR, p. 663).                       The special spirit [=spirituality] of this Institute is imbued by that word of Our Lord                Jesus Christ, Rogate, etc. (AP, p. 269; Scritti, N.I., vol. 10, p. 186).                        The two Institutes are born with the Rogate, in the Rogate, from the Rogate.                       The three prepositions:   with, in,  from  … give the idea of the three-fold baptismal                immersion,  which  enwraps  and  involves  the  consecrated  in  the  trinitarian  tridimensional                sphere, reason, and source of the Rogate.                       As  we  can  see,  the  charism  has  a  fundamental  importance;  from  it  originates  the                spirituality  and the type of  apostolate proper to  a  religious congregation, according to  the                understanding of the founder.                        This  is  the  reason  why  the  Christ  of  the  Rogate  is  the  leitmotif  of  the  Rogationist                literature and represents the unifying center of all formative interventions. Indeed, the Christ                of the Rogate is the truth of their identity, which characterizes and distinguishes them within                the ecclesial community.                                                                              33","*                     11. Father Hannibal historizes  the (inspiration of the) Rogate                  11.1. The Holy Spirit prepares Hannibal to receive the Rogate                                                                 This command which I command you this day                                                                  is not too hard for you, neither it is far off.                                                                              The word is very near to you.                                                                       It is in your mouth and in your heart;                                                                        so that you can do it. (Dt 30: 11.14).                                                  I have given them the words which you gave me (Jn 17: 8).                                                                     Your words were found, and I ate them;                                                                        And your words became to me a joy,                                                                    And the delight of my heart, (Jer 15: 16).                        In this chapter, we will make a short analysis of the second definition of the charism,                which the General Chapter of 1980 offers us.                       The founding charism is a gift of the Spirit, who illumines the one who receives it (=the                founder), with an irresistible intervention, in such a way that he surrenders himself totally to                follow Christ in the particular evangelical aspect and the specific mission reserved for him                (DC 92).                       Instead of theoretical considerations, I think it is more useful to read this definition in                the experience lived by Father Hannibal, the charismatic leader and model of the Rogationists                and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                       The charism, the gift of the Spirit, is a mystery at the supernatural level and becomes                history in the person who receives it:  the founder and his followers.                       Before anything else, it is good to realize how the Spirit prepares Hannibal to receive                the gift of the Rogate.                       Three  interior  movements  and  relational  behaviors  have  strongly  characterized                Hannibal since his childhood in view of the vocational project.                         1.  The holiness and the life of faith;                        2.  The sensibility, love, and compassion for the poor;                         3.  The intuition of the prayer to obtain good evangelical laborers.                       These three notes, together with the purity of life and with the humility in truth (cf. n.                8 above), made the soil suitable and fertile, where the Spirit planted the seed of the Rogate, to                produce – and what a produce – the hundredfold.                        EN: The Author used the verb storicizzare which is literally translated as “to historize”. It is means interpreting,                *                studying, explaining a phenomenon by relating it to the precise historical period in which it occurred.                                                              34","11.1.1  The holiness of life and the life of faith                        Holiness is the foundation on which the charism is built, bestowed by the Spirit for the                purpose  of  institutionalization  in  the  ecclesial  arena.  The  existence  of  Father  Hannibal  is                founded and develops on this essential rock. It is sufficient to underline the testimonies from                which it is inferred that he preserved his baptismal innocence until the last moment of his life.                His holiness was always growing, in the constant prayerful dialogue with Jesus in the Blessed                Sacrament, in the love for Mary, in the service of the least and the poor ones, in the struggles                against his passions, in the corporal penance and mortification.                       The holiness of life is an essential sign for the one consecrated to the Rogate. The Father                was deeply convinced that without it, the goal of the charism is wasted, and the Rogationist                becomes unfruitful.                       Hannibal had the moral strength to pray with the pious Israelite:                                And the Lord will reward me according to my justice; and will repay me according to                        the cleanness of my hands:  Because I have kept the ways of the Lord; and have not done                        wickedly against my God. For till his judgments are in my sight: and his justices I have not put                         away from me. And I shall be spotless with him: and shall keep myself from my iniquity. And the                       Lord will reward me according to my justice, and according to the cleanness of my hands before                       his eyes (Ps 17:21-25).                       Our Founder gave full and total adherence to the invitation that Paul addressed to the                Christians  of  Philippi:  That  you  may  be  blameless  and  innocent,  children  of  God  without                blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like lights                in the world, holding fast the word of life (Phil 2:15-16a).                   11.1.2. The sensibility, love, and compassion for the poor                       The episode of the poor beggar who was mistreated by the companions of Hannibal in                St. Nicolo’s boarding school in Messina is emblematic. Hannibal was just about seven years                of age at that time when he gave something to the beggar and lovingly comforted and kissed                him. It was not the only episode that showed his tender love for the poor. His mother said that                he needs to be watched over always because he would give everything to the poor.  To a woman                who knocks and asks for alms, he gave two silver coins he got as a gift from his aunt Luisa.                He brings a gatekeeper into their house to shelter from the cold and rain (cf. AP, p. 492).                  11.1.2. The intuition of the prayer to obtain good laborers                        At the time of our Founder, there was no lack of devotional books that offer to the                faithful an abundant choice of prayers for all occasions, needs, and circumstances. While still                an adolescent, Hannibal was astonished, felt sorry, and could not understand how prayers were                made for rain, for a good harvest, for the liberation from divine punishment, and for a hundred                of other needs, but could not find even one prayer to obtain priests. Clearly, Hannibal already                understood the value and, therefore, the necessity for priests for the salvation of souls.                  11.2.  The Holy Spirit enlightens and guides Hannibal                        This is how Hannibal Di Francia speaks of himself in the third person:                                                                   35","The Lord, in his infinite, gracious goodness, enlightened him about a great                       word of the Gospel, which contains the secret of the salvation of the Church and                       the society (AP, p 109).                                A young man, at the beginning of his spiritual life and when still knew                       nothing  about  those  divine  words  of  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ:  “Rogate  ergo                       Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam,” recorded in the Holy                       Gospel, had this predominant thought in his mind: to do greater good in the Holy                       Church, to save many souls, to extend the kingdom of God on earth, there is no                       other means more certain than the increase of chosen ministers of God, of holy,                       apostolic men, according to the Heart of Jesus.  Therefore, the best and effective                       prayer to be preferred would be to ask unceasingly the Most Holy Heart of Jesus                       that he may send on earth holy men and chosen priests, as in the times of St.                       Dominic and St. Francis, as in the times of St.  Ignatius, as in the days of St.                       Francis de Sales, St. Alphonsus and the likes.  This idea seemed very clear and                       indisputable (AP, p. 110).                               There  was  someone  who  paid  attention  to  this  divine  command,  even                       before he had read it in the Gospel, and started the journey of his life with this                       attention (AP, p. 110).                               Such attention was a divine inspiration that came to him at the beginning                       of his tender age: it was a great, sublime idea that came from the Spirit, that blows                       where it wills. It seems that the Spirit itself breathed on him at the beginning of                                                                                                  *                       his spiritual youth, many years before he started the Pious Work (AP, p.110).                       We have the testimonies of Fr. Vitale and Fr. Tusino, who, though differing about the                time (= of the event of the inspiration of the charism), both affirm that he heard an inner voice                telling him to become an apostle and propagator of the Rogate. “An inner voice”:  obviously,                the voice of the Spirit that decisively and strongly resounded in his conscience and directed his                existence, totally encompassing it in the commitment to live and propagate the Rogate.                       At this point, we need to take note a very important and decisive fact regarding the                authenticity of a founding and institutional charism. The documents of the Magisterium of the                Church, in order to ascertain their authenticity and guarantee, require some characteristic notes                (cf.  no. 4, e above). The first and the most essential is its unique origin from the Spirit.                       Father Hannibal wanted to have the objective certainty that his was indeed a divine                inspiration,  and  he  asked  and  eagerly  awaited  the  ecclesiastical  approval,  to  have  the                confirmation that everything truly came and proceeded from on high.  To the Visitation Sisters                he wrote (1919):  That Divine Spirit, that blows where it wills [“Spiritus spirat ubi vult], seems                to  me  to  have  given  the  initial  impulse  of  starting,  for  several  years  now  and  with  due                permission from the Ecclesiastical Authority, a Pious Work for the interests of the Heart of                Jesus.                        The citations reported in this paragraph outline the synthesis of the pneumatological                origin of the Rogate, which we find exactly in the vocation of Father Hannibal.  The iter of the                Founder develops essentially on the line of an intense and special experience of the Spirit, as                he affirmed several times when confiding to his first followers. We can also read this in his                    * EN: There is a play of words in the Italian original  ispirare (inspire) and spirare (blow, breath). Tale                attenzione fu una ispirazione divina, che lo prevenne nello sboccio dei giovani anni: fu un 'idea grande,                sublime, che lo Spirito, il quale spira dove vuole, pare abbia spirato Egli stesso…                                                              36","writings, which highlight in decidedly uncontestable terms that the Rogate is a charism coming                from the Spirit.                  11.3.  The Rogate, initially, was a divine inspiration                       From the words of Father Di Francia, one can draw in absolutely clear, precise and                unequivocal terms that initially, specifically during the prayerful ecstasy at the Church of St.                John of Malta (CSJM), he had a                        •  divine inspiration (AP, p. 110); the Spirit furthermore                         •  gave him the enlightenment on the great word of the Gospel (AP, p. 109).                       Father Hannibal had not yet read the logion of the Rogationist charism in the Gospel.                What he had at the CSJM was an intellectual knowledge that the Spirit gave him neither with                words, nor with a dreams, nor with apparitions, nor with any other external sign, but with a                true  and  proper  intellectual  illumination  (he  gave  him  enlightenment).  It  was  a  divine                inspiration, according to the teaching of St. Paul:  God has revealed to us through the Spirit (1                Cor 2:10).  We can rightly say that our charism is the intelligence (= understanding) of the                        **                Rogate.                 11.4.  The Rogate, afterward, was a gospel revelation                        When Father Hannibal read the pericope of the Rogate in the Gospels of Matthew and                Luke, he was surprised. Claiming with a deep conviction that it was a revelation, he writes:                               The  young  man  remained  surprised  and  absorbed  when  reading  those                       words of the holy Gospel: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few: pray,                       therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he may send out laborers into his harvest.”                                These two passages of the Holy Gospels [Mt 9:37-38; Lk 10:2] form a                       great revelation (PPA, 1919).                       It is not surprising if the Founder, in the same writing, would speak either of inspiration                or revelation.  He wrote this about thirty years after the event. In the PPA, he certainly does                not intend to make the chronology of historical events nor a theological analysis of the same                events:  therefore,  due  to  the  strict  connection  of  the  two  moments,  he  reduces  the  two                manifestations into a unity.                        However,  the  God  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  certainly  gave  the  Founder  a  spirit  of                wisdom and of revelation of the knowledge of him (Eph 1:17-18) of the charism of the Rogate.                        In  fact,  Father  Hannibal  is  deeply  convinced  that  the  divine  inspiration,  which  he                initially had in the CSJM, seemed to him very clear and indisputable; however, he had the                confirmation, guarantee, and absolute certainty after reading the logion in the Gospel: that                                                         7                reading was hearing of Christ's own voice.                  * * EN: Divine intelligence or divine understanding is brought about by the Holy Spirit’s gift of intelligence. It is                not a fruit of human intelligence and reasoning. As noted earlier, this English edition translates it as understanding                of the Rogate.                7                  As regards, the voice of Christ, probably the words of our logion are ipsissima verba Christi, that is the exact                word pronounced by Jesus, not only for the objective soteriological importance but also for the fact that both the                evangelists recorded it with absolutely the same wordings.                                                               37","John Paul II, in the “Bull of Canonization,” has synthesized what we have said in this                section:                               At a very young age, while in adoration before the Blessed Sacrament, he                       had the enlightenment, which we can define as the “understanding of the Rogate.”                       He  discovered  the  primacy  of  prayer  to  obtain  vocations,  which  became  his                       charism and the purpose of his life.   Afterward, he read the passage from the                       Gospel: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few:  pray, therefore, the                       Lord of the harvest to send out laborers in his harvest. (Mt 9:38; Lk 10:2).  In this                       way,  he  understood  the  Rogate,  not  as  a  simple  exhortation  but  an  “explicit                       command” of Jesus and, therefore, an “infallible remedy” for the good of the                       Church and of the society.                        Let  us  recall  some  citations  from  which  we  observe  the  surprise,  the  painful                astonishment of Father Hannibal, and the highest value of the Rogate in the plan of salvation.                                That word was there in the book of the Holy Gospel, recorded by two                       evangelists.  Thousands of Religious Orders and Congregations have devoutly                       scrutinized that divine book, taking as the norm of their institutions either one or                       other verses, passages, sentences, commands, and counsels.  But as if Our Lord                       Jesus had placed his divine hand over it to hide that sublime word, that divine                       command.  No one noticed it until the adorable Redeemer uncovered it to the most                       miserable  among  his  creatures.  He  pointed  it  out,  introduced  it  to  your  ears,                       imprinted it on your hearts, melted it in your lips, and placed it in your breasts                       together with his wounded and burning Heart (Speech for the religious investiture                       of the Daughters of Divine Zeal, St. Joseph 1908, In Scritti, vol. 45, 384).                                The  peoples  did  not  pay  attention  to  this  divine  command  and  have                       neglected it completely (Scritti, vol. 3, p. 39).                               Unfortunately, it is a painful mystery that no one paid attention to that                       word (Scritti, vol. 3, p. 42).                               It has remained a secret that we can say hidden because no one has ever                       given serious attention to it. […] For twenty centuries – this is the truth – the great                       word which is more or less an explicit and repeated command of Our Lord Jesus                       Christ,  remained  almost  buried  and  unnoticed  in  the  pages  itself  of  the  Holy                       Gospel (AP, p. 133).                                That word of Jesus Christ is a command of the zeal of his divine Heart, a                       word  and  a  command  of  greatest  value,  indeed,  an  infallible  remedy  for  the                       salvation of the Church and the society. The Rogate contains the secret of all good                       works and the salvation of all souls (AP, p.115).                              […] nobody should be surprised if Satan sees, as a consequence of the                       propagation of this divine prayer, the beginning of the destruction of his kingdom                       (AP, p. 115).                                                                            38","12. Date and place of the first inspiration                         But what is the date and place where the Founder received first “divine inspiration”?                When did this predominant thought flashed in his mind?                       Fr.  Francesco  Vitale,  Fr.  Teodoro  Tusino,  and  Fr.  Serafino  Santoro  were  the  most                qualified testimonies because they lived with the Founder in intimate communion since the                beginning  of  the  Congregation.  All  of  them  agreed  that  the  event  happened  when  Father                Hannibal was about seventeen years of age.                        Fr. Tusino, the first and the most accredited historian and bibliographer of our Founder,                testified in this way:                               […]  though  God  has  not  yet  made  known  his  voice  to  Hannibal,                      nonetheless, he already had the best condition to listen to it and follow it when it                      spoke to him: His heart was always raised on high and the thought of God was                      always dominant in him. He intensified his prayer and fortified his spiritual life.                      He  increased  the  frequency  of  his  visits  to  Jesus  in  the  Blessed  Sacrament,                      particularly when exposed in the Forty Hours. He grew in his love of solitude and                      recollection. He completely avoided the rare occasion of going to the theater, and                      he forever renounced the short hunting games with his relatives (MB I, p. 121).                        Furthermore:                             He has the pious habit of visiting the Blessed Sacrament exposed for the                      Forty Hours every day in different churches of the city (AP, p. 11).                       From this testimony, we clearly see that Hannibal collaborated with and offered to the                Spirit the best possible availability he had. The natural attitude went always purified, amplified,                and sublimated. A kind of permanent spiritual metabolism can be observed in him.  Fr. Tusino                added:                               The Father often told us that the first idea of the Rogate, i.e., the prayer to                      obtain priests for the Holy Church, although not knowing yet the Gospel passage                      that commands it, flashed in his mind while praying during the Forty Hours before                      the Blessed Sacrament in the Church of St. John of Malta when he was still a lay                      young man (MB I, p, 121).                       The expression the Father often told us (=ci diceva)  in imperfect tense indicates a                continuing action for which we suppose that it was not a secret said only once but many times                and not only to one of his followers and collaborators but to many (‘us’).  Therefore, the Spirit,                that leads the young Hannibal (without knowing yet the Gospel logion) to go in a Eucharistic                pilgrimage to various churches where Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament was exposed for Forty                Hours, stopped him at a certain point, at the CSGM, for the special infusion of the gift of the                Rogate.                       It was the charismatic Pentecost:  the descent of the Holy Spirit onto Hannibal, a young                lover of the Eucharistic, in a Eucharistic ambiance, in a Eucharistic moment. In the CSJM,                Hannibal receives the understanding of the charism, and the Rogate begins to dwell in his life                as a permanent grace.                        Obviously, Father Hannibal did not yet have the immediate and total understanding of                the charism, whether of the founder or that of foundation. Various situations and historical                                                               39","mediations gave him the complete knowledge and the possibility of realizing it in the Church                and for the Church, as reported in his biography and the history of the Congregation.                                                               8                       Let us focus our attention on the CSJM:  in this church, Father Hannibal had the first                idea of the Rogate. In this church, Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament implanted the seed of his                divine Rogate in the mind and heart of the Founder. Afterwards, through his ministry and his                mediation, the Divine Farmer […] came [in the Avignone Quarter] to cultivate himself his                small plant, which is buried in the soil of pain and mortification, where the seed of his divine                Rogate was enclosed (Regulations for the Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus,                Taormina, December 15, 1920).                       The seed contains the embryo of the future plant, the organism at the first stage of its                growth, as well as the vital energy and the potentiality of the fully-grown tree in the future.                Therefore, we can say that:                        1.  The CSJM is the place of our origin, of our charismatic conception.                        2.  In the historical journey of our charism, the CSJM represents the departure area,                           while the Avignone Quarter is the first stage of its development.                         3.  The river of the Rogate, which has its beginning in CSJM, after having bathed and                           purified the Avignone Quarter, has now reached the five continents.                        4.  The CSJM is the Horeb of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal, where                           Jesus in the  Blessed Sacrament told our “Moses”: I have seen the misery of my                           people  in  the  Avignone  Quarter…I  know  their  suffering…Now,  go!  I  command                           you…                        5.  The original reason for which our Institute can claim to be a Eucharistic is in the                            CSJM.                        6.  Precisely, because Father Hannibal had the first idea of the Rogate in the CSJM,                           during a prayerful ecstasy before Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, we find in this                                                                st                           church the root of the feast of July 1 , i.e., of Jesus who came in the hovels of                           Avignone Quarter as a King in the midst his people, as a Good Shepherd in the                           midst his fold, as a Loving Father, Divine Farmer.  But where did he come from?                           He came from CSJM.                       The CSJM is the place of the genesis of the Family of the Rogate, which includes those                who  are  consecrated  with  vows  to  the  Rogate:    Rogationists,  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,                Missionaries of the Rogate; the Sacred Alliance, all the members of the Pious Union of the                Evangelical  Rogation  (UPV),  the  Rogationist  lay  Associations,  to  whichever  group  they                belong, all the expressions of Rogationist apostolate in the double dimension:  Prayer and                Charity.                        The CSJM cannot just remain in the remote history, but it must assume its rightful value                in the present living memory of the Rogationists, in the same way as that of the Avignone                   8                  The CSJM was built circa VI century, as per tradition, by St. Placid, who was sent by St. Benedict to Sicily.  It                was destroyed together with Benedictine Monastery in 541 by the barbarians who killed St. Placid together with                fellow monks. After this barbaric attack, the Benedictines reconstructed the church and the monastery which was                devastated once again by the Saracens. In the year 1099, the church and the monastery were restored by Ruggero                the Norman, but it was ceded to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In 1588, the work of restoration started in                view of making it a cemetery where the holy martyrs are buried. The earthquake of 1908 destroyed the entire                central nave of the church. Only the apse remained from the big church which used to have a surface area of more                than 1,700 square meters. After the Second World War, it was restored by the municipal administration.                                                              40","Quarter.  The CSJM deserves the first place in the priority of values, both in the geographical                                                       9                and, above all, in the charismatic levels.                                                                     9                  For all the reasons enumerated above, it would be desirable that, with whatever juridical title, the Rogationists                should come into possession of the CSJM, to make it a place of perpetual adoration for vocations.                   The ecclesial moment is exceedingly favorable.                   On December 8, 2007, the prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, Claudio Card. Hummes, sent a letter to                the  Bishops,  wherein  among others,  he  suggests  to  bring about  a  connection between perpetual  Eucharistic                adoration for the sanctification of priests and the initiation of a commitment on the part of consecrated feminine                souls – following the typology of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of the Eternal High Priest, and Helper in his                work of Redemption – who might wish to spiritually adopt priests in order to help them with their self-offering,                prayer, and penance […] We are asking, therefore, all diocesan Ordinaries who apprehend in a particular way                the specificity and irreplaceability of the ordained ministry in the life of the Church, together with the urgency of                a common action in support of the ministerial priesthood, to take an active role and promote – in the different                portions of the People of God entrusted to them, – true and proper cenacles in which clerics, religious and lay                people – united among themselves in the spirit of true communion – may devote themselves to prayer, in the form                of continuous Eucharistic adoration in a spirit of genuine and authentic reparation and purification.                   Benedict XVI, in his Apostolic Exhortation Sacramentum Caritatis (67), writes:  Here, I would like to express                appreciation and support for all those Institutes of Consecrated Life whose members dedicate a significant amount                of time to eucharistic adoration. In this way, they give us an example of lives shaped by the Lord's real presence.                I  would  also  like  to  encourage  those  associations  of  the  faithful  and  confraternities  specifically  devoted  to                eucharistic adoration; they serve as a leaven of contemplation for the whole Church and a summon to individuals                and communities to place Christ at the center of their lives.                                                              41","13. From the Church to St. John of Malta                                              to the Avignone Quarter                         The charism of the Rogate entered the history of the Congregation in two moments and                two different places. We already have described the                            st                        -  1  Moment: 1868. The Spirit led Hannibal to the Blessed Sacrament exposed for the                Forty Hours in CSJM in Messina. Here, our Founder, who was still a young layman, received                the understanding of the charism and conceived the Rogate in his mind and his heart. Here                starts his spousal adventure with the Christ of the Rogate.                            nd                        -  2  Moment: 1877.  The Spirit – through Zancone – led Hannibal, who was already                a deacon at that time, to the Avignone Quarter. He showed him the abandoned crowds who                were like sheep without a shepherd. They were the poor and the little ones, reduced to a life                                     10                without joy and hope.                       In the Avignone Quarter, the Rogate is born: nine years passed from conception (1868)                to birth (1877). A historical journey, which we could ideally configure as a bridge that lies on                two  pillars.  The  first  is  the  CSJM,  and  the  second  is  the  Avignone  Quarter.  This  bridge                eliminates the distance and unites the two pillars (which symbolize the two dimensions of the                Rogate: oratio and actio) in the essential charismatic unity.                       In fact, in the CSJM, the Spirit entrusted to Hannibal the prayer to obtain laborers for                the  abandoned  crowds.  In  the  Avignone  Quarter,  the  same  Spirit  entrusted  to  him  the                abandoned crowds.                       In the Avignone Quarter, the evangelical scene is repeated: the vision of the crowds,                the cry of the Rogate, the answer to the command of the Lord. In the Avignone Quarter, we                have the first actualization of the two dimensions of the Rogate: the prayer for vocations and                the works of charity in favor of the little ones and the poor. Here, the little ones and the poor,                the object of charity (Hannibal, like Christ, teaches, preaches, and cures) become the subject                of the prayer commanded by Christ. The little ones and the poor become the first praying                community, the first choir ever of the Evangelical Rogation.                     10                   The Avignone Quarter, where no one dared to set foot, became a citadel of Father Hannibal, the object of his                compassion, the launching pad of the Rogate and his pastoral ministry for vocations. Father Hannibal writes:  I                was still a deacon when, by chance, I happened to enter the Avignone Quarter, which became a disgrace for the                entire city. I was struck by the sight of so much misery and neglect: illegitimate unions, children immersed in the                mud, girls exposed to (=moral) danger, older people dying on bare and damp ground. […] it was a moment that                recalls the passage of the Gospel: those crowds were like sheep without a shepherd (PPA, 1901).                   The condition of the roads in that slum area is very pitiful, particularly during winter, when they form large                puddles due to the lack of drainage and rotting garbage and trashes of every kind […].  Those miserable people                lived amid rags and rubbish everywhere, where most disgusting insects swarm, so much so that an older man died                there, devoured (= by insects); and this is not an exaggeration. […] More miserable was the moral condition of                those poor souls, composed of a hundred people, around 30 to 40 families without civil and religious bonds. It is                easy to understand: in such a condition of material and spiritual deprivation, without the light from the Christian                morals, without the decorum of civility, what could that place be, if not the reign of vice?  (MB I, p. 335ff)                   In the PPA of 1919, the Father writes in the third person:  He realizes that there could be no other better place                than this to do a little of charity out of pure love of Our Lord Jesus Christ, the Supreme Good.                                                               42","The  Avignone  Quarter  is  not  only  the  space  that  receives  the  expressions  and  the                operational dimensions of the charitable works but also the point of irradiation to the Universal                Church of the prayer commanded by Jesus. The poor of the Avignone Quarter are the forebears                of the Rogationists; they were the first Rogationist laity, who, catechized by Father Hannibal,                perceived and obeyed the command of the Lord.                       The Founder, speaking in the third person, says:                                He started the pious charitable works in those enclosed shanties with the                       principal plan of obeying more perfectly and religiously that divine command of                       the divine zeal of the Heart of Jesus: Rogate… It was too beautiful to see that the                       Evangelical Rogation to obtain good laborers for the Church resounds now in the                       tender voices of the children of the poor (PPA, 1901).                               This is how it pleased the Divine Mercy, who gazes at the little things in                       heaven and on earth (Ps 112:6), to entrust such a great treasure to this Pious                       Work of the little poor and orphans […].  This spirit of prayer soon became the                       spirit of this Pious Work, which forms its character, goal, and action (PPA, 1901).                       We  cannot  but  agree  that  if  CSJM  is  the  place  of  our  origin  and  conception,  the                Avignone Quarter is the place of our integral charismatic birth.                       We  can  conclude  by  affirming  that  the  CSJM  and  the  Avignone  Quarter  are  two                complementary points of the charismatic geography of the Rogationists, for the comprehension                of the mystery of our charism and the ecclesial service of the same mystery.                       Card. Ratzinger, in a homily delivered in the Rogationist Parish Church, in Piazzi Asti                in Rome on January 27, 2002, shared to us an original vision of Father Hannibal, within the                context of the Avignone Quarter.                               It is here that our Blessed was struck by the vocation, for which he became                       aware that he has to enter into that world, that he has to get out of his previous                       condition, that he has to repeat the exodus of Jesus, the exodus of his vocation:  to                       enter into that misery to bring a little of light […].  Blessed Hannibal, touched by                       the cry of Jesus “Rogate” – pray so that the Lord may send out laborers, to help                       these little ones who had no shepherd – joins the cry of the Lord and cries out to                       us even today: Rogate, pray.  But this entering into the cry of Jesus cannot be                       understood only as a simple word, but a word that works, that transforms the                       whole life. Father Hannibal prayed with his entire life, making himself a laborer                       of the harvest of Jesus, taking part in the work of redemption, of salvation.                       Struck by the vocation. In the Avignone Quarter, Father Hannibal understood that his                vocation was not only to raise his eyes above, offering the Lord the prayer for good laborers,                which  has  already  evidently  become  part  of  his  existence,  and  afterward  he  would  hear                resounding into his ears as the cry of Christ who commanded the Rogate.                        Card. Ratzinger affirms that in the Avignone Quarter, our Founder understood that he                must enter into the cry of the Lord.  But this time, the Lord cries with the voice of the poor with                whom he identifies himself.  Entering into the cry of the Lord means in that world, entering                into that misery to bring there a little light to collaborate with Christ by taking part in the work                of redemption, of salvation.                        That cry of the Lord was a resounding vibration that created, for Father Di Francia and                his followers, a new world, a new habitat:  the “promised land,” which is free from evil and                the intrusion of sin. This became a garden of bliss and the cenacle where it was too beautiful                                                                 43","to see that the Evangelical Rogation to obtain good laborers for the Church resounds now in                the tender voices of the children of the poor.                       As soon as Father Hannibal had the financial possibility, he bought those “hovels,” one                after another. But before doing that, he first conquered the hearts of the poor inhabitants of the                slums and prepared them to receive Jesus, who would come from CSJM.                       We might ask ourselves what effect the lightning that struck Hannibal with sudden and                intense enlightenment of mind produced in him. We can read the answer to this in his auto-                eulogy: For the Rogate, we say nothing: he dedicated himself to it, either out of zeal or by                fixation, or both (Scritti, N.I., vol. 7, p. 241).  The lightning has produced in him a fixation,                which the Founder, in his humility, wants to call it an obsession.  We give a very different                interpretation to it, which corresponds to the historical and personal truth of the Founder.                       In analogy with the chemical phenomenon that occurs in the photographic technique,                the light rays of the lightning produce on the sensitive support, which is his heart, a profound                and  indelible  fixation  on  the  word  of  the  Rogate.  We  cannot  help  but  bring  out  an                autobiographical citation:                               They gathered, we would almost say, from the adorable lips of the Divine                       Master these ardent words [Rogate, ergo, etc.] that were meant to pierce into the                       inner core of their spirit and the innermost fiber of their heart; while they are all                       of the Divine Rogate, while they absorbed it as the hope of their existence in Jesus,                       his yearnings for the glory of the Father and the salvation of souls (AP, p. 670).                       Words which are the perfect echo of what we read from the Deuteronomy: For this                command which I command you this day is not too hard for you neither is it far off… But the                word is very near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart, so that you can do it (Dt 30:11,14).                       Hannibal receives and welcomes the Word from the Spirit of Christ: for I have given                them the words you have given me (Jn 17:8) and he ate them (Jer 15:16)                        Zeal is born and is motivated by fixation and generates in our Founder the exceptional                apostolic activity full of stupendous initiatives.                        Cardinal Ratzinger said that the Founder cries out to us even today: Rogate. Obviously,                the  prayer  commanded  by  Jesus,  through  the  voice  of  Father  Hannibal,  i.e.,  through  his                teachings  and  his  example,  has  to  involve  the  whole  life  of  the  Rogationists  in  the  three                dimensions of the specific consecration, in an original and existential way. Our Founder is the                model, in whom “the Rogate universe” occupies all the spaces of the intelligence, conscience,                soul, life, prospects, plans.                        The Rogate is the central nucleus that connotes and defines the traits of his unrepeatable                and unmistakable spiritual-charismatic features. It is on the foundation of his religious and                apostolic experience, and characterizes his being and acting, as a believer, priest, and founder,                as a poet and beggar, writer, educator, an apostle of the prayer for vocations, and father of the                                     11                orphans and the poor.                       It  is  common  knowledge  in  what  terms  and  to  what  extent  Father  Hannibal  had                incarnated the Rogate. We can demonstrate this from the Forty Declarations and his parallel                autobiographical writings. Fr. Tusino says: The Rogate was the light on his path, the star of his                thought, the sun of his life.  He was born for that!  (AP, p. 106).                  11  Cf. G. Ciranni, Accolse il “Rogate” evangelico nella sua totalità radicale, in “L’Osservatore Romano. 23 aprile                1983.                                                               44","We can add other notes that emerge from his life, writings, and biographies:                         a)  Full awareness                        b)  Intuitive conscience                        c)  Creative, dynamic interpretation                         d)  Total availability                        e)  Specific and all-encompassing mission of his life                         f)  Law of his existence                        g)  Logic of his consecration                         h)  Meaning and reason for his life and apostolate                        i)  Strength  superior  to  his  own,  to  which  he  could  not  deny  his  unconditional                           obedience                         j)  The way being of his ideal self                       Alone, notwithstanding all the terrible struggles and the bitter persecutions (that could                have forced anyone else to paralysis), he launched his creative fantasy beyond all horizons and                achieved an incalculable volume of good in the charismatic field of the Rogate.                       We can affirm that Father Hannibal is the maximum possible re-presentation of the                “Christ of the Rogate.”                                                                                                               45","14. The Priestly-Religious Vocation                           The most natural wave carrier of the Rogate is no other than the priesthood. In fact, the                Rogate is the command that the Lord Jesus gave primarily to the Apostles and their successors.                It has as its finality to ask from the Lord of the harvest for good laborers, in particular, the                priests to whom Christ has entrusted his powers, his Eucharistic Body, and his ecclesial Body.                        The precise date when the young Hannibal heard the voice of the Lord calling him to                share in His priesthood as well as the date on which he received the charism of the Rogate from                the Spirit is unfortunately unknown to us. We have to content ourselves with approximations.                Fr. Francesco Vitale, the first successor and biographer of our Founder, puts it towards the end                of 1868, in the same year and place in which Father Hannibal had the understanding of the                Rogate at the CSJM (cf. F.B. Vitale, Canon Hannibal Maria Di Francia his Life and Works,                p. 36).  Fr. Tusino affirms and records that it happened in October of 1869, after reading the                life of St. John Berchmans, who had a significant influence on Hannibal, that he even decided                to become a Jesuit. He writes in MB I, p. 124: It is, therefore, to be believed that Hannibal had                a sudden and certain vocation in October 1869, and it was not only a vocation to priesthood                but also to religious life.                        Ultimately, Fr. Vitale seems to hold that Hannibal received the Rogationist vocation                and the priestly-religious vocation in a single historical moment, that is, precisely what he                experienced in front of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament in CSGM.  Fr. Tusino puts in two dates                the Rogationist vocation and that of priestly-religious vocation, which are about a year apart.                       Through  a  critical  analysis  of  the  life  of  Father  Hannibal,  of  his  writings  and  the                testimonies, the scholars will probably be able to determine with precision the two dates.                       The historical uncertainties are of relative importance to us today. One thing is sure,                theologically, the vocation of Father Hannibal – is one of a kind, uniquely Rogationist-priestly-                religious vocation.  If we eliminate even just one of these three essential components, we will                lose  the  authentic  and  original  vocation  of  our  Founder.  The  constitutive  elements  of  the                vocation merge into a single existential reality, not only in the dimension of being but also in                the dimension of acting. In the priest, in fact, the vocation to the priesthood and the vocation                to the consecrated life converge in a profound and dynamic unity (VC, 30).                       So,  regardless  of  “the  time  in  which”,  we  are  interested  in  the  “how”,  i.e.,  to  the                “vocational path”, which we find in the testimonies of Fr. Vitale and Fr. Tusino.                       Let us start with that of Fr. Vitale (Canon Hannibal Maria Di Francia, his life and                works, p. 36):                               One night, while praying, he felt strong impulses in his heart to consecrate                       himself to the Lord, to immolate himself to him and not to indulge himself in                       worldly affairs. When daybreak came, he rushed to the Church where the most                       Divine was exposed for Forty Hours, and he had to repeat this to Jesus in the                       Blessed Sacrament. “Loquere, Domine, quia audit servus tuus” [Speak Lord, your                       servant  is  listening].  And  he  listened  inwardly  to  that  voice  and  had  such  a                       brilliant light in his mind, a fire burning in his heart, that he himself did not know,                       or perhaps, did not want to express that experience.                                                                46","Such words offer us a splendid witness, richly articulated but complex and difficult to                interpret in all its depth and scope.  The reason is that in the citation, the presupposed dates of                both Fr. Vitale and Fr. Tusino conflict. According to Fr. Tusino, if the church referred to is that                of St. John of Malta, Hannibal was not yet thinking on that day of consecrating himself totally                to  the  Lord,  and  the  voice,  the  light,  and  the  burning  fire  are  exclusively  referred  to  the                understanding of the Rogate.                       However,  we  can  equally  make  reflections  on  the  brilliant  testimony  of  Fr.  Vitale,                which allows us to approach the vocation of Father Hannibal vis a vis some vocations in the                Bible.                        -  One night…                        One night, while a deep silence held all things captive, just as on the night of liberation                from the slavery of Egypt (cf. Ex 11:4) the mighty word from heaven, from the royal throne                (cf. Wis 18:14) was addressed to Hannibal, to bring it to the people who await the liberation of                Christ, the only Savior of the world, through the collaboration of Good Laborers to be obtained                with the Evangelical Rogation.                       One night, as in the night of salvation that we celebrate at Easter Vigil. The salvation                done by Christ that would be prolonged for centuries through the Rogate, which contains the                secret of the salvation of the church and the society (AP, p. 109).                        One  night,  the  night  of  betrayal,  (cf.  1  Cor  11:23)  during  which  Jesus,  before                surrendering himself to his executioners, gave himself to the disciples in the sacrament of love,                which  have  been  made  present  from  generation  to  generation  through  the  ministry  of  the                priests.                        One night, the night of the calling of Samuel, with the difference that the vocational                dialogue happened while Samuel was asleep and proceeded intermittently to the listening to                the voice that wakes him up. Instead, Hannibal was awake and felt strong impulses in his heart                in prayerful dialogue with the Lord.                       We will find other significant details when we read in parallel the vocation of Samuel                and that of Father Hannibal. In both,  the first  religious formation  has been given by their                respective mothers, then followed up, in the case of Samuel, in the temple under the care of a                priest, Eli, while that of Hannibal, in St. Nicolo’s boarding-school, under the guidance of Fr.                Foti.                        The dynamics of the two vocations are identical and unique. In fact, especially in the                biblical vocations in the Old Testament, the scheme of the biblical vocations usually develops                in four moments: calling, objection, request for a sign, acceptance on the part of the one called.                (cf. the vocation of Moses, the prophets, and also of Mary). In Samuel and Hannibal, there was                no objection, and there was no attempt of “escape”, but they accept the word with the docility                of a little child who does not pose any resistance.                         -  …while praying…                       It is God who elaborates the vocational plan; it is he who, in a prayerful dialogue, makes                the recipient understand the nature, its corresponding mission, the essential ways that should                distinguish his way of life in history and the Church.                       The strong impulses troubled Hannibal because he was not yet aware of the plan of the                Lord in a perfectly clear manner. After having felt the strong impulses, he could not wait for                the day to come, and perhaps he wanted to awaken the dawn (cf. Ps 56:9).  In fact,                                                                47","-   …when daybreak came, he rushed…                       to  the church where the Blessed Sacrament was exposed to  offer, like  Samuel, his                unconditional availability: Loquere, Domine, quia audit servus tuus.  Here the Founder had the                certainty of the vocation in its totality. The Lord spoke and Hannibal listened to the voice in                his heart, and had so brilliant a light in his mind, a fire burning in his heart.  The brilliant light                is in tune with the definition of the charism of the 1980 Chapter, reported above (cf. above, in                11), where it affirmed that the charism enlightens with irresistible intervention the one who                receives it.                        Let us go back to the vigil of Hannibal (while praying).  Certainly, that was not his only                nocturnal prayer. The gift of prayer that the Spirit has granted to the Father Di Francia is truly                exceptional in a manner that we can hardly find in other saints. If he suffered for the lack of                prayers to obtain priests, we cannot doubt that in that night, he prayed for the intention that has                always fueled the restlessness of his heart: to obtain holy priests. The Lord heard his prayers                and sent Hannibal himself to and for the universal Church; he was the chosen, virtuous priest,                with wisdom and natural intelligence. This profile corresponds exactly to that one sketched by                Father Di Francia in the stupendous prayer he raised to the Lord to obtain a holy priest for                Messina (cf. Scritti, vol. 1, p. 47).                       In the attempt to compare the vocation of our Founder to those in the Bible, let us                examine the testimony which Fr. Tusino writes in the MB I, p. 124:  Let us remember that the                vocation of the Father “was not ordinary,” as the Father told us and as Fr. Vitale underlines.                        Fr. Tusino himself, in the biography He Never Said No, recalls to us the following                revelation that the Father told him:                       My vocation had three characteristics:                        1) First of all, it was sudden. Although I liked a pious life, in those days when masonry                       and liberalism were dominant, I was not thinking of becoming a priest. Unexpectedly,                       the Lord sent me His light.                        2) It was irresistible. I felt that I could not escape from the power of grace. I had                       absolutely to surrender.                        3) It was very certain. After that light, I was absolutely sure that God was calling me. I                       could not entertain the least doubt that the Lord wanted me to follow that way.”                       The three qualities are similar to those we find in the vocation of Moses, Jeremiah,                Isaiah, and in the New Testament, that of the disciples, above all, of Paul whom Jesus calls to                follow him. Both in Paul and Hannibal, the calling is sudden.                       Both heard the voice, Paul from the outside, Hannibal from within.                       Both  were  enveloped in  the light; that of Paul  enlightens and blinds,  while that of                Hannibal enlightens with sweetness.                        Both have the certainty that Christ calls them, and neither resisted the calling. While                keeping full freedom, they felt an inner strength so powerful and fascinating that they cannot                help but follow Christ who is calling them.                                                                      48","15. The Christ of the Rogate in the Gospels                         We have already said that Jesus Christ is the ultimate Rogationist (cf. Ch. 7 above).                Father Hannibal and his religious are Rogationists by participation. We have also said that the                charism of the Rogationists is indisputably the Christ of the Rogate, re-presented and lived in                the ecclesial community.                        Since the Christ of the Rogate for the Rogationists is an efficient cause (that is,  he                brought the Rogationist to existence) and at the same time an exemplary cause (model of the                Rogationist), to conform their life to him, it is necessary that “those called to the Rogate” have,                as much as possible, a rigorously exact knowledge of his person and his mission. In this chapter,                we will sufficiently  focus our attention  and reflection on the Christ  of  the Rogate as it is                presented to us by the evangelists.                        To achieve this objective, we need to go to the evangelical contexts where Jesus shows                himself in the particular aspect that responds to the charismatic identity that the Holy Spirit                gave to Father Hannibal.                        We know well that the place of the identification of the Christ of the Rogate is found                       in Matthew:                                  And  Jesus  went  about  all  the  cities  and  villages,  teaching  in  their                       synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease                        and  every  infirmity. When  he  saw  the  crowds,  he  had  compassion  for  them,                       because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he                        said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;  pray                       therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest.” (Mt 9:35-                       38).                       And in Luke:                               After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them on ahead                       of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to come.                       And he said to them: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore,                       pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” (Lk                       10:1-2).                        They are passages that resonate in the Writings of our Founder and the Rogationist                literature with the dominant frequency and rhythm of a symphony. In them, we find the traits                that synthesize the image of the Christ of the Rogate, the habitat, the charismatic area of the                Rogationists, the evangelical genesis, and as well as the epiphany of being Rogationists.                        The synthesis of the image that expands in evangelical contexts, where our passages are                inserted or recalled, through feelings, attitudes, and apostolate of Jesus Christ. We can also say                that, for the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal, these two passages represent the                high point of the Gospel, from which they observe all the moments and movements of Jesus;                better still, they are the beacon that projects intense rays of light on his person and activity.                        The first place we have to visit is the synagogue in Nazareth; here we find Jesus, who                reads Isaiah 61:1-2:                                                                  49","And there was given to him the book of the prophet Isaiah. He opened the book                       and found the place where it was written, “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because                       he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release                       to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are op-                        pressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”  And he closed the book, and                       gave it back to the attendant, and sat down; and the eyes of all in the synagogue were                       fixed on him.  And he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in                        your hearing” (Lk 4:17-21).                        I believe that we do not force the text if we define this  quote as  “prophecy of the                Rogate,” considering the Rogate as the Word that Jesus Christ received from the Father and                that Jesus Christ himself prayed and lived (cf. 23.5; 29.10 below). Isaiah's passage is strictly                connected with the passage of Saint Matthew, where we find  poor, blind, oppressed, who                constitute the exhausted and abandoned crowds of whom Jesus Christ has compassion.                        In Isaiah, the crowds await the liberator; in Luke, “today”, the crowds are set free by                Jesus Christ, who officially proclaims in the synagogue of Nazareth the mission received from                the heavenly Father and presents himself as the one who was consecrated with the anointing                and sent out precisely to announce deliverance and salvation. Jesus Christ is aware of being the                “consecrated and sent by the Father”: this is his being; in fact, he defines himself thus when, in                controversy with his listeners, he declares himself as he whom the Father consecrated and sent                                                           12                into the world (Jn 10:36; cf. Acts 10:37-38).                       Before reflecting on the fundamental logion of our charism, I think it is necessary to                consider the mystery of consecration for two reasons:                       1.  The Rogationist is “consecrated” and “sent” like every other religious by virtue of                           the profession of the evangelical counsels, and he is even more so if, to the religious                           state is united with the clerical state with the sacrament of Order. Therefore, as such,                           he has the essential duty to configure himself to Jesus Christ: the Consecrated One                           par excellence and the Apostle of the Father (cf. VC, 9), the supreme consecrated                           and missionary of the Father for his Kingdom (cf. VC, 22).                       2.  A second reason is proposed by our holy Founder, who affirms with extreme clarity                           that the specific apostolate of the Rogationist consists in ut mittat prayer, so that the                           Lord of the harvest may call and send the collaborators of Jesus Christ to the work                           of salvation (cf. no. 22 below).                  15.1. The mystery of consecration                        The heavenly Father, who consecrated Jesus Christ, makes us share in the consecration                of his Son; in him and like him, we too are consecrated with the anointing for the kingdom.                       Saint Irenaeus affirms: The Spirit of God descended upon Jesus and anointed him, […]                so that we, receiving from the abundance of his anointing, might be saved (Irenaeus, Adv. Her.                III, 9, 3).                        God, the Father, who in baptism placed his seal on Jesus Christ (for on him has God the                Father set his seal [Jn 6:27]) will also put it on us. Saint Paul affirms: But it is God who                establishes us with you in Christ, and has commissioned us; he has put his seal upon us and                given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee (2 Cor 1:21-22).                     The expression has been sent was referred to Jesus in the Gospels 46 times: once in Matthew, once in Mark,                12                four times in Luke, and 40 times in John.                                                              50","The anointing and seal of the Spirit of which Paul speaks allude to the sacraments of                baptism and confirmation that all Christians receive (cf. Eph 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor 5:5).                       However, baptismal consecration does not exclude other considerations. Those who are                called with a particular vocation and mission receive from God a subsequent consecration. John                Paul II writes:                               Everyone in the Church is consecrated in Baptism and Confirmation, but                       the ordained ministry and the consecrated life suppose a different vocation and a                       specific form of consecration, due to a peculiar mission (VC, 31).                       Furthermore:                                Consecrated persons, who embrace the evangelical counsels, receive a                       new and special consecration that, without being sacramental, commits them to                       embrace  -  in  celibacy,  poverty,  and  obedience  -  the  way  of  life  personally                       practiced by Jesus and proposed by Him to the disciples (Ibid.).                       All subsequent consecration is founded on baptism: it is intimately rooted in baptism                and fulfills it more fully (PC 5a).                  15.2. Consecration and holiness                       Although there is close knit connection between consecration and holiness, they are not                the same. Consecration is an intervention of God who makes a person his own, creating a                permanent objective situation. The baptized, the religious, the priest, even in a state of sin,                always remain consecrated. However, in this state, they can be configured as “dry branches”                that, although they remain attached to the tree, are dead. And so, they remain such until the                obstacles that prevent the circulation of the vital sap of grace are not removed.                        However, it is irrational to affirm that a consecrated person, made instrument of the                particular presence and activity of Jesus Christ, does not live a life of holiness, that is, of                intimate communion with God. The ontological sanctity of the consecrated being presupposes                his moral sanctity in an absolute way: You shall be holy to me; for I the LORD am holy, and                have separated you from the peoples, that you should be mine (Lv 20:26).                  15.3. Consecration and mission                        Jesus Christ, in the priestly discourse of the Jewish Last Supper, asks the Father to                consecrate the apostles in truth:                                Sanctify them in the truth; thy word is truth. As thou didst send me into the                       world, so I have sent them into the world.  And for their sake, I consecrate myself,                        that they also may be consecrated in truth (Jn 17:17-19).                       As  it  stands  out  in  the  context,  the  consecration  that  Jesus  asks  the  Father  for  his                disciples is in view of the mission that he would have entrusted to them before he ascended to                heaven: as you sent me to the world.                        John Paul II, in the Apostolic Exhortation VC, strongly emphasizes the relationship                between consecration and mission:                               In the image of Jesus, the beloved Son “whom the Father consecrated and                       sent into the world” (Jn 10:36), those whom God calls to follow him are also                       consecrated and sent into the world to imitate his example and to continue his                                                               51","mission. Fundamentally, this is true of every disciple. In a special way, however,                       it is true of those who, in the manner that characterizes the consecrated life, are                       called to follow Christ “more closely,” and to make him the “all” of their lives.                       The task of devoting themselves wholly to \"mission\" is therefore included in their                       call; indeed, by the action of the Holy Spirit who is at the origin of every vocation                       and charism, consecrated life itself is a mission, as was the whole life of Jesus.                       The profession of the evangelical counsels, which makes a person totally free for                       the service of the Gospel, is important also from this point of view. It can therefore                       be  said  that a  sense  of  mission  is  essential  to  every  Institute,  not  only  those                       dedicated to the active apostolic life but also those dedicated to the contemplative                       life (VC 72).                        In no. 67 of the same document, the Pope suggests to initiate the young aspirants to                religious life in this sense from the first years of their formation: At the same time, from the                moment of initial formation, community life must disclose the essential missionary dimension                of consecration.                The exhortation of the SCRIS (1983) highlights the strict relationship between consecration                and the apostolate:                       By the fact of their consecration, the members are dedicated to God and available to                be sent (EE 12).                         [God] not only chooses, sets apart, and dedicates the person to Himself, but he engages                him in his own divine work. Consecration inevitably implies mission. These are two facets of                one reality (EE 23).                        Religious dedicated to works of the apostolate continue in our time Christ “announcing                God’s Kingdom to the multitude, healing the sick and the maimed” (EE 24, cf. Starting afresh                from Christ, 9).                       It is good to note that it does not say that they prolong the apostolate of Christ, but that                they prolong the presence of Christ, who does the apostolate. The clarification highlights the                existential dimension of the apostle, that is, his “being”, conformed to that of Christ as much                as possible, is also in view making his “acting” effective. Before hearing the word, the people                want to see the apostle who possesses the characteristics that make him credible.                       John Paul II, moreover, sees the apostolate in the founding charism and encourages the                religious to present new answers to the new problems of today’s world […] and translate                courageously into coherent choices, which are consistent with the original charism and with                correspond to the demands of the concrete historical situation […] they work boldly in the                fields determined the founding charism (VC, 73).                       The citations recalled in this paragraph are of great importance, either for the objective                content or for the authoritativeness of the documents from which they are taken. Besides, all,                in some way, are connected in the essential relationship of the consecration-holiness-mission                trinomial, that must characterize the apostle, according to his own charism.                        The content of this chapter, of a general nature, will find concrete applications in the                context of the consecration of the Rogationists, in the section where their specific mission will                be dealt with (cf. no. 31-32 below).                                                                    52","53","16. Jesus sees the crowds and feels compassion for them                          Let us go back to the passage we read in Matthew (9: 35-38).                               And  Jesus  went  about  all  the  cities  and  villages,  teaching  in  their                       synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease                        and  every  infirmity. When  he  saw  the  crowds,  he  had  compassion  for  them,                        because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.  Then he                       said  to  his  disciples, “The harvest is  plentiful,  but  the laborers  are few; pray                       therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” (Mt 9: 35-                       38)                        The  evangelist  places  the  logion  of  our  charism  between  the  narrative  section  of                miracles (chapters 8 and 9) and the apostolic discourse (chapter 10).                       Jesus  went  around...  Jesus,  himself  personally,  and  not  others.  Isaiah  had  also                prophesied it: It was not an angel or a messenger, it was he himself who saved them, rescued                them with his love and mercy, raised them and endured them (Is 63: 9).                       When the time had fully come (Gal 4: 4), Jesus, the apostle of the Father (VC, 9), puts                into action the mission that he had proclaimed in the programmatic speech in the synagogue of                Nazareth (Lk 4: 18-21). He went around - teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the                gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and infirmity - the vast evangelical territory,                where poverty, misery, suffering, physical and moral sickness torment the abandoned crowds                like sheep without a shepherd.                       Jesus taught… Teaching is an essential aspect of the activity of Jesus during his public                life. He teaches in the synagogues (Mt 4:23; Jn 6:59), in the temple (Mt 21:23; Jn 7:14), on the                feasts (Jn 8:20), and also every day (Mt 26: 55). He is the rabbi who teaches with authority (Mt                13: 54).                        His doctrine is not his, but of the one who sent him (Jn 7:16 ff.); he says only what the                Father teaches him (Jn 8, 28). Jesus speaks the words of God (Jn 3:34). He wants to make                known the authentic message of God and lead men to welcome it.                        Jesus  preached…  immediately  after  the  temptations  in  the  desert,  Jesus  began                preaching, announcing the presence of the kingdom, and inviting to conversion: Repent, for the                kingdom of heaven is at hand (Mt 4:17). The theme of the Kingdom of God pervades all the                preaching of Jesus.                       Jesus cured the sick… During his ministry, on the streets he passes, Jesus meets lepers,                lame, blind, possessed, paralytics, oppressed; he expels the unclean spirits and cures diseases                (cf. Mt 8 and 9). Illness is a symbol of sinful man; spiritually, he is blind, deaf, paralyzed, and                thus the healing of the sick represents the spiritual healing that Jesus comes to bring among                men.                        Jesus, the supreme consecrated and missionary of the Father for his Kingdom (VC, 22),                went around the cities and villages. Then, he stopped his itinerant apostolic activity before the                pitiable  crowd,  described  by  Matthew  (9:35-38).  And,  when  he  saw  the  crowds,  he  had                compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.                       It is necessary to understand the profound value of the attitudes and behaviors of Jesus                Christ, which the Rogationist must make his own.                                                                  54","Jesus sees… But his is not an external, superficial look, without any impact on the                consciousness. It goes beyond physical attitude and physiological function. Jesus sees in depth;                his gaze penetrates within the physical or moral suffering. He does not just see suffering faces;                he also sees broken hearts. Jesus sees, perceives, and shares the psychological states of the                afflicted people. He sees and does not pass by. He sees and intervenes. The ten miracles that                precede our evangelical passage, in chapters 8-9 of Matthew, are symbolic.                                                                                        *                       Jesus sees, stops, gets off the horse, and provides (cf. Lk 10:29).  Jesus sees in the                “suffering” a member of his mystical body, of that humanity that he had assumed to redeem.                In the man, he sees his brother, the expression of the love of the Father who created him in his                image and likeness. He sees the man whom he will save at the price of the blood he shed.                        Mercy  and  compassion,  as  divine  attributes,  are  eternal,  as  love  is  eternal.  But  the                manifestation of these sentiments of divine transcendence towards man is inserted into history                from the moment when God seeks Adam the sinner, as we read in the third chapter of Genesis:                                                                                 13                Where are you? It is the first call of Eternal mercy and compassion.                       From this moment, the sacred history is the history of God who seeks man. Mercy,                compassion,  and  forgiveness  resonate  in  the  history  of  humanity,  with  an  ever-increasing                rhythm, until reaching its concrete and ineffable form in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ gets into the                dark web of human vicissitude; he immerses within the fabric of history, and concretely covers                the entire arc of his apostolic life with the compassionate love of the heavenly Father. For this,                he was consecrated with the anointing and sent.                        In Jesus, the loving kindness of God appeared (cf. Lk 1:78; Tt 3:4-7). Jesus Christ,                supreme sign, the absolute revelation of the Father's charity, perfectly reveals the beating of                his  heart  for  the  entire  world  submerged  in  sin.  The  heart  of  God  is  no  longer  an                anthropomorphism but a real heart of flesh.                       God  planned  in  the  fullness  of  time  to  restore  all  things  in  Christ  (Ant.  Vespers,                Monday, Week II, O.T.). The world has a heart:                       •  the heart of the physical body of Christ, formed in the pure womb of Mary;                        •  the Eucharistic heart of Christ, on the altars and in tabernacles;                        •  the heart of the mystical Body of Christ, in the Church;                       •  the compassionate heart of Christ in the Rogate.                        But what com-passion? Cardinal Ratzinger, in the quoted homily (cf. above, in 13),                referring  to  the  scene  of  the  Rogate  in  Matthew,  with  profound  psychology  reads  the                compassion in Christ and describes it thus:                                At  this  point,  a  word  appears  in  the  Gospel  like  lightning,  hardly                       translatable  from  the  Greek,  esplagkniste,  which  we  translate  with                       “sympathized.” But the word expresses a more radical participation. It includes                       the  root  of  the  word:  “bowels”  and  refers  to  the  maternal  womb,  to  the                       identification of the mother with her child, to the sharing of two lives that become                       one. Thus, Jesus, touched by the suffering of the crowd, by this “darkness”, feels                  *  EN: A reference to the Parable of the Good Samaritan. The Author identifies Jesus with the Good Samaritan.                13  I thank the Lord our God, who created such a wonderful work in which to find his rest. He created heaven, and                I do not read that he rested; He created the earth, and I do not read that he rested; He created the sun, the moon,                the stars and I do not read that neither he rested. On the other hand, I read that he created man and at this point                he rested, having someone to whom he could forgive sins (fecerit hominem et tunc requieverit, habens cui peccata                dimitteret) (cf. AMBROSIO, Hexamerón VI, 76).                                                              55","compassion  that  becomes  identification.  He  carries  with  him  the  pains  of                       humanity, which become his pains.                       The abandoned crowds, like sheep without a shepherd, before whom the Christ of the                Rogate  trembles  with  compassion  (cf.  Mt  9:36),  are  not  only  those  gathered  within  the                perimeter of the Gospel scene of Matthew but all the afflicted, the sick, the marginalized, the                desperate, who populate the pages of the Gospel.                        Matthew’s  scene  is  only  the  symbolic  vision  of  a  situation  that  reaches  universal                horizons of time and space.                       It is always the Christ of the Rogate who sees, feels compassion, and intervenes:                        •  in front of the hungry crowds (cf. Mk 6:34);                       •   before the blind men of Jericho who begged him (cf. Mt 20:34);                        •  before the widow of Nain (cf. Lk 7:13);                        •  in front of the leper, he touches and heals (cf. Mk 1:41).                       It is always the Christ of the Rogate who:                       •  is deeply moved, begins to cry in front of the grave of Lazarus (cf. Jn 15: 7-10);                        •  goes in search of the lost sheep and coin (Lk 15: 7-10);                        •  identifies with the father of the prodigal son (Lk 15:20).                       The  Christ  of  the  Rogate  is  a  compassionate  icon  of  the  heavenly  Father.  If  the                characteristic trait of the Christ of the Rogate is compassion, with reference to our charism, we                have to conclude that we find the Christ of the Rogate everywhere and always in the Gospel,                because everywhere and always, the pages of the Gospel are imbued with the compassion of                Jesus Christ.                        The  infinite  compassion  of  the  heavenly  Father  finds  its  concretization  in  the                compassionate heart of Christ of the Rogate. The sacrifice of Jesus Christ merges with that of                the Father, who has sacrificed his beloved Son (Col 1:13) for us. Creation, Incarnation, and                Redemption complete the arc of divine agape, in the sign of the compassionate love of the                Good Shepherd who gives his life for his sheep (cf. Jn 10:15).                        Father Hannibal affirms: Let us look at Jesus in his passion; here, love puts him under                a wine press, squeezes him, transforms him into a “man of sorrows”. Jesus crucified is the                most convincing argument of God's love for man (AR, p. 785).                        They shall look on him whom they have pierced (Jn 19:37). The pierced heart of Jesus                Christ on the cross is the compassionate heart of the Christ of the Rogate who, before giving                his spirit into the hands of the Father, said: It is finished (Jn 19:30); that is, I have already                revealed to the world and brought love and compassion to its fullest, according to the project                you entrusted to me.                       The compassionate love of the Christ of the Rogate did not diminish with his ascension                to the right hand of the Father, but it surpasses the passing of the generations because it is an                irrevocable project.                       The counsel of the Lord stands forever; the thoughts of his heart to all generations (Ps                33:11).  Mary,  in  Elizabeth's  house,  also  sings:  his  mercy  is  on  those  who  fear  him  from                generation to generation (Lk 1:50).                                                                 56","The apostles and their successors whom we will ask from the Lord of the harvest will                be ministers of divine compassion in the exercise of the ministry.                                                                                                                                                  57","17. Compassion is the primary element                                              and soul of the Rogate                         The statement that we proclaim in the preface of the Mass in honor of our holy Founder                is marvelously true and exalting: You made Saint Hannibal Mary worthy minister of your Son's                compassion to the crowds, conforming him to his image of Good Shepherd. God made Hannibal                a worthy minister of compassion. Compassion is a gift, a charism of the Spirit. God, in the                Spirit,  shared  with  Saint  Hannibal  the  compassion  of  his  Son  towards  the  exhausted  and                abandoned crowds.                          This consideration of the spiritual features of our Founder is fundamental from the                charismatic point of view. It is confirmed by Cardinal Ratzinger himself, who testifies that in                Father Hannibal, the process of identification with the needy brother was “identical” to that of                Jesus Christ: The context of the life of our Blessed is surprisingly identical with this context of                the word and action of Jesus. Christ commands the Rogate because he has compassion. Father                Hannibal obeys the Rogate because he has compassion.                          Compassion  is  the  reason  for  the  Rogate-command,  as  well  as  the  reason  for                obedience to the Rogate-command. The Rogationist is called to put himself on the side and in                the school of Jesus. He must have the capacity to immerse himself into the innermost being of                the needy brother, assume the difficult situations, pains, needs and, possibly, share the dramatic                conditions of the communities where he is destined, according to the example and experience                of Father Hannibal in the Avignone Quarter, to free him from the states of slavery that oppress                him. Compassion for the Rogationist cannot be a pure sentiment, but a true co-participation                (cf. above, in 31.7). Therefore, in praying for vocations, before asking for laborers for the                harvest, we must ask the Lord of the harvest for compassionate hearts: compassion, in the name                and for the love of Jesus Christ, is the energy that gives strength to the laborers.                                                                                                     58","18. The plentiful harvest is in danger of being lost                         Then he says to his disciples: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; pray                therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” (Mt 9:37b-38).                       The Lord of the harvest is God. In the traditional prayer inspired and written in 1880,                printed in the typography of the Avignone Quarter in 1885, Father Hannibal addresses the Lord                with these words:                               Now, You are the Lord of the harvest; You are the mystical Gardener who                       planted the vineyard of souls and watered it with your Precious Blood, You formed                       your Church like a flourishing field, like an enclosed garden, in which You like to                       gather the flowers of holy virtues and the fruits of good works!                  18.1. The harvest and its conditions                        The crop and the corresponding harvesting in the New Testament have a figurative,                symbolic meaning, referring to the final judgment. In our context, the harvest constitutes the                abandoned crowds, the sheep without a shepherd. It represents the entire humanity that inhabits                the earth on pilgrimage to the heavenly homeland, for which they were created. Therefore, also                in our case, the harvest has an eschatological value, though not universal, but personal.                       In fact, at the moment of death, man will reach the ultimate goal of his eternal happiness                with the condition that he has realized himself according to the fundamental vocation, that of                the son of God - which is communicated to him by the grace of the sacraments - and has fully                realized his personal historical vocation.                        In the writings of our Founder, they are always recurring, either directly or indirectly:                       •  the miserable state of the harvest;                        •  the immeasurable disproportion between the abundance of the ripe harvest and the                           laborers who would have to gather it;                       •  the extreme urgency of the harvest to avoid its danger of being lost.                        The biblical scholar Settimio Cipriani, who deepened our evangelical passages in his                various studies and articles, when commenting on Matthew (9:38), affirms:                                The “harvest” here obviously refers to the ripening phase, laden with joy                       and promise, as of a field of wheat waving in the wind. But precisely where the                       hope was born, there also arises the anguish concern for the owner: the entire                       harvest could be lost, if the “harvesters” are not hired in time. The shortage of                       laborers could make everything fail, thus wasting the precious and prolonged                       work (S. Cipriani, The Rogate in its biblical foundations, in “Studi Rogazionisti”                       17, p. 21-40).                        The dramatic horizon of the old and new poverty extends before the eyes of Jesus. He                sees all the poor in human history, those who lack something essential for their existence and                subsistence:  health,  food,  home,  dignity,  work,  freedom,  homeland,  etc.  John  Paul  II  also                includes the little ones in the list of the poor (cf. VC, 82). Jesus sees the poorest of the poor,                the sinners who lack the highest good, the grace of God. Cardinal Ratzinger thus interprets the                gaze of Jesus before the crowds:                                                               59","And Jesus, with the eyes of the infinite, sees not only this small piece of                       land, but he sees all of human history: past, present, and future. […] Indeed, he                       sees so much pain of men; he sees this shadow of death.                        Aware of the dramatic situation that transcends spaces and times and reaches the limits                of eternity, Father Hannibal highlights, with the repetition of the all-embracing adjective, the                abundance of the harvest and the scarcity of laborers:                                Jesus, moved by compassion, exclaimed: The harvest is abundant, but the                       laborers are few, therefore, ask the Lord of the harvest to send laborers to his                       harvest. When our Lord Jesus Christ spoke thus, he had in mind all the centuries,                       all the cities, all the peoples, all the regions of the world until the end of the                       centuries. He lamented in his heart the scarcity of evangelical laborers of the Holy                       Church, more or less severe in some other times (Una grande parola, p. 3).                       In the scene described by Matthew, Saint Hannibal sees the most sensitive Heart of                Jesus afflicted at the sight of the anger, the resentment, the hatred, the rage, the thefts, the                blasphemies, and all the cruelties of men that he embraced in a single glance.                       And he directs his attention further to the sector of the harvest that most affects and                worries him, the one formed by young men and women who perish due to lack of evangelical                laborers, who would evangelize and bring salvation through their ministry:                                Alas! How many young people, in the prime of years, take the miserable                      path, because in the suitable time the good evangelical laborers were lacking, who                      would gather and bring them to godliness with Pious Unions, with Associations,                      with good readings, with holy industries, and with true zeal? The wavering honesty                      of many plebeian and civilized girls perishes, because there are no Ministers of the                      Lord who, tireless in preaching, in the confessional, in education, would lead young                      women to frequent the Sacraments (Scritti, vol. 51, p. 126).                        The ripe and abundant harvest is the cause of the anguished concern of the Lord of the                harvest,  in  the  perspective  that  after  his  many  efforts  he  cannot  gather  and  store  it  in  the                granaries, because the laborers are few:                              The  number  of  laborers  in  the  vineyard  has  become  scarce;  the  good                      laborers in the Church are lacking; the light of the world has eclipsed. Hence the                      peoples remain in the darkness of ignorance and sin; hence Satan devours the prey,                      the little ones ask for the bread of life, and there is no one to break it for them                      (Prayer to the Heart of Jesus to obtain good laborers for the Holy Church).                                                                                      60","*                                 19. The Rogate and the intimate sorrows                         Before discussing the relationship between the Rogate and intimate sorrows, it is useful                to learn from our Founder the nature and dimensions of the sorrows and pains suffered by Our                Lord Jesus Christ.                       Father Hannibal not only identified himself with the compassion that Jesus feels for the                flock  without  a  shepherd,  but  he  enters  into  the  compassionate  heart  of  Christ,  almost  to                analyze, deepen. and share the sorrows that torment the Heart of God made man.                       In the preface to the work of the venerable Thomas of Jesus, Torments of Our Lord                Jesus Christ, Father Hannibal sees the sufferings of Jesus in a triple perspective:                                The adorable Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ has three perspectives: the                       first is formed by the bitter sufferings of the holiest humanity of Jesus Christ; the                       second for the unspeakable offenses and disgraces to which he wanted to submit                       himself for love of us; the third for the inconsolable sorrows of his soul and his                       divine Heart (Scritti, vol. 60, n. 850).                       First, there are the bodily pains to which he willingly submitted himself, in the terrible                passion, to pay the debt incurred by all sinful men, from Adam to the last one who will live till                the end of history. We read in Is 53: He has borne our griefs; he has carried our sorrows […]                The Lord has laid the iniquities of us all.                        In the divine person of Jesus Christ, we must see the pain in relation to love. Jesus                suffers because he loves. Since the love with which he loves his creatures is infinite, even the                pains of the scourging, the crowning of thorns, the crucifixion, the torments, and spasms on the                cross reach dimensions that we cannot understand. We can imagine the sum of the physical                pains mysteriously concentrated and compressed in the heart of the Savior, with very high                                                                                             14                density and cohesion similar to that which exists within some heavenly bodies.  The state of                extreme pain of the Man-God resounds in the lacerating prayer addressed to the Father in                Gethsemane, given the atrocious sufferings that await him: My Father, if it be possible, let this                chalice pass from me (Mt 26:39).                       The second category of the pains considered by Father Hannibal is of a mental type.                They  are  the  pains  caused  by  indifference,  insensibility,  insults,  inexpressible  reproaches,                ingratitude, above all, of those who received the greatest gifts from the Lord, such as religious                and  priests.  The  first  lament  of  Jesus  resounds  precisely  in  the  arden  of  Olives  when  he                addresses those disciples whom he wanted closer to him than others: Sic non potuistis una ora                vigilare mecum? Could you not keep watch with me for one hour? (Mt 26: 40).                        Father Hannibal defines the third class of pains as intimate sorrows, which exceed the                                                                                      **                physical and the mental. We could describe them “theandrical pains”,  because they were                suffered by Jesus, in his specific identity as Man-God, the only savior of humankind. It is the                particularly devastating sorrows that are procured for him by those who reject salvation in a                decisively obstinate way and frustrate the Savior’s love shown by giving his Body and shedding                his Blood.                    *  EN: St. Hannibal Mary used the term pene intime which is translated literally into English as intimate pains.                This English edition translates it as intimate sorrows.                                            3                14  Neutron stars, black holes. A cm  of these stars weighs several tons on the earth.                **  EN: Theandric refers to the union of the divine and the human natures in Jesus Christ.                                                              61","The bitter waters that flooded the holiest soul of Jesus Christ pour forth                       from  various  sources.  The  primary  ones  would  be,  as  Jesus  Christ  himself                       revealed to Blessed Villani: the sight of all the sins that he carried on himself and                       for  which  he  took  responsibility  before  the  justice  of  his  Father;  the  human                       ingratitude, before his love and his sufferings, for which he made the prophet                       David to say: “Quæ utilitas in sanguine meo?” What profit is there in my blood?                       (Ps 29:10). The sight of the loss of souls, which made him exclaim through the                       mouth of the prophet: “Dolores inferni circumdederunt me!” The sorrows of hell                       encompassed me (Ps 17:5) (Regulation for the Daughters of Divine Zeal of the                       Heart of Jesus, December 15, 1920).                       The Founder became so much absorbed and assimilated with the intimate sorrows of                Jesus, that he cannot find the terms that can express it in the right measure; to express them, he                resorts to the most relevant and significant expressions of intimate suffering and most acute                pain, which we read in the Bible: the two verses, one of Psalm 29: Quæ utilitas in sanguine                meo?  What  profit  is  there  in  my  blood?  and  the  other  of  Psalm  17:  Dolores  inferni                circumdederunt me! The sorrows of hell encompassed me! The sorrows of Jesus are so great                that he feels assailed and overwhelmed by the impetuous waves of an overflowing torrent,                which drags him into the darkness of death.                        The Founder takes another analogy from Psalm 51:5: Factum est cor meum tamquam                ceram liquescens in medio ventris mei. My heart has become like wax melting in the midst of                my bowels (Ps 21:15); Scritti, vol. 12, n. 1932).                        The intimate sorrows of Jesus  Savior are so  atrocious  and violent  that they almost                destroy the cohesion of the heart, which melts like wax and loses its form and its vital function.                The  phenomenon  refers  to  the  divine  dignity  that  is  trampled  by  sin.  To  express  the                impossibility of understanding the intimate sorrows of Jesus Christ, Father Hannibal links the                love of God with the loss of souls:                                Let us measure, if possible, these two extremes: the love of Jesus for souls                       and the eternal loss of souls. The love of Jesus cannot be measured because it is                       infinite; the loss of souls cannot be appraised, because eternity is a kind of infinity                       in time that we cannot comprehend. The pain, therefore, that results from it, is                       infinite pain (Scritti, vol. 12, p. 85-86).                  19.1. The intimate sorrows are a constitutive element of the Rogationist spirituality                       Father Hannibal is deeply convinced that there is a very close relationship between the                Rogate and the intimate sorrows. Because of this original intuition of his, the intimate sorrows                of the Heart of Jesus were the constant object of his meditations, reflections, sermons, and                teachings. The meditation on the intimate sorrows is a constitutive element of the specific                spirituality of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal and enters into our regulations,                precisely because of its close connection with the Rogate. Our Founder repeats it several times:                             The particular spirit of this institute that is formed on that word of Our Lord                      Jesus  Christ:  ‘Rogate  ergo  etc….’  is  closely  linked  with  this  meditation on  the                      intimate sorrows of the Heart of Jesus, because the soul that pierces through these                      sorrows cannot remain indifferent to the interests of that divine Heart. It vividly                      feels them and shares them and would also like to sacrifice itself for those divine                      interests. Then, that divine word that came from that divine Heart: “Rogate… etc.’                      will resonate in our ear, and in obedience to this command, the soul finds a great                      means to console the Most Holy Heart of Jesus in his sorrows. This prayer looks                                                               62","directly at the greater glory of God and sanctification of the souls and includes all                      the interests of the Most Holy Heart of Jesus (Scritti, vol. 61, p. 154).                       The reason is obvious. The intimate sorrows are caused by souls who are lost due to a                lack of good laborers. With obedience to the command of Jesus, the Lord of the harvest sends                collaborators of Christ in the work of salvation, and the cause of his intimate sorrows are                eliminated. Therefore, the Rogate is configured as an unsurpassable dike that blocks the most                bitter waters from flooding the Heart of Christ.                        Father  Hannibal  is  convinced  that  the  Rogationist  who  becomes  aware  of  his  own                identity, according to the profile outlined by the rules, cannot avoid feeling shipwrecked and                drowned in the sea of these ineffable sorrows. He affirms it in Declarations and Promises,                XXIII [and XXI]:                            […]  In  conformity  with  the  Rules  of  this  Pious  Congregation  of  the                       Rogationists  of  the  Heart of  Jesus, I  will  give  myself to  the  meditation  of the                       intimate sorrows of the Heart of Jesus. This means to say that I will consider and                       reflect on the profound and hidden torments of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus,                       from the first instant of his Incarnation, at the sight of universal sins, at the sight                       of human ingratitude, at the sight of the harm in the souls of the elect themselves,                       and especially at the sight of the eternal loss of so many souls! I will submerge                       myself in this immeasurable abyss of  the  sorrows of  the  Most  Sacred  Heart of                       Jesus, which surpass by far those of His most Holy Humanity and which very few                       people consider. I will unite myself to these sorrows of the Divine Redeemer to feel                       them in my heart; I will contemplate Him lost and submerged in the ocean of these                       unspeakable pains in the Garden of Olives.                                I will feel my heart pierced by so much  harm  affecting  particularly the                       tender harvest, which is the emerging generations. I will immerse myself in the                       intimate sorrows of  the  Most  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus  for such  continuous and                       secular misery (Declarations and Promises, XXI).                               The faithful Daughters and lovers of the Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus                       should never neglect the meditation on the intimate sorrows of this Divine Heart,                       which they usually do in the afternoon with appropriate considerations. Each soul                       will enter into them, will pity the loving Heart of Jesus that suffers so much, and                       zeal and fervor will ignite so as to console him as much as possible not only with                       her sanctification but if possible with the sanctification and salvation of all souls.                       Zeal will ignite to implore the Most Holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary for armies of                       Ministers chosen for the Shrine, Apostles of Faith and Charity, holy and chosen                       souls in all social classes, so that the Kingdom of God may be extended on earth                       over the ruins of the kingdom of sin. All this, so that the Adorable Heart of Jesus                       is  relieved of  his  intimate sorrows  and infinitely consoled  (Regulation  for  the                       Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus, December 15, 1920).                                If we look at our miserable times, we cannot avoid sharing in the sorrows                       of the Adorable Heart of Jesus, seeing how much scarcity of laborers there is in                       the mystical harvest (Scritti, vol. 50, p. 103).                                (…) in obedience to this command, we find a great means to console the                       Most Holy Heart of Jesus in his sorrows (Scritti, vol. 61, p. 154).                        Obedience to the Rogate is the supreme means of consolation of that Heart, who always                had compassion for all, but in the end, did not receive compassion from anyone: I looked for                pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none (Ps 69: 21 [20]).                                                               63","The Founder is sensitive to the request for consolation that the Heart of Jesus addresses                to Saint Margaret Alacoque:                               See the Heart that loved so much humankind, (...) but in return receives                       nothing but ingratitude and insults. (...) At least you, give me this consolation, to                       make up as much as you can, for their ingratitude. (…) The Father had no other                       desire in his life than to do everything ad maiorem, ad maximam, ad infinitam                       consolationem  Cordis  Iesu!  [for  the  greater,  for  the  greatest,  for  the  infinite                       consolation of the Heart of Jesus] (AP, p. 254).                       Let us close this paragraph with the following affirmation of Father Hannibal: your                loving Heart groans and sighs for the loss of souls but then rejoices and exults when souls are                edified, sanctified, and led to eternal life through good laborers (Prayer for good laborers, in                Scritti, vol. 6, n. 4488).                       Sublime and tremendous is the function and purpose of the Rogate! The Spirit has                entrusted to the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal a mission that transcends all                other possible missions: to make the Heart of Jesus rejoice and exult, but also tremendous is                the thought of unfaithfulness to the Christ of the Rogate.                  19.2. The intimate sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary                        Jesus  suffers  from  insults,  ingratitude,  loss  of  souls.  Father  Hannibal  affirms  that                another reason for the sufferings of Christ is the pains suffered by his Most Holy Mother:                                …the sight of the sorrows of his Most Holy Mother, who was the only one                       capable of penetrating the deep abyss of the intimate sorrows of the Heart of Jesus                       and who had to become the Queen of Martyrs (Scritti, vol. 44, p. 70 ).                        Elsewhere, he integrates this insight through the declaration, promise, and commitment                that his disciples must make:                                To this meditation on the intimate sorrows of  the Most Sacred Heart of                       Jesus, I will always associate the meditation of the interior sorrows of the Most                       Holy Virgin Mary, who alone fathomed, understood, and shared all the pains and                       mental sufferings of our Lord Jesus Christ (Declarations and Promises, XXIII).                        Jesus suffers for the pains of his Mother. Mary suffers for the pains of her Son. The                mutual penetration in the deep strata of the soul and the generous participation of their passion                are due because only Jesus can understand the deep abyss of the intimate sorrows of his Mother,                and only Mary can understand the deep abyss of the intimate sorrows of her Son. Within Jesus,                the image of the Sorrowful Mother is reproduced; and within Mary, the image of Jesus, the                suffering servant, is replicated as well. The image is explained in such a total and profound                way,  such  as  to  create  almost  a  second  reciprocal  presence  within  the  two  persons,  who,                nonetheless    remain  distinct,  since  the  phenomenon  occurs  not  in  the  physical,  but  in  the                spiritual and mental way.                        We are denied the full comprehension, not only of the pains of Jesus but also of His                Most Holy Mother. Some brief reflections. We cannot have the exact grasp of her being the                Immaculate Conception because it is an experience lived by Adam and Eve before sin. In the                same  way,  we  cannot  understand  the  abyss  of  those  pains  that  are  the  reason  for  her                glorification side by side the Word incarnated in her purest womb.                       Mary, more than Saint Paul, can say: he loved me and gave himself for me (Gal 2:20).                The Blessed Virgin knows well that Jesus suffered passion and death for her first, even before                                                               64","men and angels. Indeed, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Savior of the human race,                                                                    *                she was preserved free from all stain of original sin.  Therefore, it is evident that more than                men and angels, the Virgin participates in the passion and intimate sorrows of Jesus.                       Propter quod [because of this] (Phil 2:9). In Christ, the glorification and exaltation of                his humanity, today at the right hand of the Father, responds to the atrocious torture and the                extreme humiliation of death on a cross. It was the energy developed by the “grain of wheat”,                decayed in the deepest layers of the existential condition of a living being, that propelled the                humanity of the Word of God into the sphere of divine transcendence.                       In a parallel way, the elevation and glorification of Mary above the angels and saints,                crowned queen of the universe at the right of the Son, finds its reason in the fact that on earth                she  was  the  grain  of  wheat  which,  next  to  her  Jesus,  reached  the  mysterious  depths                incomprehensible to us.                       In LG we read that Mary suffered  exceedingly with her  only begotten Son, uniting                herself with a maternal heart with His sacrifice, and lovingly consenting to the immolation of                this Victim which she herself had brought forth (no. 58).                       Mary most holy is Mother. Like and above than all mothers, she is sensitive to her Son’s                pains and would make every effort, if it were possible, to make his sufferings her own. Since                this transfer is not possible at a physical level, it happens at a mental level. The pains of the                Son spill into the heart of the Mother with the violence of an enormous waterfall. To get a pale                idea  of  the  unspeakable  sufferings  of  Christ  present  in  Mary,  we  can  refer  to  the  psychic                phenomenon of somatization. When Mary sees the face of her Son crowned with thorns, or the                nails that pierce through his hands and feet, she feels in a bloodless way those thorns and nails,                piercing through her body, with a pain undoubtedly inferior to that  which Jesus suffered, but                equally  so  strong  that  neither  the  martyrs  nor  the  saints  who  had  the  gift  of  stigmata  can                imagine.                       Another useful analogy is the phenomenon of acoustic resonance. When we vibrate the                string of a guitar and put it at the right distance next to another guitar with a string identical to                the one that vibrates, this second string hit by the sound wave, without anyone touching it,                vibrates with the same intensity and produces the same sound as the first one. On a spiritual                level, the same phenomenon occurs between the body of Christ and that of Mary, so similar to                that of her Son: caro Christi, caro Mariæ [body of Christ, body of Mary].                       Furthermore, Jesus shares to his Mother not only the physical pains of his body but also                the intimate sorrows that he suffers as Man-God, for the loss of souls that reject salvation.                Paraphrasing Saint Paul, Mary could affirm, it is no longer I who live, but it is the crucified                Christ who lives in me (Gal 2:20). The one who in Nazareth had welcomed in her womb the                Word-made-man, under  the cross, receives the  Word-made-pain.  The  gratia plena [full  of                grace] is also the doloribus plena [full of sorrows]. This grace is not only the fullness of                sanctifying grace. It is also the fullness of suffering for Christ: For it has been granted to that                for the sake of Christ, you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake (Phil 1:29).                        Christian piety and art present the heart of Mary pierced by seven swords. Simeon’s                prophecy goes even further: that sword pierces not into the heart, but the soul, with an evident                allusion to the exaltation of pain, which invades the noble part of Mary’s life: her soul. Let us                conclude with the exhortation that our holy Founder, Father Hannibal, addresses to his spiritual                children:                     EN:  Apostolic constitution Ineffabilis Deus of Pope Pius IX in 1854, which solemnly affirmed the dogma of the                *                Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.                                                              65","While we are in this valley of tears, we must cry with Jesus and Mary: our                       occupation must be to contemplate the sorrows of Jesus and Mary. Our devotion                       to the Blessed Virgin, under any title, must always refer to her title as Sorrowful.                       In any holy image of Mary Most Holy, we must see her Sorrowful and suffering!                       (Sermon on the Sorrowful Mother, Messina, September 28, 1913, in Scritti, vol.                       21, n. 4796).                                                                                                                                          66","20. The Rogate, the mystery of collaboration                                  Then he said to his disciples: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers                       are  few;  pray  therefore  the  Lord  of  the  harvest  to  send  out  laborers  into  his                       harvest” (Mt 9: 37-38).                               After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two others, and sent them on ahead                       of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to come.                       And he said to them: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore,                       pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” (Lk                       10:1-2).                        God wanted to realize the plan of salvation through the incarnation of the Word: the                hypostatic union. In other words, human nature, assumed by and in the divine person, while on                the one hand is redeemed and sanctified, on the other hand, it offers itself to collaborate in the                mission of the Word totally and perfectly, as it is involved fully and definitively. In other words,                it is human nature that allows the Word to actualize, in the current economy of salvation, the                redemption of the world.                        Jesus, in fact, feels and cries like every man; he goes in search of the lost sheep with                the feet of a man, works with the hands of a man, expresses the merciful love of the Father with                a human heart. He carries out the mission that the Father entrusted to him until death on a cross                because he is truly human.                        However, in addition to the human nature assumed in the divine person, Jesus Christ,                Man-God, the one “consecrated with the anointing and sent” to fulfill the universal saving will                of the Father, in front of the infinite amount of the harvest ready to be gathered, needs other                men as collaborators. He asks for them and obtains them from the heavenly Father, the Lord                of the harvest (cf. Lk 6:12-13).                       Analogous to the mystery of the hypostatic union, Jesus Christ, in entrusting his powers                and his mission to the apostles and their successors, wanted to realize what we could define as                the  “hypostatic  association”.  With  this,  Christ  does  not  unite  the  disciples  to  himself                ontologically, but simply associates them with his person, who always remains the principal,                rather unique agent. To carry out his plans, the Lord uses typically secondary causes, that is,                his own creatures.                       The Vatican II, in no. 5 of the PO, thus says:                                God, who alone is holy and who alone bestows holiness, willed to take as                       his companions and helper men who would humbly dedicate themselves to the                       work of sanctification. Hence, through the ministry of the bishop, God consecrates                       priests, that being made sharers by special title in the priesthood of Christ, they                       might  act  as his ministers  in  performing sacred functions. In the liturgy, they                       continue to carry on his priestly office by the action of his Spirit.                        Therefore, we could affirm that, although at a different level, both formulas - hypostatic                union  and  hypostatic  association  -  are  necessary,  obviously  not  of  absolute  but  a  relative                necessity. God could have saved all men with a simple fiat.                        The two evangelists insert our logion in a missionary context. In Matthew, it precedes                the  apostolic  discourse,  where  Jesus  calls  the  Twelve,  entrusted  them  the  message,  and                instructed them regarding the mission that they have to carry out. Luke places the logion after                underlining the demands of the apostolic vocation, and at the time, he sends seventy-two (or                                                               67","seventy) disciples.                        Since the beginning of his public life, Jesus calls Peter, Andrew, James, and John to                follow him (cf. Mt 4:18-22), then he appointed twelve to be with him and to be sent out to                preach (Mk 3:14-15); He sends them into the world as the Father sent him (cf. Jn 20:21); like                him, they have to preach that the kingdom of God is near, heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse                the lepers, cast out demons (cf. Mt 10:7-8); he confers on them his authority (cf. Mt 10:40);                they are his  ambassadors  as if God himself was exhorting  through them (cf. 2 Cor 5:20).                Finally, he gives himself as the object of preaching (cf. 1 Cor 1:23-25; 2:1-3).                       Jesus wanted to delegate his apostolic mission to men who were “his other self”.                        The purpose and objective of the Evangelical Rogation is precisely to ask the Lord of                the harvest for the collaborators of Jesus Christ in the history of salvation (cf. below, in 22).                They will be his collaborators and the depositaries of all the powers of salvation, the first rings                of a chain that will be extended throughout the course of history (S. CIPRIANI, Parola di Dio,                p. 70).                                                                                                                          68","21. The fourth vow of the Rogationists                                       and the Daughters of Divine Zeal                         According to the understanding of the Founder, all believers are bound to obey the                Rogate, although, in the first instance, Jesus Christ directed it to his disciples. However, the                Rogationists  and  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  by  virtue  of  the  specific  vocation  and                consecration,  chosen  and  sent  for  a  precise  mission,  sum  up  their  existence  in  absolute                obedience to the Lord’s command. The Rogationist religious lives the specific charism of the                Institute insofar as he observes the corresponding vow, as it is recorded in the Constitutions                approved by the Church. It is useful, therefore, before examining the commitments deriving                from the fourth vow, to refer to the nature of the constitutions and the religious vow.                        We have reiterated several times that the charism is a spiritual and invisible gift, and it                becomes  visible  in  the  elements  that  make  up  the  spiritual  and  operative  features  of  the                religious, who concretizes it and inserts it into the field of the communion of the Church and                in the structures of the Institute. Therefore, to live it within a community, the charism must be                given  a  juridical  status,  expressed  in  the  constitutions  approved  by  the  Church.  The                constitutions establish and stabilize the way of living the vows, the essential outlines of the                proper  spirituality  and  mission,  the  fundamental  norms  that  regulate  the  personal  and                community  life  of  consecrated  persons.  It  is  useful  to  point  out  that,  before  being  a  legal                instrument,  the constitutions  reflect  the evangelical  and charismatic ideal.  Indeed, to  write                them, the founders are assisted by the Holy Spirit. The institutionalization of a charism through                the constitutions approved by the Church is a charismatic event.                       The vow is the deliberate and free promise made to God of a possible and higher good                (CJC  1191,1).  It  can  be  “real”  if  it  consists  of  offering  something  or  service  to  God,  or                “personal”  when  the  person  dedicates  himself  and  offers  himself  to  God  totally  and                unconditionally. When the religious makes the vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience, he                does not offer God a thing, but the fundamental dynamism of his being, that is, he makes a                holocaust of his existence. The personal vow is placed in the order of being (cf. EE 14), based                on the specific charism.                       Not all religious Institutes have a fourth vow that refers to the charism itself. Father                Hannibal fully understood the fundamental importance of the Rogate for the coming of the                kingdom and, with wise determination, raised it to the level of a vow that, throughout the years,                since the first constitutions of 1926 that bear the Founder's seal, up to the Constitutions of 1998,                                                                            15                always kept the triple dimension: pray-zeal-be good laborers.                 15  Becoming a priest, he had an idea, that could be something very much acceptable to the Most Holy Heart of                Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin, and filled with great benefits, if two Religious Communities                were formed, one of men and one of women, who have the vow of obedience to that command of Jesus Christ:                Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam, and by means of this vow they would bind                themselves to three things:                   1. To pray every day and fervently the adorable Heart of Jesus, the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint Joseph the                Angels and the Saints, to implore  numerous and holy priests and holy laborers for the Holy Church, for all                peoples, for all nations of the world, and most holy and extraordinary vocations for all seminaries, for all religious                orders and for all dioceses […]                   2. To spread everywhere, as far as possible, this spirit of prayer in homage and obedience to that divine                command.                   3. To live, both male and female communities, according to their limits and possibilities, as laborers of the                mystical harvest, working for the spiritual and temporal good of their neighbors (cf. Invitation and Regulation of                the  private  Pious  Constitution  of  spiritual  Cofounders  and  Co-foundresses  of  the  pious  institution  of  the                Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus and the Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart, Oria, November 8, 1910, in                                                              69","Given this, let us make a brief analysis of our fourth vow, according to the formula                                                                                                   *                proposed to us in the draft of the Constitutions prepared for the 2010 Chapter (no. 49).                               To fulfill this vow, we commit ourselves to direct and offer to the Lord of                       the  harvest  our  lives  and  all  the  works  that  form  the  spiritual  and  apostolic                       heritage of the Institute:                               § 1 – praying daily to obtain the “good laborers of the Kingdom of God”                       (prayer-contemplative dimension);                               § 2 – propagating everywhere this spirit of prayer and promoting vocations                       (diffusion-vocational dimension);                                § 3 – being good laborers in the Church by committing ourselves in the                       works of charity, in the education and sanctification of children and young people,                       especially the poor and abandoned, in evangelization, human promotion, and the                       help of the poor (active-charitable dimension).                  21.1. To pray                       It must be said that all three areas (pray-propagate-being good workers) are essential.                They  have  the  same  binding  force  and  are  integrated  into  an  unum  and,  according  to  the                Founder, they constitute the mission of the Rogationists (cf. AR, p. 672; Rules of the Pious                Congregation of the Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus, Rome, November 9, 1914, in Scritti,                vol. 3, n. 1575).                        However, only the first two dimensions define, characterize, specify, and identify us as                                                                                       16                Rogationists and Daughters of Divine Zeal. The third,  no, it does not.   The apostolate of                charity is an essential constituent element, but it is not an element of identification. Indeed, it                is the common denominator of many other religious Institutes.                       Only the Rogationists, at the institutional level, have the duty, under the charismatic                proprium, to live and spread the Evangelical Prayer. The Founder affirms it and repeats it                several times:                               … a Pious Work, which is perhaps the only one consecrated to that divine                       Rogation which today, we have to confess, are unleashed from the pages of the                       two Evangelists, to reverberate in the heart of the Church, to resound like thunder                       in the ear of all Catholic cities, of all true believers and lovers of Jesus Christ, as                       the true and most appropriate means needed by the growing desolation of the Holy                       Place! (PPA 1919).                       The letter that the Father Founder writes to Father Jordan (cf. MB III, pp. 481 ff.) is a                document which irrefutably shows that the apostolate of charity is not an identifying character.                After  failing  in  several  attempts  of  forming  a  group  of  clerics,  Father  Hannibal,  begs  the                founder of the Salvatorians to assume his religious Institutes. Therefore, the letter configures                as a true testament that contains the inventory of an inheritance that he is leaving to others. In                this document, then, we read the two areas of the fourth vow: to pray and to zeal; moreover, he                  Scritti,  vol.  2  p.  306).

In the Declarations and Promises, XXII, we read that being evangelical laborers of the                harvest of the Lord is an immediate and legitimate consequence of the Rogate. In any case, the                premise is superior to the consequence. Father Hannibal, in many other pages of the precious                                                                      17                heritage of his Writing, highlights this charismatic truth.                       A further proof that the peculiarity of the Rogationist charism lies in the first two areas                can be found in the affirmation of the first theologian-censor of the Founder's Writings:                               He was so concerned with the need of the Church to have numerous and                       worthy laborers and the effectiveness of the evangelical remedy to obtain them so                       much so that, to realize it, he moved, so to say, heaven and earth. This [the Rogate]                       was the reason for his life, the dominant note of his writings, the characteristic of                       his work (PS, Report of Father Valentino Macca).                       Father Hannibal moved earth and heaven not to build orphanages, but to have numerous                and worthy laborers, who would meet the needs of the orphans and poor throughout the earth.                  21.2. The prayer dimension of the fourth vow                        The first charismatic duty of the Rogationists is not to propagate and to act, but to pray.                Paul VI, in the audience granted to the Capitulars on September 14, 1968, defines in splendidly                charismatic terms that which essentially and primarily constitutes the mission of disciples of                Father Hannibal: The name itself qualifies you in the mission and in the image of worshipers                and implorers for the highest and most beautiful mission of meriting and preparing vocations                for the kingdom of God.                        The  Pope  clearly  says  that  the  first  absolute  mission  of  the  Rogationist  is  to  be                “worshipers” and “implorers”, or rather, the mission of the Rogationists and the Daughters of                Divine Zeal is primarily expressed and developed through their charismatic identity: being                “worshipers” and “implorers”. For this, they were called and sent.                       Paul VI affirms that the name Rogationist contains and signifies the being and the opus                of the Rogationist, that is, the identity and the praying mission of Father Hannibal’s disciples.                Therefore, it presupposes that the one who carries it must be such. In other words, precisely                because the name defines them, the Rogationists must fully express what the name signifies,                that is, “worshipers” and “implorers”. Also, with the expression qualifies you, Paul VI sees in                those who bear this name, not as generic worshipers, but specialists, who can elevate that being                worshipers and implorers to the best possible level. All this is justified and required by the fact                that their apostolate is aimed for the highest and most beautiful mission, that of meriting and                preparing vocations for the Kingdom of God.                        The document of the X General Chapter, in no. 9, reiterated this affirmation: The first                mission of the Rogationists is to obey the command of Jesus: Rogate.                        … it is perhaps the only Institute in the Church which is consecrated to the sublime mission revealed in the divine                17                words of the Gospel: Rogate... (Declarations and Promises, II).                   In order to extend this charity, if possible to all the world, so as to embrace intentionally and universally the                greater  spiritual  and  temporal  benefits of  my present  and  future  neighbors,  I  will  consider  the  Evangelical                Rogation of  the  Heart  of  Jesus as  the most efficacious means, which forms the special mission of this Pious                Institute (Declarations and Promises, IV).                                                              71","An authoritative comment on the definition of Paul VI is offered by John Paul II at the                meeting with the Capitulars on June 26, 2004: “Rogate”: with this invitation, Jesus asks that                your whole life become a prayer and that this prayer give life to credible witnesses to Christ                who are in love with him and his Gospel.                        Let us listen to Father Hannibal who, in educating his disciples to the obedience of the                divine command, is decidedly categorical:  that “therefore” obliges us, urges us, we could                almost say, compels us to correspond directly to this command, and to win holy vocations of                new priests with our persistent, humble, and trustful prayers (AR, p. 672).                       Obliges, urges, demands: a sequence of words that clearly indicate the duty and the                urgency to obey the Rogate, the charism that determines the vocation and mission of those                consecrated to the Rogate: which is precisely the evangelical Rogation. It is not an obligation                that urges and compels from the outside, but it must be felt like an innate need of which the                Rogationist cannot do without because the charism of the Rogate is a constitutive element of                his being.                        According to  the example and command of Jesus,  we can safely  conclude that the                mission of the disciples of Father Hannibal is first of all and above all prayer because their                vocation is essentially a mystery of prayer, of which the Founder had a full understanding.                Between the evangelical  Rogation and those consecrated to  the Rogate, there should be  a                relationship of identity. This relationship reached the highest absolute level in Father Hannibal,                and we can affirm that he was a man-made-Evangelical Rogation.                        At the community level, the Founder writes in the letter to Father Jordan, the Institute                must be like the fireplace which keeps the sacred fire of this spirit of prayer always alive and                the zeal of its propagation ever fervent (MB III, p. 482; cf. Lettere, vol. I, p. 397).                       In  referring  to  the  apostolic  works  of  the  Rogationists,  the  art.  62  of  the  draft  of                             *                Constitutions  (see above) assigns the first place to the Testimony of the Rogate. It affirms that:                The first and natural apostolic service is fulfilled by our very existence transfigured by the                evangelical counsels. A “natural” service, precisely because it is in the very nature of our                charism. Therefore, if the communities of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal                do not  express  this  peculiar service, they would  fail in  the duty  required by their specific                charismatic state, that is, being specialists, teachers, and models of the prayer of vocational                fruitfulness.                       The Founder addressed this classic affirmation primarily to his spiritual children:                                Vocations, like efficacious grace, descend from on high, and if we do not                       pray, if we do not  carry out  the command of  Jesus  Christ,  vocations  will not                       descend, and the abundant effects of many labors and so much culture are not                       achieved. And all this because any effort of ours cannot infuse the effectual and                       fervent vocation, while the unanimous prayer of the Church can obtain it, and                       then the work of the bishops in the seminaries can be profitable and productive.                                We insist on saying that the only remedy is prayer, not using it means                       ignoring it, it means not having good vocations (AP, p. 127).                        That Word of Jesus Christ is a command of the zeal of his divine Heart. Consequently,                Father Hannibal frequently not only turns to the compassionate Heart of Jesus but pleads with                him so that the laborers of the Gospel would come from the same divine Heart. We cannot but                return, once again, to the most beautiful prayer that he composed in 1880: Let your Divine                Heart be open, O Jesus, and from it, may good and holy laborers to your Church come. Yes,                                                                 72","draw them from the depths of your Sacred Heart […]. Enrich your Church with this great and                priceless treasure of good laborers!                       In a prayer addressed to the holy apostles: Through your supplications, may the Blessed                Jesus draw them out from his divine Heart, and may they be faithful priests who act according                                           18                to the divine Heart of Jesus.                       The Founder transmits this deep conviction to the Sacred Allies, in the Preface to the                Precious Adhesions of 1919:                               Jesus our Lord, with those words, wanted to demonstrate that the salvation                       of this mystical harvest of souls are his Priests, but to obtain this inestimable good,                       it is necessary to ask the Supreme Owner, who is God, who is Jesus Himself. He                       wanted to instruct us that his Priests do not arise by chance, they do not form by                       themselves, they cannot be formed by human effort; but they come from the Divine                       Mercy, who creates them, who begets them, who gives them to the world, and, if                       we do not pray to have them, we cannot obtain them!                               Is it all this not obvious?                                God sends the Saints on earth. Is this not one of the greatest mercies that                       He bestows? How can we expect to receive it if we do not ask for it? The command                       of Jesus Christ is very clear: The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;                       “Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam” (PPA, 19,                       in Scritti, vol. 50, p. 192).                       Concluding this chapter, we refer to the words that Benedict XVI addressed to priests                and deacons in Freising, on September 14, 2006: they are a sublime and splendid resonance of                Father Hannibal's teaching.                               “Pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers.” This means that the                      harvest is ready, but God wishes to enlist helpers to bring it into the storehouse.                      God needs them. He needs people to say: yes, I am ready to become your harvest                      laborer; I am ready to offer help so that this harvest, which is ripening in people’s                      hearts  may  truly  be  brought  into  the  storehouses  of  eternity  and  become  an                      enduring, divine communion of joy and love. “Pray the Lord of the harvest” also                      means that we cannot  merely “produce” vocations; they must come from God.                      Vocation is not like other professions. We cannot simply recruit people by using the                      right kind of publicity or the correct type of strategy. The call which comes from                      the heart of God must always find its way into the heart of man. And yet, precisely                      so that it may reach into hearts, our cooperation is needed. To pray the Lord of the                      harvest means, above all, to ask him for this, to stir his heart and say: “Please do                      this! Rouse laborers! Enkindle in them enthusiasm and joy for the Gospel! Make                      them understand that this is a treasure greater than any other and that whoever has                      discovered it, must hand it on!” We stir the heart of God. But our prayer to God                      does not consist of words alone; the words must lead to action so that from our                      praying heart, a spark of our joy in God and the Gospel may arise, enkindling in                      the hearts of others a readiness to say “yes”. As people of prayer, filled with his                      light, we reach out to others and bring them into our prayer and into the presence                 18  To express the sending of the workers, both evangelists use the verb ekbállo, which means to expel, to cast out,                used above all for the expulsion of demons (Mt 7:22 and Lk 13:32). However, scholars agree that in our case,                ekbállo has the value of “casting out”, “taking out”, as if the Lord of the harvest took them out of himself, from                his Heart. The Founder, in his exegetical interpretation, goes further and even affirms that priests are begotten by                divine mercy.                                                              73","of God, who will not fail to do his part. In this sense, we must continue to pray the                      Lord of the harvest, to stir his heart, and together with God, touch the hearts of                      others through our prayer. And he, according to his purpose, will bring to maturity                      their “yes”, their readiness to respond; in other words, the constancy, through all                      this world’s perplexity, through the heat of the day and the darkness of the night, to                      persevere faithfully in his service. Hence, they will know that their efforts, however                      arduous, are noble and worthwhile because they lead to what is essential; they                      ensure that people receive what they hope for: God’s light and God’s love.                                                                                                                                       74","22. The mystery of ut mittat                         The  final  document  of  the  Rogationist  VII  General  Chapter  (1986)  Rogationist                Community  and  Communion,  in  the  chapter  “The  Rogate  at  the  center  of  the  communion                between God and the Rogationists”, maintains  in no. 24 that  inside the Trinity, there is  a                Rogationist dialogue; and affirms in no. 25: the Rogate is the key to enter the threshold of                Rogationist trinitarian communion.                        Three years earlier (1983), the SCRSI has affirmed in the document EE no. 18:                               Religious  consecration  establishes  a  particular  communion  between                       religious and God and, in him, between the members of the same institute. This is                       the basic element in the unity of an institute. […] The foundation of unity, however,                       is the communion in Christ established by the one founding gift.                        There is  no doubt  that each religious  Institute has  its  proper charism.  It also  has a                particular “key” that allows access to the Trinity, to establish a unique communion, and to                impose  a  specific  prayer  dialogue  following  the  typical  consecration  and  corresponding                apostolic commitments.                        The charismatic key that the Spirit gave to our Founder is the Rogate, which enables                the Rogationists to enter the mystery of the Trinitarian communion, to place themselves apud                Deum [with God / in the presence of God] with a name and an unrepeatable vocation, to answer                the specific call, assuming and all-encompassing their existence in the evangelical Rogation                willed by him as the most effective means of collaboration in the history of salvation.                        Called by the creative word of God, the Rogationists are deeply aware that (although                giving the right value to the apostolic activity) their specific apostolate, considered in the pure                state, primarily consists of praying to the Lord of the harvest to send laborers to his Church.                        In this perspective, Father Hannibal affirms, with clarity and determination, that the                characterizing and differentiating element of the particular communion in Christ is founded, in                an absolute way, on the objective set by the Rogationist prayer dialogue, that is, on the ut mittat,                to send good laborers in his Church. Thus, he writes:                               The  prayer  or  Evangelical  Rogation  that  leans  on  the  great  Rogate,                       commanded by blessed Jesus Christ, refers directly to the “mittat” […]. Now it is                       precisely  in  that  “mittat”  that  the  holy  vocations  of  new  priests  are  hidden;                       enclosed in that “mittat” is that infallible promise of a God, who commits himself                       to hear such prayer and to respond to it, by raising well-disposed souls, children                       dear to His Heart, pious and chosen young people, and instilling in their hearts                       the omnipotent breath of a holiest irresistible vocation of the Holy Spirit, who,                       when he calls for divine service and sacrifice, acts in the soul, shares a divine                       impulsive force, which, although leaving the human will entirely free, effectively                       impels the one called to achieve the desired good. He cannot find peace and quiet                       if he does not comply with such an omnipotent impulse. And these are those who                       are genuinely called, the priests formed by the Holy Spirit, through that prayer                       commanded by Our Lord Jesus Christ with those divine words: Rogate ergo…                       (AP, p. 131).                       That directly gives us the idea of an arrow directed and launched towards a single                objective: the ut mittat.                                                                75","Before dwelling on the mystery of the ut mittat, let us see, first of all, how Father                Hannibal demonstrates that he has absolutely precise ideas about the theological dimension of                the vocation to the religious state. He affirms that the Holy Spirit, by virtue of that prayer                commanded by Our Lord Jesus Christ, with the omnipotent breath of a holy vocation, freely                breaks into the heart of the one called. This action of the Spirit is so effective that, even if he                remains entirely free to accept or reject the invitation that comes from above, he finds no peace                and quiet except by consenting to such an omnipotent impulse.                        In this exquisitely autobiographical citation, furthermore, we read the manner and the                vocational experience lived by Father Hannibal himself. He confided to his closest companions                that his calling was a sudden, irresistible, and absolutely sure. Our Founder repeats the same                idea in a different context, where he says that the young man who prays this prayer with the                proper disposition if he does not have a vocation, could receive it. If he does, he actualizes it                by empowering it through the active intervention of the Spirit (cf. below, in 23.4).                        Regarding the peculiar finality of the charism of the Rogate, Father Hannibal maintains                that  there  is  a  difference  between  the  prayer  for  the  sanctification  of  the  clergy  (indeed                necessary) and the prayer commanded by Jesus with the Rogate. In a letter to Monsignor Guido                         *                Conforti  he writes:                               But it is a different thing to correspond literally to that divine command!                       Here it is a question of the powerful vocation of the Holy Spirit, who, after ten                       days of prayers, descended on the Apostles, still timid and uncertain, to form                       strong vocations out of them, which the Most High almost held suspended in his                       divine hands, waiting for the prayer commanded by him, to snatch them off and                       send them down into many prepared and willing hearts.                        And who can tell how many hundreds of thousands of them the Lord has under his gaze                       on earth? But how can one expect to have these graces if they do not ask for them, as                       the Lord himself commands it?” (Scritti, vol. 29, p. 163).                        The Evangelical Rogation is the “violent” means that God put in our hands to snatch                vocations from the Father's hands. The charismatic prayer of the Rogationist must be a violent                prayer, a struggle to the point of agony, like that of Jesus in the garden and on the cross.                        We can easily maintain that the Rogate is  not  only  the differentiating element  that                establishes our specific communion in the Trinity. But it is also the key to cross the threshold                of Trinitarian communion, to fathom the secret designs of God, to set in motion the action of                the heavenly Father and to influence mysteriously the divine decision itself: the ut mittat is                truly a mystery: God sends ... if we pray.                        Sending is the sovereign act of God, like creating. However, while in creating, God acts                without any collaboration, in sending his laborers to his harvest, he asks for man’s cooperation.                The transcendent freedom of God, at this point, seems not to be spontaneous but induced by                prayer. Indeed, with the Evangelical Rogation, the sovereign and creative act of God, while                maintaining the summits of his freedom - which pertains to the very divine essence -, it seems                that he wants to be conditioned by human freedom: if man prays, God sends; if man does not                pray, he does not send the vocations that he has held suspended in his hands. This process                indicates how much God takes prayerful collaboration seriously, to the point of granting those                who obey the Rogate to reach the heights of transcendence and, in a certain sense, to participate                in the will and power of God himself. All this involves the serious vocational responsibility of                the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal. Father Hannibal, who was perfectly aware                  *  EN: St. Guido Maria Conforti (1861-1931), Bishop of Parma and Founder of the Xaverian Missionaries.                                                              76","of this highest mission, which the Spirit entrusted to him, feels overwhelmed: This mission is                too sublime, and I feel annihilated!

Why must we pray?                         To solve the difficult problem of the scarcity of laborers, Jesus commands unceasing                prayer to the Lord of the harvest. It is a remedy that seems to be absurd. The Lord of the harvest                is God, the laborers are his, and He has every interest so that the crop, whose quantity and                urgency of harvesting he knows, is not lost. Despite everything, Jesus commands the prayer.                Father Hannibal, teacher and model of prayer, the man chosen by God to receive the “great                prayer” commanded by Jesus, gives a series of answers to the “mysterious why”.                  23.1. Because God wants it                        Father Tusino writes:                               The Father presents a difficulty: but how, if the harvest is God's property,                       “in messem suam,” why do we need to pray to have the laborers?                               And  he  answers  himself:  “All  that  God  has  disposed  to  do  for  our                       salvation,  he  ordained  that  we  do  it  through  our  prayer;  and  by  an  ineffable                       mystery, the omnipotent will of God, to be fulfilled, needs to be aided by the weak                       will of man, in the order of grace. God, Himself cannot gather the harvest of souls,                       that is, He cannot save them if they do not pray, if they do not want to pray” (AP,                       p. 126).                        The first reason, according to the Founder, is in the fact that God established that to                send good laborers, he wants our collaboration, which he expressed through the command:                Rogate.                  23.2. Because the benefit is exclusively ours                               Besides, it is necessary to pray to the Lord of the harvest, because if he                       sends laborers to his harvest, and if they harvest an abundant harvest, it is not for                       his advantage. The benefit is exclusively ours, that is to say, the salvation of men,                       of whom we must request and promote for each other with a prayer to God (AP,                       p. 126).                        Based on the truth of the faith by which all men are sons in the Son (Gal 4:5), the                Founder wants to tell us: if the Lord of the harvest is God, as God is our Father, in a certain                way the harvest is also ours since we are his children. The children, in effect, share the Father's                interests and assets. Furthermore, if the harvest symbolizes the multitude of men, each man is                our  brother;  and  precisely  because  we  are  children  of  the  same  Father,  we  all  have  to  be                solicitous and work for the salvation of all. Saint John reminds us of the example of Christ,                who, for the love of humanity, his brothers, addressed to the Father not a prayer made of words,                but an existential prayer: the sacrifice of one's life. Therefore, ours also must be an Easter                prayer. He laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers (1 Jn                3:16).                       We would have to imitate Saint Paul, who testifies to his faith in the disinterested and                personal love of Jesus with these moving words: The life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith                in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me (Gal 2:20).                                                                    78","23.3. We must obey because it is a command                        The Rogate is not an advice or an invitation, it is not an exhortation, but a categorical                command, an imperative with the same value as go, therefore, and make disciples of all peoples                (Mt 28:19).                                That word of Jesus Christ is a command of the zeal of his divine Heart. It                       is a word and a command with supreme importance, indeed an infallible remedy                       for the salvation of the Church and of society (Scritti, vol. 2, p. 307).                       When the person who prays becomes aware of the Rogate's objective soteriological                value,  he  feels  personally  involved  and  realizes  in  his  conscience  an  inescapable  co-                responsibility. Besides, it becomes clear that obeying the Lord's command is not an imposition                that comes from outside, but an internal need, a demand of the spirit, and he cannot avoid                expressing it with all the strength and as best as possible. For Father Hannibal, obedience to                the Rogate is a fire that burns in his bones:                               Maybe  I  am  getting  a  bit  too  intoxicated  on  this  thought.  Still,  Your                       Excellency knows that this great interest of the Most Holy Heart of Jesus, that is,                       the good evangelical laborers of the mystical harvest, formed the intoxication and                       spasm of my most miserable heart and that this is the divine mission of my least                       Institutes (Letter to Monsignor N. Zimarino, Bishop of Gravina, Trani, October                       11, 1910, in Scritti, vol. 58, p. 139).                        Father Hannibal can express these deep feelings of his soul because he indeed made                God's subjective love for men his own (Caritas Christi urget nos. The love of Christ impels us.                2 Cor 5:14).                  23.4. The Obedience to the Rogate fosters, confirms, and sustains vocation                       Our Founder writes:                                When this prayer with specific formulas infiltrate in the seminaries, the                       clerics, the students who are praying it will have a rule in view on how to succeed                       in their vocation, and how they should behave to achieve it; and, besides, their                       prayer may have the first effect on themselves. The good God will either give or                       increase in their young hearts the powerful, effective vocation. He alone can turn                       them into chosen priests and holy laborers in the vast field of the Holy Church                       (Scritti, vol. 50, p. 109).                                The clerics who are reciting daily those prayers attract divine mercy for                       their success and become increasingly imbued with the importance and mission                       of the priesthood and find in those prayers the rule of their conduct to sanctify                       themselves. They become good evangelical laborers for the divine glory and the                       salvation of souls (PPA 1901, in Scritti, vol. 61, p. 176).                       He who has a vocation to the priestly or religious state, in praying the Rogate prayer,                feels that he cannot avoid the stirrings that the Spirit who instills in his soul the desire and                enthusiasm to make himself available to the salvific plan and realize the call from the Lord. He                will have the grace of total availability, like Isaiah: “Whom shall I send? And who will go for                us?” Then I said: “Here I am, send me” (Is 6:8). He will let the Word of God lead him with                enthusiasm, like Samuel, who answered: “Speak, for your servant hears” (1 Sam 3:10); or like                Mary: “Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be done to me according to your word”                (Lk 1:38).                                                                79","Fittingly, St. Thomas defines prayer as placing oneself at the feet of the Lord, opening                and expanding our will, and making it available to embrace his project: Oratio est quædam                explicatio nostræ voluntatis apud Deum ut eam impleat. [Prayer is the unfolding of our will to                God that He may fulfill it. Summa Theologica Part III, Q21, Art. 1].                  23.5. Because Jesus prayed                        There is another reason, highlighted by our Founder: the example of Jesus Christ, who                teaches what he himself first practiced:                                Of our Lord, it is said that: cœpit facere et docere [he began to do and                       teach  (Acts  1:1)].  If  therefore,  He  commanded  the  Disciples  to  ask  for  the                       evangelical laborers with prayer, it means that He himself prayed for such a holy                       purpose. Indeed, before  calling  the Apostles,  he  prayed a whole night, as  the                                                            19                       Gospel tells us (Scritti, vol. 43, p. 22).                               In  these  days,  he  went  out  to  the  mountain  to  pray;  and  all  night  he                       continued in prayer to God. And when it was day, he called his disciples, and                       chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles (Lk 6:12-13).                       Only  in  this  passage  from  Luke  does  Jesus  spend  the  whole  night  in  prayer.  The                choosing of the apostles is an event of supreme importance that requires an entire night of                intimacy with the heavenly Father, to ask him to send those whom he would have given his                same powers and to whom he would have entrusted his same mission of salvation.                        Father Hannibal comments:                               The very example of our divine Redeemer shows how necessary this prayer                       is. He himself had to call to the holy priesthood the first ministers of the law of                       grace, those who had to be like the first fertile seed of the Catholic priesthood:                       then, what did He do? What means did he use to form the vocation of the twelve                       fishermen?  Before  seeking  for  them,  before  inviting  them,  He  retires  on  the                       mountain and prays! He prays on a mountain as if from there he wanted to make                       his ardent prayer ascend more directly to his Father; he prays in the night [...]                       accompanying his prayers cum lacrymis et clamore valido [with tears and loud                       cries. Heb 5:7] [...]. As soon as he descends from the mountain, still wet with tears                       and sweat, he calls the apostles to follow him, to make of them the chosen first                       fruits of his priesthood. What a lesson for all of us to understand how great such                                                                                              20                       a grace that must be asked with particular prayers! (Scritti, vol. 3, p. 38).                       The significant events in the life of Jesus are preceded by prayer. Jesus often retired                alone at night and prayed, preferably on the mountain, a privileged place of encounter with                God. Prayer falls in  the category of mystery.  In this  specific prayer of Jesus,  the mystery                becomes more mysterious, insofar as the choice of the Twelve is determined and dictated by                the heavenly Father.                       The Founder highlights Jesus’ way of praying cum lacrymis et clamore valido (Heb.                5:7). The Rogate commanded by Jesus, a prayer of vocational effectiveness must have the                characteristics of the prayer of Jesus, the prayer of the grain of wheat that dies.                       As in physics, the transformation of electrical energy produces heat in the transformers,                which allow the transport of current over long distances, so the prayer to obtain priests for the                 19  Pious remembrance on the occasion of the Eucharistic Congress held in Rome in June 1905.                20  News and Regulations for the Sacred Allies.                                                              80","Church, empowered to bring the light of faith to the farthest horizons, cannot but be like that                of Christ: a prayer that sheds blood.                                                                                                                                                 81","24. Evangelical Rogation and holiness                         Regarding the conditions for the effectiveness of the Rogationist apostolate - like any                other ministry - its spiritual fruitfulness is connected to our union with Jesus, like the branches                connected with the vine: I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in me and I in him,                he it is who bears much fruit (Jn 15:5). This link between union with Christ and fruitfulness is                particularly valid for the prayer of the Rogationist.                       Christ is at the same time the efficient, exemplary, and final cause of our mission,                insofar as our apostolate is aimed to produce above all that particular type of configuration to                Christ that is actualized in the priesthood and religious life.                       John Paul II attests:                                The very prayer of the \"Rogate\", source of an original form of apostolic                       life, is not merely a prayer addressed to God, but a prayer lived in God: for it is                       conceived in union with the merciful heart of Christ, motivated by the \"sighs\" of                       the Spirit (cf. Rom 8:26) and addressed to the Father, the source of all good                       (1997, Centennial of the works).                        For this reason, our prayer mission (= missione orante) assumes a strong union with                Christ. In other words, such an essential prayer for the coming of the kingdom demands from                those who were entrusted with it by the Spirit a life of mystical union, that is, a genuinely holy                life. And this is because:                        1. Prayer must be done in Christ: If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask                          whatever you will, and it shall be done for you (Jn 15:7).                        2. We must ask for good laborers in the name of Jesus. This requires our holiness; the                          hands that lay the prayer in the hands of Christ, who in turn presents it to the heavenly                          Father, cannot but be pure: Truly, truly, I say to you: if you ask anything the Father,                          he will give it to you in my name (Jn 16:23). In Christ, each man establishes a filial                          relationship with God; indeed, he lives the same divine life, making the relationship                          of the Son with his heavenly Father his own.                       3. Finally, it has to be done with Christ, who was raised at the right hand of the Father,                          who always lives to make intercession for them (Heb 7:25), the High Priest, holy,                          blameless, unstained (Heb 7:26), whom no one can accuse of sin (cf. Jn 8:46).                        Because of these reasons, it becomes clear that our life must reflect the holiness of our                Founder,  defined  by  Father  Vitale  as  an  angel  in  the  flesh.  Pure  and  limpid,  like  the                incorruptible light of the stars, Father Hannibal ascended the altar of the Lord every day, with                clean hands and a pure heart (Ps 24:4). He belonged to the category desired by Saint Paul                when he exhorted the Christians of Philippi  with these words:  May you be blameless and                innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst a crooked and perverse generation,                among whom you shine as lights in the world (Phil 2:15).                        The precept be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect (Mt 5:48) is the fundamental                law  for  every  Christian  and  much  more  for  religious  and  priests  who  have  to  strive  for                perfection through a permanent going out of themselves, to conform themselves to Christ until                they reach that identification that we admire in the saints and in particular in Saint Paul. As we                go deeper into the holy life of Father Hannibal, it becomes increasingly evident that he is truly                a man immersed and submerged with all his weight into the mystery of God.                                                                  82","Exhortations to holiness were given to the Rogationists by John Paul II, in the audience                           th                for the 150  anniversary of the birth of Father Hannibal, on December 6, 2001:                                What needs to be done to ensure that the vigorous tree, planted by your                       Blessed  Founder,  continues  to  bear  fruit  in  abundance?  Dear  Brothers  and                       Sisters,  the  answer  to  the  question  that  you  pondered  over  in  the  Jubilee                       Year, is age-old and yet ever  new:  it  is  holiness,  the  fertile  soil  in  which  your                       religious Family has grown, a soil that can still promise a hopeful and fruitful                       future in the new millennium.                       In the letter addressed to the Superior General, Father Giorgio Nalin, on the occasion                of the General Chapter (June 26, 2004), the Pope underlines the need of holiness, which must                characterize the Rogationists, fittingly as apostles of the Rogate:                               The call to the universal vocation of holiness that I wanted to propose once                       again in my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte (cf. nn. 30-31) rings out in                       particularly clear tones for the apostles of the \"Rogate\", whose mission is to spend                       themselves without reserve as humble and faithful workers at the service of the                       coming of God's Kingdom, praying daily for vocations, spreading this prayerful                       spirit everywhere and promoting all vocations.                       Again, John Paul II addresses the Irish religious (at Maynooth, October 1, 1979) with                these words:                                But  remember  always  that  your  first  field  of  apostolate  is  your  own                       personal lives. Here is where the message of the Gospel has first to be preached                       and lived. Your first apostolic duty is your own sanctification.                        In the Declarations and Promises, I, Father Hannibal exhorts his disciples to the highest                possible holiness:                                I enter this community without any thought of personal convenience, but                       through a call which I felt in my heart to give myself more completely to the service                       of God, for my own greater sanctification, and the greater good of souls. I felt                       drawn  to  do  this  by  means  of  regular  observance,  discipline,  the  exercise  of                       religious virtues, and the sacred bond of the religious profession. All aided by                       God’s grace and my goodwill.                       The holiness of the Rogationists is consequential to their charism. It is Saint Hannibal                who expresses it with this exhortation:                                Therefore, in the first place, it is necessary that we, who ask the Lord good                       laborers for the Holy Church, must not be bad laborers of the mystical vineyard.                       We must strive for our sanctification and the sanctification and good of all souls                       (AR, p. 86).                        In Declarations and Promises, XXII, after having asked to raise supplications and sighs                to the Most High to fill the Holy Church and the whole world with good and evangelical                laborers, he continues to emphasize the means to make prayer effective: and for this purpose,                in  the  first  place,  I  will  strive  for  my  sanctification  so  that  I  can  work  fruitfully  in  the                sanctification and salvation of others (AR, p. 718).                       As the Founder says, they cannot but be saints those who should:                               Incessantly implore the Most Holy Heart of Jesus, his Most Holy Mother,                       the Angels, and the Saints, so that the Holy and Divine Spirit may Himself raise,                       with omnipotent vocations, most chosen souls, priests of zeal and charity for the                                                               83","salvation of souls, and so that the Almighty God would want to create Himself                       these new chosen apostles and souls of highest holiness for every social class (AR,                       p. 665).                       Father Hannibal does not ask for “generic laborers”, but rather high-level specialists,                men of God in the stature of Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Dominic, Saint Alphonsus. He asks                for priests who are icons of the holiness of Jesus Christ because they are generated from the                Heart of Christ. The Founder addresses the Holy Spirit with a prayer to obtain these giants of                holiness,  wherein  the  groans  of  the  Holy  Spirit  are  united  with  those  of  the  praying                Rogationists, creating a choir and an entirely charismatic climate.                               Holy and Divine Spirit, please continually renew your divine Pentecost on                       earth. Raise new, holy, and zealous laborers of men and women in the entire                       world. Send from heaven your powerful and triumphant vocations. But you want                       your Pentecost to be preceded by unanimous and fervent prayer. You are always                       rain  down  the  righteous  from  the  sky,  but  justly  you  want  that  the  gaze,  the                       supplicating hands, the groans and sighs of the peoples rise to the sky so that you                       would want to open wide the heavens and rain down the holiest vocations on the                       earth, like living flames of fire. […] Now then, most adorable Holy Spirit, groan                       in us, and make us all cry with unspeakable sighs, […] to snatch from the most                       intimate yearning of the infinite mercy of the Heart of Jesus, this most excellent                       grace of all graces of the divine glory and the salvation of souls!                        Let us conclude with another attestation from Father Hannibal: This spirit of prayer for                this highest interest of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, that is, the grace to have good laborers for                the holy Church, I strive to make it the spirit and life of this Work (Letter to Father Cusmano,                February 19, 1885, in Scritti, vol. 58, p. 27).                                                                                                         84","25. The mystery of a presence                         Before proceeding to the reflection on the Rogate-Eucharist relationship, I consider it                is useful to begin with some concepts about the mystery of faith par excellence, which Christ                renews through the priest's ministry. The real, glorious, and pneumatological presence of Jesus                in the Eucharist is and will always remain a mystery, which transcends and surpasses our reason                but does not contradict it. The truth of the Lord's body and blood, after consecration, can be                accepted only through adherence to faith.                        When Jesus at the Last Supper says: This is my body - this is my blood; or better when                he says: I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he                will live forever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh (Jn 6:51),                he does not intend to speak of his physical body limited by the space-time coordinates, but of                                                                                                 21                his body in the glorious state, enlivened by the Spirit, at the right hand of the Father.                         The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are present in the Eucharistic mystery, on the                foundation of the unique divine essence, by virtue of the intimate and reciprocal immanence or                interpenetration  (circumincession,  perichoresis).  This  unity-communion  in  love  repeatedly                revealed in the Gospel of John (cf. Jn 10:38; 14:11) can exist in the Eucharist as well.                       However, the presence of the Father and the Spirit in the Eucharist is not of the same                nature as that of Jesus. The Father and the Spirit cannot say: “This is my body” because only                the Son was incarnated by the Holy Spirit in the womb of the Blessed Virgin.                        In as much as the Most Holy Trinity in the Eucharist, consequently, the Trinity in the                                                                                                   22                universe with all creatures. In him, we live and move and have our being (Acts 17:28).                       Benedict XVI, in the post-synodal apostolic exhortation Sacramentum Caritatis no. 8,                affirms:                               The  Eucharist  […]  there  the Deus  Trinitas,  who  is  essentially  love  (1                       Jn 4:7-8), becomes fully a part of our human condition. In the bread and wine                       under  whose  appearances  Christ  gives  himself  to  us  in  the  paschal  meal                       (Lk 22:14-20; 1  Cor 11:23-26),  God's  whole  life  encounters  us  and  is                       sacramentally  shared  with  us.  God  is  a  perfect  communion  of  love  between                       Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.                       The Holy Trinity is present here on earth also in each one of us. This doctrine flows                from the dogma of sanctifying grace, which is an anticipation or inauguration of eternal life.                Benedict XVI, in the Angelus of the Solemnity of the Holy Trinity (June 11, 2006) affirmed:                               Those who encounter Christ and enter into a friendly relationship with him                       welcome into their hearts Trinitarian Communion itself, in accordance with Jesus'                       promise to his disciples:  \"If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father                       will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him\" (Jn 14: 23).                     21  By virtue of the words, the body is under the species of bread and the blood under the species of wine. By virtue                of natural concomitance, under the species of bread, we have not only the body but also the blood and, vice versa,                under the species of wine.                22  Enrico Medi, a scientist and a man of great faith, speaking of the Eucharist, said: There is everything inside:                there is the universe, power, light, faith, greatness, history, men, judgment, hell, the Paradise, eternity; there is                God the Father, there is the love of the Holy Spirit, there is the immaculate body of Christ and the blood of Mary,                which became the blood of Christ.                                                              85","Every time the Rogationists sign themselves with the sign of the cross, they have the                opportunity to rekindle this divine reality, also in a charismatic dimension. When they say: “In                the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,” they do not only express an act of                faith, or only plunge themselves into the ocean of God's infinite love, spiritually renewing an                                                                                                   23                act of Eucharistic worship, but they rekindle the memory of the eucharistic genesis.  They                offer once again their actions and their very selves, together with Jesus Christ on the cross, to                obtain holy priests.                        The Rogationists in all the celebrations or participation in the Eucharist, among the                many intentions,  cannot  fail to  include and privilege that of obtaining  holy  priests for the                Church of the Lord.                        Our holy Founder’s faith in the divine presence and the conduct of faith that he reserved                for  the  Eucharist  reach  the  summits  in  front  of  him,  probably  still  unclimbed.  We  read  a                wonderful confession that Father Hannibal made to his spiritual director in 1890, about the age                of thirty-nine and after twelve years of his priestly consecration:                                Father, I feel  a great  desire for  Our Lord  Jesus  Christ  and his  divine                       Presence is so sweet to me. I would like to do much for his glory and the salvation                       of souls. I would like to become a great saint for this purpose (PS, vol. 2, p. 1198).                       From the many testimonies, from the confidences he made to those close to him and,                above all, from his life, it becomes indisputably clear that the Eucharistic presence constituted                the  habitat  of  him  who  in  the  Eucharist  has  recognized  the  foundation  and  reason  of  the                religious Congregations he started. The indicative signs of his not-so-common faith in the                Eucharistic presence are innumerable and, in some cases, decidedly heroic (cf. AP, p. 92).                Father  Hannibal’s  passion  for  the  Eucharist  was  real,  alive,  intense,  enthusiastic,  all-                encompassing, passionate, impetuous, characterized by a spiritual childhood of extraordinary                beauty.                       This original Eucharistic habitat could not be a personal privilege, but he wished it to                belong to all the members of the Pious Work. In the sermon on the title of Jesus The Solitary                Dweller of the Holy Tabernacles (May 11, 1913), the Founder seems to take the Pious Work                by the hand, bring it to the tabernacle, and address Jesus with these words:                                Open to me the door of every holy tabernacle. Make me enter; I am the                       Pious and humble Work of the interests of your Heart, I want to keep you company,                       perpetual and faithful company, I want to love with you, I want to suffer with you,                       I want to offer myself to you, I want to groan and pray with you (Scritti, vol. 54,                              24                       p. 63).                  23  All this has been written so that the memory remains perpetual and we never lose sight of the fact that Jesus in                the Blessed Sacrament was the Author of this His Pious Work consecrated to his Divine Heart, which is always                alive and true, loving and palpitating in the holy tabernacle, always working in our midst with that divine grace                of which he in the Most Holy Eucharist is an infinite abyss; working with those divine lights that continually                radiates from the most ardent furnace of his divine Heart in the sacrament. Therefore, all our thanks, all our                praises, all our affections, all our sighs, all our longings, all our thoughts, all our love, all our being, must first                of all be directed to the adorable Sacramental Jesus. (Regulations for the Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart                of Jesus, December 15, 1920)                24  For Father Hannibal, the Eucharist was the holy mountain:                   1. Sinai, where the Holy Spirit had given him the divine command of the Rogate, with the corresponding law;                   2. Moriah, where he offered himself for the glory of God and the salvation of souls, through total consecration                to the Rogate;                   3. Calvary, where he gladly united his crosses to that of Christ, so that the Evangelical Rogation would become                universal.                                                              86","st                       Father Hannibal searched with all means and with effective initiatives (July 1 , sacred                street sweepers, and many others) to transmit his Eucharistic faith to his followers. A coherent                faith, which had to be expressed in the way of behaving and relating to Jesus in the Eucharist                and extended to the sacred places where he was sacramentally present. In the area of Eucharistic                devotion,  the  Founder's  gestures,  animated  by  his  living  faith,  had  a  precise  pedagogical                function. It was a Eucharistic catechesis in action, which profoundly affected the soul of the                first disciples, the poor, the children, who had to internalize the certainty of the divine, real,                substantial, and personal presence of Jesus and firmly believe that entering in the chapel, they                came  to  the  sacred  place,  the  space  of  God,  of  the  one  who  always  maintains  his  loving                transcendence.                       He wrote, on August 2, 1897, the “penal regulation” for the young girls, composed of                twenty-six articles, on the way of behaving in church and reciting prayers (cf. Scritti, vol. 5, p.                19).                                                                             4. Tabor, where he carried out the continuing process of his transfiguration and conformation to the Christ of                the Rogate;                   5. Carmel, because he could not imagine Jesus without Mary. Indeed, he believed that, together with Jesus,                Mary had been also a bearer of the Rogate.                                                              87","26. Eucharist and Rogation                         The Rogationists, who pray the evangelical Rogation within the Holy Trinity present in                the Eucharist, have the certainty of being heard. They could raise their eyes to heaven and say                like and with Jesus Christ at the moment of raising Lazarus: Father, I thank you for you have                heard me; I knew that you hear me always (Jn 11:41-42). And this for various reasons.                        1. Because it is a prayer commanded by Jesus, and it cannot but be heard: This prayer                commanded by Christ is infallible in its effect; otherwise, we would have to say that Jesus                Christ commanded it in vain (PPA 1919).                       2. Because in the Eucharistic celebration, we pray in total spiritual communion with                Christ, we incorporate ourselves into the prayerful activity of Jesus. Indeed, through the work                of the Holy Spirit, in the Eucharistic celebration, with Christ, we become one priest - one victim                – one offering. In the epiclesis of communion, we ask the Lord to send his Spirit to act in us                this new being in Christ: Look, we pray, upon the oblation of your Church and, recognizing                the sacrificial Victim by whose death you willed to reconcile us to yourself, grant that we, who                are nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit, may become                one body, one spirit in Christ (EP 3).                       Benedict XVI in the apostolic exhortation SC, to make us understand in some way this                involvement with Christ in the Eucharist, resorts to an analogy of a current scientific interest,                such as the nuclear fission:                                The Eucharist draws us into Jesus’ act of self-oblation. More than just                       statically receiving the incarnate Logos, we enter into the very dynamic of his self-                                                             25                       giving.” He “draws us into himself.”  The substantial conversion of bread and                       wine into his body and blood introduces within creation the principle of a radical                                                           26                       change, a sort of “nuclear  fission”   to  use an image familiar  to us today. It                       penetrates to the heart of all being; a change meant to set off a process which                       transforms reality, a process leading ultimately to the transfiguration of the entire                       world, to the point where God will be all in all (1 Cor15:28) (SC 11).                       In the same document, the Pope remarks that the Eucharistic celebration is the work of                Christus totus and recalls the daring words of Saint Augustine:                                The  great  Bishop  of  Hippo,  speaking  specifically  of  the  eucharistic                       mystery, stresses the fact that Christ assimilates us to himself: “The bread you see                       on the altar, sanctified by the word of God, is the body of Christ. The chalice, or                       rather, what the chalice contains, sanctified by the word of God, is the blood of                       Christ. In these signs, Christ the Lord willed to entrust to us his body and the                       blood which he shed for the forgiveness of our sins. If you have received them                       properly, you yourselves are what you have received.” Consequently, “not only                  25  Several times Benedict XVI repeats this thought:                   Once again, I must return to the Eucharist. \"Because there is one bread, we, though many, are one body\",                says St Paul (I Cor 10: 17). By this he meant:  since we receive the same Lord and he gathers us together and                draws us into himself, we ourselves are one. (WYD, August 21, 2001).                   Christ is truly present among us in the Eucharist. His presence is not static. It is a dynamic presence that                grasps us, to make us his own, to make us assimilate him. Christ draws us to him, (Bari, May 29, 2005).                   Through this gaze of adoration, he draws us toward himself, within his mystery, through which he wants to                transform us as he transformed the Host. (Homily in the Solemnity of Corpus Christi, June 15, 2006).                   Nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction in which atoms of uranium 235, plutonium 239, or other suitable heavy                26                elements are divided into fragments in a process that releases energy.                                                              88","have we become Christians, but we have also become Christ himself.” We can                       thus contemplate God's mysterious work, which brings about a profound unity                       between ourselves and the Lord Jesus: “one should not believe that Christ is in                       the head but not in the body; rather he is complete in the head and the body” (SC                       36).                       Furthermore, the Eucharistic celebration is the most pleasing prayer to the Lord of the                harvest, because, in the Eucharist, the Son of God does not pray to say words but offers his                own body in sacrifice. In offering the Eucharistic sacrifice, the Rogationist does not limit his                prayer to verbal expressions, but in Christ and with Christ, he becomes one sole victim - one                sole  offering  -  according  to  the  teaching  of  Vatican  II:  Participating  in  the  Eucharistic                sacrifice, source and summit of all the Christian life, they offer God the divine Victim and offer                themselves together with it (LG 11). Not only that, but by accepting the exhortation of Saint                Paul, he extends this offering at all times throughout the day: I urge you, therefore, brothers,                by the mercy of God, to present your bodies as a living, holy, and pleasing sacrifice to God;                this is your spiritual worship (Rom 12:1-2).                       John Paul II addresses the Rogationists (May 16, 1997, Centennial of the Congregation)                and invites them to follow the Founder’s example, with these words:                                The first condition is to put the Blessed Eucharist at the center of personal                       and community life, in order to learn from it how to pray and love according to                       the Heart of Christ, indeed, to unite the offering of his own life with the offering                       Christ makes of his, continuing to intercede with the Father on our behalf (cf. Heb                       7:25; 9:24). After the founder’s example, may every member of the Rogationist                       family be a profoundly Eucharistic soul!                        The Holy Father, who raised Father Hannibal to the honors of the altar, the authentic                and qualified interpreter of his charismatic thought and doctrine, has the certainty that the                Evangelical Rogation reaches the summit of perfection in the Eucharist: The Eucharist is the                culmination of ecclesial prayer: in this the prayer of Christ and of the Church for vocations is                fulfilled according to the Lord’s explicit mandate: Rogate, ergo, Dominum messis ut mittat                operarios in messem suam (Mt 9:38). Rogate!  Rogationists! (Address to the Rogationists, July                26, 1997).                        Father Hannibal was deeply convinced of the efficacy of the Eucharistic prayer to obtain                good laborers. Hence, from the early days of his mission in the Avignone Quarter, as a wise                pedagogue and mystagogue, he catechized his children so that they understood the nature and                value of the Eucharist. He writes:                               Since the teaching on the infinite value of the Holy Mass predominates in                       this Pious Work and everyone is educated to consider it as the center of divine                       wonders, as the most effective, indeed infallible means to obtain every grace, thus                       each day the Holy Mass is offered with the recitation of a special short prayer to                       obtain good Laborers for the Holy Church (PPA 1901).                                The understanding of the Holy Mass was enhanced as much as possible.                       He made it clear that with the offering of the Holy Mass, every grace is obtained;                       that the Holy Mass is everything, that when the Divine Victim is sacrificed, the                       heavens open and graces rain down (PPA 1919).                               Needless to say, the daily Holy Mass was applied for these intentions, for                       which no offerings were received, in order not to divide the daily intentions of the                       special fruit of the great Sacrifice”                                                                89","We quote here one of the many prayers to obtain holy priests, raised to the Lord through                the merits of Christ in the Eucharistic. With the usual all-encompassing note, our Founder                unites his supplication to obtain holy priests to the intimate groans of the Spirit and retraces all                the moments of the liturgical action and all the mysteries of the life of Christ:                                O most loving Father, God of all consolation, we ask you for this most                       desired  grace  with  the  infinite  groans  of  the  Spirit  for  the  love  of  your  Only                       Begotten Son who now, by your grace, we offer You at the altar. From the moment                                                     *                       we say Introibo ad altare Dei,  we intend that all the sacred words of the Holy                       Mass, all the rites, and gestures, would be like so many ardent supplications with                       which we implore from your divine clemency that most desired grace.                                And in the solemn moment in which we raise the Body and Blood of your                       divine Son, in that deep silence, we want to present to you all the mysteries of the                       life, passion, and death of your Only Beloved Son and we want to say to you: Holy                       Father, listen to us for the love of Jesus, your Son.                        At this point, the supplication unfolds like a movie, that recapitulates the whole life and                passion of Jesus:                        1. by his incarnation,                       2. by the nine months in which he did not abhor being enclosed within the womb of the                Immaculate Virgin,                       3. by his birth,                        and it continues so until the abandonment on the cross and his most bitter death; finally,                it concludes: Holy Father, hear us and give us the priests that we desire (Prayers to the Lord                in Scritti vol. 1, no. 143).                        Father Hannibal dares to keep going. And what does he do? As if freezing in a frame                of the most dramatic scene of Jesus’ earthly existence, he turns the heavenly Father and tells                him to look at the face of his Son on the cross:                                In those solemn moments, we intend to present to you the adorable Body                       of Jesus your Son as He was on the cross when He addressed You to intercede for                       the cause of humanity, […]. We intend to tell you: Holy Father, respice in faciem                       Christi tui. Look upon the face of your anointed. (Ps 83:10 Vulg. / Ps 84:9)) [...]                       so that our supplication may be worthy to enter before your presence and be heard                       (Prayers to the Lord in Scritti vol. 1, n. 143).                        Afterward,  Father  Hannibal  leaves  Calvary,  re-enters  in  himself,  and  the  prayer                resounds at the moment of the most intimate intimacy with the body of Christ:                                When the most precious body and the blood of the divine victim have                       descended already in our miserable heart through the consummation of the sacred                       species with which the immense sacrifice is accomplished, oh, then in the brief                       moment of recollection, with the divine Treasure that is in us, we beseech you,                       saying:  Holy  Father  […]  accept  our  humble  supplication;  look  kindly  at  our                       present need. Please, send us chosen priests (Prayers to the Lord in Scritti vol. 1,                       n. 143).                   *  EN: Introibo ad altare Dei [I will go up to the altar of God], taken from Psalm 42, are the first words which,                until the reform of the Liturgy by the Vatican Council II, the priest pronounced at the foot of the altar at the                beginning of the Mass.                                                              90","Always brilliant and original, Father Hannibal imagines the scene of the calling to the                priesthood within the Eucharist, through the living voice of Christ and the shooting of loving                arrows, from the depths of the sacred tabernacles. This is how the prayer articulates:                                O Most Adorable Lord Jesus, to You, hidden in the most ineffable mystery                       of your infinite love, we raise our ardent groans. O Restorer of the human family,                       deign to send the good evangelical laborers for the salvation of all peoples. Oh,                       even if you remain hidden under the Eucharistic species, your Divine Heart is not                       silent, your omnipotent Word is not silent; shoot your loving arrows and call                       young men to the priesthood; make your sweetest voice be heard from the depths                       of the holy tabernacles in all Catholic cities, by many young people, by many                       children, and call them efficaciously to your sanctuary (Scritti, vol. 6, p. 21).                        John Paul II, in tune with the thoughts of Father Hannibal, affirms that the Eucharist is                the  most  effective  theological  environment  for  vocational  prayer  and  discernment  of  the                vocation of young people:                                The centrality of the Eucharist in the life and ministry of priests is the basis                       of  its  centrality  in  the pastoral  promotion  of  priestly  vocations.  It  is  in  the                       Eucharist that prayer for vocations is most closely united to the prayer of Christ                       the Eternal High Priest. At the same time, the diligence of priests in carrying out                       their  Eucharistic  ministry,  together  with  the  conscious,  active,  and  fruitful                       participation of the faithful in the Eucharist, provides young men with a powerful                       example and incentive for responding generously to God's call. Often it is the                       example of a priest's fervent pastoral charity which the Lord uses to sow and to                       bring to fruition in a young man's heart the seed of a priestly calling (EdE 31).                        It is useful to re-read what was written, about the same topic, in no. 19 of the final                document of the second International Congress for Vocations:                               The Eucharist has a decisive importance for each vocation. The Lord Jesus                       is present there as the one who gives himself to everyone and makes himself bread                       for the life of the world. The Eucharist is the source of the ministerial priesthood,                       the  source,  and  culmination  of  the  entire  Christian  life  and  of  every  total                       consecration to the cause of the Gospel. The Christian community must convert                       itself to the Eucharistic adoration. This adoration must start from consecrated                       persons. In the beginning, Jesus chose the first collaborators among the people                       who were with Him. Even today, many receive His calling in being close to Him                       in adoration, in receiving Him, in participating in the Eucharistic Sacrifice, in                       serving at the altar.                       In the current order of providence, the Evangelical Rogation is a mystery that finds                space and light in the Eucharist, where the Father’s action of the sending is pleaded by the                oblation of the crucified, risen, and glorious Son, through the work of the Holy Spirit.                        In the Eucharist, the evangelical Rogation prayed with Jesus Christ  passed into the                heavens (Heb 4:14); from the heavens, his Spirit descends on earth, and places in the depths of                the hearts and minds of many young people and children the vocation to the priesthood and/or                to  the  life  of  total  religious  consecration.  Once  again,  we  must  affirm  that  the  privileged                theological place to answer the Lord’s command is the Eucharist, where:                       •  the Father holds the vocations in his hands;                        •  the Son offers himself as a victim together with those who pray, so that the Father                           may send;                                                               91","•  the Holy Spirit reaches those who are called, brings the charism, and consecrates                           those whom the Father calls through the Son.                                                                                                                                                 92","27. The Eucharist, Perennial Spring of the Rogate                            The event and the charismatic moment that marked the vocation of Father Hannibal                did not begin and end in the Church of St. John of Malta but they are actual history, which is                repeated similarly, without interruption, in front of the tabernacle, in every Rogationist today,                within the Congregation.                         It is an experience of the Spirit, as a result of the charismatic state, that persists in the                Congregation,  extends  all  times,  and  invades  all  spaces  on  the  planet,  where  there  are                Rogationists. They will be able to have the full Christological and ecclesial understanding of                the Rogate-word, not only through reading and the necessary exegetical insights of the passages                of Matthew and Luke but, above all, by learning directly from the Christ of the Rogate, who is                present in the sacrament of the altar, provided that they let themselves be led by the Spirit - the                only one who can make us know the full truth of the specific consecration (cf. Jn 16:13).                         In the prologue of his Gospel, John reveals the mystery of the incarnation of the Word                                                                               27                and his presence among us: … and He dwelt among us (Jn 1:14).                         Father Hannibal  exults  with  deep joy  because the same  Word of God incarnated,                finally, after two years of prayerful and fervent waiting, came among his own in the Avignone                Quarter and radiates and makes himself present in the sacramental signs in all Rogationist                religious communities of the world:                                  1.  He  came  not  to  leave  anymore,  […]  but  to  stay  with  his  divine                         presence.                                 2. He came as a loving father in the midst of his children,                                  3. to form a small family, that                                 4. lived on his flesh and blood, and                                 5. was made capable by his real Presence in Sacrament to be able to                         receive                                  6. from his divine lips the Command of the Divine Zeal of his Heart:                         “Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam”; and this                         command is in the most intimate connection with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament,                         who  cannot  subsist  -  having  Himself  decreed  so  -  without  the  Priesthood                         (Regolamento per le Figlie del Divino Zealo del Cuore di Gesù, December 15,                         1920).                          He came: the first movement is always from God-Father, who creates, sustains, loves                all his children.                         Father Hannibal sees in the face of the Eucharistic Christ the face of the Father - Who                has seen me has seen the Father (Jn 14:9) - a most loving Father who evokes the tenderness of                God of the Old Testament (Jer 31:20; Is 49:15) and even more of the Gospels (Mt 6:8. 31-32;                especially the parables of mercy), which reveal not only that God is love, but that this love was                     … he pitched his tent (eskénosen) among us. John certainly alludes both to the tent of the desert, as well as to                27                the temple of Jerusalem, places where God made himself present in the midst of his people. With the incarnation                of the Word, his humanity becomes the true sanctuary. Saint Paul, in the letter to the Colossians 2:9, affirms: For                in Christ the fullness of divinity dwells in human form. It must also be remembered that the Jews, in order not to                pronounce the name of God who is present in the temple, used this expression: shekiná, which means presence.                Now, in the time of the Church, the Logos is the shekiná, the living presence of God among us.                                                              93","incarnated in the crucified Christ. He is the merciful love who desires all men to be saved and                come to the knowledge of truth (1 Tm 2:4), through the bearers of the truth, particularly the                priests, whom we ask the Lord of the harvest with the prayer commanded by Christ.                          Furthermore, the Founder sees the Father in the Eucharist because he is the final goal                of our prayer: in liturgical celebrations, all prayers are addressed to the Father through Christ                in the Spirit.                          He came: to form a family, the family of the Rogate.                         The Son Jesus gathers the Rogationists around the Eucharistic table to form a small                family that would live on his flesh and blood with a precise objective and a specific purpose:                to make it able to receive from his divine lips the imperative of the zeal that “devoured” his                heart: the Rogate ... infallible resource for the salvation of the Church and of society (AP,  p.                134). The Founder, in the living on, highlights the necessary condition to be able to receive                from his divine lips the Rogate: to become “Eucharist”, in the dimensions of prayer (=orante),                pasch of sacrifice, and charity.                         From his lips: that of Jesus in the Eucharist is a living, palpitating, dynamic, and active                presence. According to our Founder, the Rogationists must sit at the feet of Jesus the Master,                like Mary of Bethany, to listen to him, to understand and acquire the mystery of the Rogate for                the coming of the Kingdom.                          The Rogate is a word that, from the depths of the Eucharistic Heart of Christ, passes                on his lips and from his lips, as a vital breath, it is stored in the hearts of his children, who,                through a truly Eucharistic life and guided by the Spirit, they carry out the specific vocational                project. Not once, but many times the Founder repeats the same charismatic truth:                                 Each Rogationist receives from the adorable mouth of Jesus Christ that                       divine command that he should consider as coming from the Divine Zeal of the                       Heart of Jesus: “Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem                       suam”  (Regole  della  Pia  Congregazione  dei  Rogazionisti  del  Cuore  di  Gesù,                       November 9, 1914).                                 The  purpose  of  our  little  Congregation  is  that  of  receiving  from  the                       adorable mouth of Jesus Christ Our Lord that divine word out of charity and the                       zeal  of  his  most  loving Heart:  Rogate  ...  (Regolamento  per  la  Congregazione                       Religiosa, April 24, 1901).                                They must receive from the adorable lips of Jesus Christ Our Lord this                       divine  command  that  came  from  the  divine  zeal  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus,  which                       contains a secret of the salvation of the Holy Church and of the Society (Draft of                       the Constitutions FDZ, November 6, 1912).                               They receive, we could almost say, from the adorable lips of the Divine                       Master these ardent words [Rogate, etc…]; if they intend to pierce through the                       depths (= viscera) of the spirit, into the deepest fibers of the heart; they belong                       totally to the divine Rogate if they have assimilated it as the hope of their existence                       in Jesus, in their longings for the glory of the Father and the salvation of souls                       (AR, p. 670).                       In the Regulations of the Divine Superiors no. 10, we can find a description of the                vibrant  scene  where  every  Rogationist  who  comes  into  the  world  relives  the  Founder's                charismatic experience. The words we read here seem to reproduce faithfully the “vision” of                the historical encounter that Father Hannibal had with Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament in the                                                                 94","Church of St. John of Malta. It is a detailed, vivid, lively, and vibrant description of particulars;                reading it is like seeing it projected on a screen.                               1. He will see the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, divine superior, afflicted in                                                                             *                       the holy tabernacles due to the scarcity of both clergies ,                               2. points out to him the two identical verses of the Gospel of Saint Luke                       (10:2) and Saint Matthew (9:37),                                3. shows him the abandoned souls like sheep without a shepherd,                               4. invites him to look at the vast and most extensive harvest, which perishes                       due to the lack of laborers and                               5.  tells  him:  “Here  is  a  rule  [of  life]  that  I,  together  with  my  Blessed                       Mother, as sweet, kind, and loving superiors, give you:                               6. do not grow weary of praying to the Lord of the harvest, who is I, and                       (pray to) my Father in my Name and (to) my Most Holy Mother,                                7.  so  that  we  may  soon  send  many  and  holy  laborers  to  the  mystical                       harvest;                                8. and you strive to become such for my glory and the salvation of souls,                       in whatever condition of this religious life I will assign you (AR, p. 1012).                         Father Hannibal brings the Rogationist before the tabernacle and, with the sequence of                nine verbs that we find in the text, proposes to him the various moments of charismatic lectio                divina. First of all, he calls into question the spirit of faith in the Eucharistic mystery. The faith                that Father Hannibal demands must be so deep as to see Jesus Christ in the symbol of his                infinite love, which is precisely his Heart, as if he were physically present: He will see the                Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, the divine superior. In this framework, Jesus himself places the                Gospel before the eyes of the Rogationist, and points out the passages of the Rogate in the                versions of Matthew and Luke, obviously to read them (lectio) and realize every element that                makes up the scene (explicatio). Then through the meditatio, he tries to fathom and assimilate                the values and reasons  that are proposed in  the context  of the passages. Then follows the                contemplatio of everything that moves on the scene, starting with the people and their feelings                and characteristics.                       Let us briefly analyze the citation.                        1. The Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, aside from being the founder, is also the divine                superior.                        The Rogationist cannot forget the charismatic testament left by the Founder, concerning                the Eucharist: He must know and retain now and in perpetuity that this Pious Work has for its                true, effective, and immediate founder Jesus in the Sacrament (AP, p. 272; Scritti, vol. 1, p.                111).                       For this reason, among his many spiritual initiatives, on July 1, 1913, in Oria, after an                intense preparation of the community, Father Hannibal wanted to give his disciples further                reason  to  prove  that  the  Institute  of  the  Rogationists  is  truly  a  Eucharistic  Institute,  by                proclaiming the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus as Superior of the Rogationists:                   * EN: Both clergies means the diocesan and the religious clergy.                                                              95","All present and future Rogationists will always retain, in conformity with                       the two proclamations, the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus and the Most Holy Virgin                       Immaculate  as  immediate,  absolute,  and  effective  superiors,  who,  although                       invisible, are always present in their midst. They will always see them visible in                       every order, command, and direction of those who have authority over them (AR,                       p. 1009; Scritti, vol. 60, n. 825).                       Furthermore,  Father  Hannibal  testifies  that  Jesus  not  only  founds  the  works  of  the                Rogate but remains in them with his dynamic presence and continues to care for his works.                Indeed, he plants and cultivates them: He came as a divine farmer to cultivate by his very self                his little plant, in whose sprout buried underneath the soil of trial and mortification, is enclosed                the small seed of his divine “Rogate”.                        The soil of trial and mortification: this soil is the Rogationist, who has to let himself be                “trampled upon” by suffering and sacrifice to be fruitful and produce the most (cf. below, in                35).                        2. … afflicted in the holy tabernacles due to the scarcity of both clergies ...                       We have repeatedly pointed out that Jesus in the Sacrament of the altar is in the glorious                state, so he is not subject to mutations of feelings. However, the Founder invites us to imagine                Jesus, still on the streets of Palestine, who, at the time described by Matthew and Luke, is                afflicted with a heart swollen with compassion. He addresses the Rogationists, who remain                before the tabernacle and, as in a vision - we are still in the stage of the contemplatio of the                lectio - Jesus…                       3. … shows him the abandoned souls as sheep without a shepherd and …                        4. … invites him to look at the vast and most extensive harvest, which perishes due to                the lack of laborers …                        The souls and harvests of our time that need to be saved before they perish are many,                so he asks for a collaboration that must qualify and govern the life of the Rogationist. In fact,                       5. …he tells him: “Here is a rule [of life] that I, together with my Blessed Mother, as                sweet, kind, and loving superiors, give you:                       At this point, the lectio divina is brought to the next moment, that of action, proposed                by Jesus himself:                       6. do not grow weary of praying to the Lord of the harvest, who is I, and (pray to) my                Father in my Name and (to) my Most Holy Mother, so that we may soon send numerous and                holy  laborers  to  the  mystical  harvest.  The  Evangelical  Rogation,  raised  personally  and                communally to the Lord of the harvest, is the apostolic activity of absolute priority, which                defines  and  specifies  the  Rogationist.  It  is  the  rule  that  governs  the  life  of  one  who  is                consecrated to the Rogate, who cannot and must not grow weary of praying: his life becomes                prayer. Jesus from the tabernacle wraps up the charismatic message by moving from action (do                not grow weary of praying) to personal commitment:                        7. … and you strive to become such for my glory and the salvation of souls, in whatever                condition of this religious life I will assign you (AR p. 1012). That symbolic pronoun such                assumes great significance because it sums up all the characteristics that define the Rogationist                at  the  highest  level,  just  as  Father  Hannibal  desires  in  asking  the  Lord  of  the  harvest  for                omnipotent vocations, most chosen souls, priests with zeal and charity […] new most chosen                apostles  and  souls  of  the  highest  level  of  sanctity  (AR,  pp.  665-666;  Declarations  and                Promises, XXI). Moreover, holiness:                                                                96","a) is the conditio sine qua non in order to give glory to God and obtain the salvation of                souls;                       b) makes the Evangelical Rogation acceptable to the Lord of the harvest (cf. below, in                24).                        If the Eucharist is the origin and the perennial spring of the life of those consecrated to                the Rogate, the Rogationists have to find in it the existential form, which rules over all the                demands of their being and the energy of their doing, at every moment and movement of their                activities.                       Aware of this reality, the Founder left various statements that we could define as articles                of the “Eucharistic creed”. Let us read one among the most significant:                       He [Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament] must always be, for us and for those who will come                after us, in all our houses, our center, our life, our existence, our hope, our perseverance, our                all  (Regolamento  della  Congregazione  delle  Figlie  del  Divino  Zelo  del  Cuore  di  Gesù,                December 15, 1920).                        Living the Eucharist must constitute for the Rogationist an inalienable interior need, a                necessity of the spirit, a vital need. This is the essential condition to be able to represent the                Christ of the Rogate in the Church and in the world.                        Aware that the Rogate is the command of the Divine zeal of his Heart and that this zeal                devoured that divine Heart (AP, p. 115), Father Hannibal, with his charismatic originality,                takes care to place his spiritual children inside the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, a burning furnace                of charity. In the Supplica of 1895, he addressed the divine Heart and said to him:                       Most loving Heart of Jesus, our C Friend, (the title of 1895), we consecrate all of                ourselves to you, all of this work […] place this little seed in your sweetest Heart, and from                this most loving Heart give life and existence to this Pious Work of your poor, ad maiorem                consolationem Cordis tui, for the greater consolation of your Heart (Scritti, vol. 4, p. 37; AP,                p. 266).                                                                                                   97","28. Rogationist apostles of the Rogate                         The second dimension of the fourth vow of the Rogationists prescribes, as its purpose                and obligation, to spread this spirit of prayer everywhere and to promote vocations (diffusive-                promotional dimension). The Superior General, Fr. Giorgio Nalin, in the presentation of the                final document of the X General Chapter, writes as follows:                           The  X  General  Chapter,  celebrated  during  the  year  of  grace  of  the                       canonization  of  the  Founder,  has  oriented  the  course  of  our  religious  family                       towards  the  relaunching  of  its  charismatic  mission  at  the  start  of  the  third                                   28                       millennium.                       The  Rogate,  an  original  and  extraordinary  charism  -  also  in  relation  to  the  other                founding charisms - was given by the Spirit to our holy Founder to transmit it, in its objectivity,                to all members of the Mystical Body of Christ. All the faithful, whatever their state of life in                the Church (laity, religious, clergymen), must pray to the Lord of the harvest to send laborers                to his harvest, a duty that responds to the first and essential dimension of the fourth vow of the                Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal: “Rogate”.                  28.1. Father Hannibal's teaching                        Our  Founder,  in  the  letter  addressed  to  Father  Jordan,  founder  of  the  Salvatorians,                writes:                                This, more than a singular, unique mission, is still only in its beginnings.                       It must be extended and propagated because it cannot achieve the good effects it                       tends to if it is not spread. Therefore, it is necessary to organize in the field of the                       Institutes: a continuous, intelligent, active, fervent, industrious work, to spread                       this spirit of prayer throughout the world, to attract the attention of the peoples,                       of the faithful, of all the religious houses, of all the pious souls, and the secular                       clergy on this great command of Jesus Christ, so clear in the two Gospels, and yet                       so much hidden until now (MB III, p. 481-482).                       In the same letter he prophetically adds:                                How  many  things  remain  to  be  done  for  such  a  timely  and  fruitful                       promotion […]? It would be necessary to form a magazine that would broaden                       knowledge  about  it,  constitute  centers  in  various  cities  to  establish  the  Pious                       Union, expand the Sacred Alliance to the two clergies, make new translations of                       the prayers, and spread them, and many other things quas continui in sinu meo,                       which I hold in my bosom! (MB III, p. 483).                       Father Tusino testifies that the heart of the Father overflowed with love and zeal for the                diffusion of the divine command, and he was never satisfied (AP, p. 114).                       Ever attentive to the will of God and always docile to the enlightenment of the Spirit,                our Founder was aware of having been called, consecrated, and sent to be an apostle of the                Rogate.  Like  Paul,  he  claimed  the  divine  origin  of  his  vocation  and  the  corresponding                apostolate: by command of God (1 Tim 1:1), or by the will of God (Col 1:1). Therefore, he felt                     Apostles of the Rogate. The mission of the Rogationists at the beginning of the third millennium, Document of                28                the X General Chapter, Rome, 2004.                                                              98","the diffusion of the Rogate was an obligation imposed by God himself. We can imagine that                Father Hannibal, burning with the irrepressible desire to spread the Rogate, in reflecting on his                mission in the Church, paraphrased Saint Paul several times, saying to himself: Woe to me, if I                did not preach the Rogate!                        And  with  the  teaching  and  testimony,  he  sought  to  transmit  to  his  disciples  this                charismatic responsibility.                                Every Rogationist of the Heart of Jesus will do the best to make known this                       divine command, to spread this beneficial devotion (AR, p. 467).                               These two communities are two centers or hearths, where the sacred fire                       of  that divine Word  - Rogate -  is  kept  alive and from  where pious promotion                       (=propaganda) starts and spreads (Letters, vol. 1, p. 396).                                The perfection of the fourth vow not only commits them to this unceasing                       prayer but also obliges them to spread its spirit everywhere (PPA 1901).                               Always keep the spirit of the Evangelical Prayer of the Heart of Jesus alive                       and burning, and spread it with all possible means (AR, p. 378).                        In  all  his  writings,  the  words  “incessant”,  “universal”,  “unanimous”  resonate  with                expressions that change, like a physiological repetitiveness, analogous to the breath of the                living man. During the solemn liturgy of the canonization on May 16, 2004, John Paul II                delivered the homily in which he reminds the Rogationists of the testament left by the holy                Founder: He left to the Rogationist Fathers and the Daughters of Divine Zeal the task to do                their utmost with all their strength  so that prayer for  vocations  would  be \"unceasing and                universal\".                  28.2. Father Hannibal, Apostle of the Rogate                               I will unceasingly dedicate all my days and all my actions to this Prayer,                       also known as the Evangelical Rogation of  the  Most  Sacred  Heart  of  Jesus.  I                       will have a great solicitude and zeal, according to the norms of our  Constitutions,                       so that this divine  command of Our Lord Jesus Christ, so little appreciated until                       now, would be known and fulfilled everywhere; so that in all the world, all the                       priests, secular and religious, all the Prelates of Holy Church up to the Supreme                       Pontiff,  all  the  virgins  consecrated to  Jesus,  all  pious  souls,  all  clerics  and                       seminarians, all  the  poor  and  children, all, all will pray the Almighty  God to                       send, without delay, innumerable and perfect laborers, either men or women, in                       the Priesthood and the Lay state, for the sanctification and salvation of all souls,                       not even one left out. I will be ready, with the Lord’s help, to make any sacrifice,                       even by giving my blood and my life, so that this Rogation would become universal                       (Declarations and Promises, XXI).                       This citation, in which the all-inclusive adjective “all” is repeated eleven times, is a                declaration-testament (clearly autobiographical) that must be signed by his disciples. For his                part, our Founder put into practice all his gifts, his qualities, his culture, his zeal, so that the                Evangelical Prayer would become a universal prayer, a unanimous and universal prayer of the                Church.                        Of the Church, that is, of all the people of God. This is the reason for the initiatives                promoted  by  him,  both  the  Sacred  Priestly  Alliance  and  the  Pious  Union  of  Evangelical                Rogation, which progressed with outstanding results.                                                                99","Personally, despite being almost alone, restricted by a thousand limitations, and without                the  wealth  of  the  means  of  today’s  technology,  Father  Hannibal  was  surprisingly  rich  in                initiatives to spread the Rogate. From the early years of his youth, with overwhelming and                unstoppable enthusiasm, he began his charismatic apostolate.                        1. a young man of twenty-four years, on March 13, 1875, he published the first article                (= i.e., about the Rogate) in “The Catholic Word”, a weekly newspaper of the archdiocese of                Messina.                        2.  In  1885,  he  published  in  Italian,  French,  English,  Polish,  Spanish,  a  booklet                containing a long prayer to obtain good laborers.                        3.  To  spread  the  Lord's  command  throughout  the  world  (even  after  his  death),  he                institutionalized the Rogate with the foundation of two religious Institutes: the Daughters of                Divine Zeal and the Rogationists.                        4. In 1887, he instituted the Sacred Priestly Alliance to unite cardinals, bishops, priests,                religious in this prayer.                        5. In 1900, he established the Pious Union of  Evangelical Rogation [now UPV) to                spread this prayer among the faithful of all the local Churches.                       6. He was present at Eucharistic Congresses with his unfailing interventions. Unable to                participate in Rome in 1922, he wrote a booklet, The Great Word, distributed in thousands of                copies by the Youth of Jesus Militia.                       7. In 1907, he launched the magazine “God and Neighbor” to spread the Evangelical                Prayer and the devotion to the “Bread of Saint Anthony”, reaching a circulation of more than                700,000 copies.                        8. He endeavored a lot to insert into the Litanies of the Saints the verse: Ut dignos ac                sanctos operarios in messem tuam copiose mittere digneris, Te rogamus, audi nos. That you                may send many holy laborers into your harvest. We ask you, hear our prayer. He involved the                participants in the Eucharistic congresses, cardinals, bishops, superiors of religious orders, to                promote  this  petition  in  the  Congregation  of  Rites,  unfortunately,  with  negative  results.                However, during the audience of July 11, 1909, he obtained such grace directly from Pius X,                though limited only to the Institutes of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                        9.  In  addition,  he  instituted  the  Sacred  Alliance  of  Sympathizers  (=  Zelatrice),  the                Sacred Alliance of Co-Founders and Co-Foundresses; and finally, the Heavenly Alliance.                       One of the censors of his writings stated:                               He was so concerned with the need of the Church to have numerous and                       worthy laborers and the effectiveness of the evangelical remedy to obtain them so                       much so that, to realize it, he moved, so to say, heaven and earth. This [the Rogate]                       was the reason for his life, the dominant note of his writings, the characteristic of                       his work (PS, Report of Father Valentino Macca).                        In 1923, Father Hannibal purchased a rotary machine, which, at that time, represented                the pinnacle of technology in the field of the press, for the printing of the magazine “God and                the Neighbor”. Today, for the diffusion of the Rogate, he would surely have provided his                communities with more up-to-date media instruments and means. He would have promoted the                systematic training of religious endowed with capacities for better management of those means.                We can legitimately speculate all these, based on what he wrote to Father Jordan: It is necessary                to organize in the field of the Institutes: continuous, intelligent, active, fervent, diligent work,                to spread this spirit of prayer throughout the world.                                                               100","But why was our Founder so fervently “obstinate” in it?                        The  reason  is  found  in  the  purest  faith  of  Father  Hannibal  who,  docile  to  the                enlightenment of the Spirit, thoroughly believed in the soteriological dimension of the Rogate,                as understood from the following citations:                                That word of Jesus Christ is a command with supreme importance, indeed                       an infallible resource for the salvation of the Church and society (AP, p. 115).                                The Rogate contains the secret of all good works and the salvation of all                       souls.                                In the propagation of this divine prayer, Satan sees the beginning of the                       downfall of his kingdom (Circular letter to the congregants, October 28, 1911).                       On July 11, 1909, he wrote to Pope Pius X: I have dedicated myself since my youth to                this holy Word: Rogate ... In the end, he left us an astounding declaration that must be accepted                and signed by his disciples: I will be ready, with the Lord’s help, to make any sacrifice, even                by giving my blood and my life, so that this “Rogation” would become universal (Declarations                and Promises, XXI).                        In his homily for the beatification (October 7, 1990), John Paul II stated: The multitude                of people not yet reached by the Gospel and the insufficient number of evangelizers were the                torment of his heart as apostle and priest.                       This statement of John Paul II sketches the icon of Saint Hannibal urged and stirred up                by the love of Christ for souls; the love poured out by the Spirit in the heart of the Founder                with the gift of the Rogate, for which he was restless, and with all the means, he tried to                announce to the people of God the Evangelical Prayer, the secret of all good works and the                salvation of all souls.                             I will consider the Church of Jesus Christ as the vast field covered with the                       harvest, namely the people of the world…  I will always consider how the great                       part of this harvest perishes for lack of laborers… I will feel my heart pierced by                       so much harm affecting particularly the  tender harvest, which is the  emerging                       generations. I  will immerse myself in  the intimate sorrows of  the  Most Sacred                       Heart of Jesus for such continuous and secular misery, reminding myself of the                       most holy Word  of Jesus Christ:  Rogate… I will hold that… no remedy can be                       more efficacious and sovereign than this command given to us by our Lord Jesus                       Christ (Declarations and Promises, XXI).                   28.3. The Church’s Response                       This charismatic dynamism was like a powerful trumpet blast, which brought God's                people to their knees. John Paul II, in the homily delivered on the day, he proclaimed the                holiness of Father Hannibal (May 16, 2004), affirmed: From this providential intuition, a great                movement of prayer for vocations rose up within the Church                        The Supreme Pontiffs:                       1.  Pius  X  warmly  welcomes  the  fact  that  many  personalities  of  the  ecclesiastical                       hierarchy responded to the initiative of the Founder, and he also unites his prayer with                       that of so many associates (cf. MB III, p. 314).                       2.  Benedict  XV,  who  received  our  Founder  in  two  private  audiences  and  declared                       himself the first Rogationist.                                                               101","3. Pius XI defined the Pious Union as the work of works (= the greatest work).                        4. Pius XII instituted in 1941 the Pontifical work for priestly vocations.                       5. The Vatican Council II, in OT 2, recalling the responsibility of the bishops, priests,                       and all the faithful, writes:                               The duty of fostering vocations pertains to the whole Christian community                       […] All priests especially are to manifest an apostolic zeal in fostering vocations                       […]. Bishops, on the other hand, are to encourage their flock to promote vocations                       and should be concerned with coordinating all forces in a united effort to this end                       […] The sacred synod commends first of all the traditional means of common                       efforts, such as urgent prayer…                       It will be the Holy Father Paul VI who would make the evangelical Prayer universal,                through the institution (1964) of the World Day of Prayer for Vocations, which is celebrated                every year on the Fourth Sunday of Easter, solicited and remembered by an appealing message                to pray as commanded by Jesus Christ. From the message of 1967, we can pick out some                expressions that synthesize and echo the thought of the Founder:                                … But in the meantime, all, yes, all the members of the people of God, heed                       our invitation and do at least one thing, do what Christ Himself commanded:                       “Pray the Lord of the harvest to send laborers to his harvest.” It is obvious that                       prayer is an essential part of this divine “economy” (Paul VI, WDPV, March 5,                       1967).                               Is not this the first recommendation - the only one it seems - that the Lord                       left  to  his  disciples  in  such  a  circumstance? (Paul  VI,  World  Congress  on                       Vocations, May 10, 1971).                       Paul VI is confident that the problem of the crisis of vocations finds its solution in the                                                                            29                prayer commanded by Christ and in the witness of the priests.                       In the apostolic letter Summi Dei Verbum of November 4, 1963, the same Pontiff wrote:                                The  first  duty,  then,  that  devolves  on  all  Christians  regarding  priestly                       vocations is that of prayer, according to the precept of the Lord: “The harvest is                   29  The whole Church is examining this problem which, especially in certain regions, is exceptionally serious.                [...] the  first  urgency  is  undoubtedly  to  sensitize  the  Christian  people,  the  families,  to  the  grandeur  and  the                necessity  of  these  vocations,  to  the  esteem  of  the  specific  priesthood,  demanded  by  the  blossoming  of  the                \"baptismal priesthood\" of the laity themselves. At the same time, an ardent prayer will be aroused for these                vocations, \"so that the Lord of the harvest may send laborers into his harvest\" (cf. Mt 9:38 ). Is not this the first                recommendation - the only one it seems - that the Lord left to his disciples in such a circumstance? The Holy                Spirit will never refuse to a Christian people, generous and assiduous in such prayer, the pastors of which they                really need: this must be a deep conviction for us. […] The same Holy Spirit compels in us the duty to put to work                all  the  pastoral  resources  capable  of  awakening  young  people  to  the  priestly  vocation,  of  helping  them  to                recognize the call of the Lord and the needs of the Church, […]                   Finally, [...] is it not up to the priests themselves to make the priesthood shine with a light which makes it                desirable? Where the priest leads a truly evangelical life, drawing love, courage, and joy in a ministry exercised                in  deep  union  with  Christ,  this  witness  cannot  long  remain  fruitless  for  vocations. Who  does  not  see  it,                however? Any  weakening  of  the  priestly  ideal,  any  hesitation  about  it,  like  any  mediocrity  of  life  and  any                dissension within the clergy, inevitably dries up its source.                   Would this not be one of the dramas of the current crisis, which so many lay Christians are witnessing with                pain?                   But We have the firm conviction: with the help of God, with the support of so many generous priests, and with                the prayers of so many faithful and consecrated souls, this crisis will be overcome.  (Paul VI, World Congress on                Vocations, Rome May 10-14, 1971)                                                              102","great, but the laborers are few. Pray, therefore, the Lord of the harvest to send                       laborers into his harvest” (Mt 9:37-38). It is clearly indicated in these words of                       our  divine  Redeemer  that  the  primary  source  of  the  priestly  vocation  is  God                       himself, in his free and merciful will.                        In the message of the World Day of Prayer for Vocations (May 2, 1971), the same Paul                VI writes:                                All the people of Christ should humbly ask God for that which God alone                       can give, praying, in keeping with the command of the Master, for the Lord of the                       harvest to send out laborers into his harvest (Mt 9:38). All the people: but first of                       all, the priests and the religious themselves, by their example, zeal, and loyalty,                       on which the whole future of the Church hangs.                       John Paul II, in the post-synodal exhortation PDV (1992), about prayer (no. 38) says:                The Church must accept every day the persuasive and demanding invitation of Jesus, who asks                to “pray to the Lord of the harvest let him send out laborers into his harvest”(Mt 9:38). While,                                                                                *                in the message for the World Day of Prayer for Vocations of 1980,  he writes that as though in                a world-wide Upper Room, in continuous prayer, together with Mary, the Mother of Jesus and                the Church, let this insistent prayer rise to heaven, to ask the Father what Christ wanted us to                ask: laborers for his harvest.                       We  can  affirm  that  the  supreme  pontiffs  accredit  with  their  supreme  authority  the                doctrine on the theological dimension and the supernatural nature of vocations, together with                the  corresponding  necessity  of  prayer  to  obtain  them.  Our  Holy  Founder  was  its  prophet,                evangelizer, and promoter with his writings and apostolic action. John Paul II declared him an                                                                                                      30                authentic forerunner and zealous Master of Modern vocation ministry (October 7, 1990).                       Currently, in vocational congresses and meetings at all levels, the prayer commanded                by Jesus is considered a priority element, essential for obtaining vocations. On a practical level,                in  almost  all  parishes,  at  different  times  and  in  different  ways,  Eucharistic  adorations  are                celebrated, and prayers are made for the same purpose.                   28.4. The Rogationists and the diffusion of the Rogate, today                                                                               **                       The final document of the X Rogationist General Chapter  (2004) deals precisely with                the mission of the Apostles of the Rogate and begins with a text taken from John Paul II’s                message, dated June 26, 2004, addressed to the Superior General, Father Giorgio Nalin, on the                occasion of the same Chapter. In this message, the Pope, at a certain point, addresses all the                Rogationists with these words:                                Dear  Rogationists,  the  Church  and  the  world  expect  of  you  renewed                       fidelity to the charism of the apostles of the \"Rogate\" that distinguishes you. Live                       the joy of your vocation, therefore, with all the passion that the Spirit kindles in                       your hearts and do not let the People of God and of all humanity be deprived of                       what the Redeemer himself asked for: \"Rogate!\".                   *  EN: The citation is from the Message of the Pope for the World Day of Vocations in 1979, not in 1980.                30  Cf. Speech to the pilgrims who attended the beatification, L’Osservatore Romano.                ** EN: The Author wrote these notes in 2010. Since then, situations have changed, particularly in the Apostolate                of the Rogate. Some works were reorganized or discontinued, while many new expressions have been initiated. It                would be good to give an update of the situation in case this book will be used as a text in formation houses, such                as the novitiate for example.                                                              103","After Father Hannibal's death, his disciples have committed themselves to the same                mission  following  their  Father  and  master.  On  January  26,  1938,  in  Trani,  the  magazine                “Rogate  ergo”  began  in  a  very  humble  way,  and  today  it  has  reached  a  high  level  of                specialization in the field of vocations and vocation ministry.                        The process of deepening and spreading the Rogate has been truly remarkable since the                General Chapter of 1968, with the institution of the General Secretariat of the Rogate in Rome,                which is today the International Rogate Vocation Center.                        The Center promotes studies and research on the subject of vocation. It is active in the                field  of  religious  publications  with  an  average  of  twenty  publications  yearly  and  three                magazines (“Rogate ergo”, “Mondo Voc”, “Cenacoli Voc”). Furthermore, it is working on the                prospect of creating a Higher Institute for Vocation Ministry in Rome. In Brazil, it has already                been operating in São Paulo and conducted at the Rogate Vocation Center.                       The  International  Rogate  Vocation  Center  published  the  Biblical  Dictionary  of                Vocation,  indeed  an  ambitious  endeavor,  which  was  presented  at  the  headquarters  of  the                “Vatican Radio” on October 30, 2007.                       The studies on the Rogate and the zeal for the diffusion of the prayer for vocations                signal a happy rhythm of acceleration, which proceeds with more and more enthusiasm, with                the  establishment  of  Rogate  Vocation  Centers  in  the  various  Circumscriptions  of  the                Rogationists and of the Daughters of Divine Zeal, the publication of magazines and other social                media that are carriers of our charismatic message: “Amico Rog”, “Mondo Voc”, “Rogate” in                Brazil, “Vocations and Prayer” in the USA, “Rogate Ergo Asia” (in the Philippines), CDs,                videotapes, audiotapes, etc.                        In this context, the Rogate Center of Spirituality in Morlupo (Rome), the venue for                ongoing  formation  and  place  of  animation  for  the  Rogationist  laity,  assumes  particular                importance. The Center, which also welcomes groups of religious, priests, and laity for various                spiritual meetings, became a place of diffusion of the evangelical Rogation.                       Every missionary presence of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal in                various nations on the five continents constitutes a center of diffusion.                        The Rogationists, who run schools and animate parishes, characterize their teaching and                apostolate, promoting catechesis and prayer meetings, and establishing lay associations, which                express in their lives and activities the charism of the Rogate.                       In  the  charismatic  dynamism  carried  out  by  the  Rogationists  and  the  Daughters  of                Divine Zeal, the document Apostles of the Rogate launches an appeal to all communities: All                Rogationist communities are called to a more significant insertion in diocesan programs with                the specific richness of our charism (AR, 39).                       The Congregation is currently studying the commitment to relaunching the Rogationist                Priestly Alliance in effective operational terms.                       We can affirm that the Rogate is at the heart of the two religious Congregations founded                by Father Hannibal. In fact, this charismatic dimension is present:                        1. in all the final documents of the General Chapters of the two Congregations;                       2. in the circular letters of the Superiors General;                                                                      104","3. in the magazines published by the General Postulation: “Padre Annibale oggi” and                                *                       “ADIF”.                       4.  in  the  publications  promoted  by  the  International  Center:  “Studi  Rogazionisti”,                       “Quaderni di  Studi Rogazionisti”, “In cammino”, in  the magazines of the vocation                       centers of Circumscription, in the periodic publications of the (Anthonian) benefactors                       offices of the two Congregations;                        5. furthermore, many Rogationists and Daughters of Divine Zeal choose research topics                       that  are  related  to  the  charismatic  proprium  for  their  licentiate  and  doctoral                       dissertations;                        6. On the first centenary of the Pious Union of the Evangelical Rogation of the Heart of                Jesus (December 8-10, 2000), a Congress of studies on the Union of Prayer for Vocations was                held at the Rogate Spirituality Center in Morlupo (Rome). Following the indications of that                Congress, the Superior General, Fr. Giorgio Nalin, promulgated with a letter dated February                13, 2003, an ad experimentum project for the organization and relaunch of the Union of Prayer                for Vocations.                       For the best effectiveness of the apostolate of the diffusion of the Rogate, two conditions                are  necessary  and  essential:  Holiness  and  fraternal  communion,  whose  theological,                Christological, and charismatic reasons we have already discussed above, in chap. 24.                        Here,  we  only  want  to  recall  what  has  been  affirmed  in  the  apostolic  exhortation                Christifideles Laici and the document of the X General Chapter (2004), Apostles of the Rogate.                               Communion and mission are profoundly connected, they interpenetrate                       and mutually imply each other, to the point that communion represents both the                       source and the fruit of mission: communion gives rise to mission, and mission is                       accomplished in communion. It is always the one and the same Spirit who calls                       together and unifies the Church and sends her to preach the Gospel \"to the ends                       of the earth\" (Acts 1:8) (CFL 32).                               The Rogate, source of communion in the community, becomes the inspiring                       force of the apostolate. Consecrated and sent for the work of God, with the witness                       of life and with the proper apostolate of the Rogate, we express our mission by                       \"zealously endeavor for [= zelare] the spirit of prayer for vocations and work for                       their promotion\" (AdR 26).                  28.5. The Missionaries of the Rogate                        If our specific mission, at the ecclesial level, is the second dimension of the fourth vow,                i.e.,  to  propagate  the  spirit  of  the  prayer  commanded  by  Jesus,  I  believe  that  the  current                apostolate, through publications in the press and other media, is not enough. Our charismatic                mission to spread the Rogate should reach the horizons envisioned by the Founder, who burned                with the desire to see the evangelical Rogation become unceasing, unanimous, and universal                within the Church. To achieve this goal, I believe that it is necessary to institute the figure and                                                     *                role of the missionaries of the Rogate,  who should contact bishops (on the reasons, cf. above,                  * EN: The current title of the magazine is Sant’Annibale.                 * EN: This proposal of the Author should not be confused with the consecrated lay women who takes the same                name in English (Missionaries of the Rogate) but are referred to as Missionarie Rogazioniste in Italian.

They will organize meetings with priests and seminarians of the dioceses, reach out to                parishes, religious communities, schools, hospitals, families, with particular attention to the                sick, adolescents, and young people.                        Consequently, before providing suitable personnel for charitable Works, parishes, and                others activities, the competent superior of Circumscriptions should set apart, for the work of                diffusion of the Evangelical Rogation, religious of interior spirit, adequately prepared for this                specific apostolate, intelligent, gifted, creative, who, following the example of our Founder,                can “invent” effective initiatives to successfully spread the Union of Prayer for Vocations and                the Union of the Sacred Allies of the Rogate. Naturally, the missionaries of the Rogate will be                exclusively dedicated to their mission; therefore, there will not have other assignments either                within or outside the community.                        Let us not forget that the Rogationists are the only ones in the Church, to whom the                Spirit entrusted the Rogate, Word and Command of supreme importance for the glory of God                and the salvation of souls.                                                                      seems to envision them as those Rogationist religious who are totally dedicated to the spreading of the Rogate,                the second dimension of the charism, through the UPV and PUPV.                                                               106","31                           29. Union of the Sacred Allies of the Rogate (U.S.A.R)                        The reason behind this topic is also the need and urgency that the Congregation of the                Rogationists feels as a serious duty to relaunch the USAR in the Church today.                       The document of the X General Chapter (2004) Apostles of the Rogate, no. 36 reads:                The Rogationist Priestly Alliance, considering its historical and charismatic relevance in the                present situations, requires a study in view of a timely relaunch.                       The General Government organized at the Rogate Spirituality Center in Morlupo on                July 5, 2007, a study seminar on the theme Rogationist Priestly Alliance: historical research                and perspectives for the future. The Acts were published by the Center for Rogationist Studies,                in the formation journal In Cammino, special edition, Morlupo, July 5, 2007.                        Father Antonio Fiorenza concludes the presentation of the Acts with these words:                               The day of study, however, did not untie all the “knots” for a new and                       clear  proposal  in  the  contents  that  are  pastorally  significant  today.  […]                       Therefore, we need another session of in-depth study, based on what emerged                       from the previous one, to clarify what is still unclear, not for an initiative of a                       relaunch.                        The  General  and  Provincial  Chapters,  as  well  as  the  current  General  Government,                expressed interest in an effective relaunch of this initiative of the Holy Founder. This gives us                the reason to hope that, with appropriate adaptation to the culture and sensibility of the various                geographical areas, the USAR can find its due space and acceptance, in a historical moment,                when  we  are  witnessing  an  extraordinary  flourishing  of  associations,  unions,  ecclesial                movements at all levels. From the evangelical, charismatic, theological, and ecclesial point of                view, the USAR is of fundamental importance for the coming of the Kingdom.                       Furthermore,  we  should  also  highlight  the  frequent  references  to  the  evangelical                passages of the Rogate, which the Holy Father Benedict XVI makes in his speeches, especially                when addressing priests and religious. Everyone is also aware of the concerns and proposals of                the Prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy, Card. Claudio Hummes, intended for a better                and qualified presence and apostolic action of the clergy.                     31 EN: The Author uses the term Union of Sacred Allies of the Rogate to refer to the “Sacred Alliance” (Sacra                Alleanza) of prayer for vocations that St. Hannibal founded for bishops and priests in 1897. It is currently called                Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations (PUPV) after the relaunch proposed by the X General Chapter of 2004.                 Statute of the Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations.                   On the occasion of the Year of Priests proclaimed by Benedict XVI with letter dated June 16, 2009, the                Superior General, Father Giorgio Nalin, on November 1, 2009, sent the Family of the Rogate the circular letter                with the title Priests according to the Heart of Christ, in which he writes in no. 6: “Moved by the zeal of the                Rogationist vocation, we feel driven, during this year, to revive our charism that sees us, above all, engaged in                prayer to the Lord of the harvest for the gift of holy priests and in the active diffusion of the spirit of this prayer.                Precisely in carrying out the task of spreading the Rogate of Christ in the Church, I believe that it is extremely                opportune to propose this year, as I said in the beginning, the relaunching of the Rogationist Priestly Alliance,                through the publication of a renewed and updated Statute “ad experimentum”, which, to better underline its                affinity with the Union of Prayer for Vocations, it is now called the \"Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations\".                   See Appendix II for the most recent By-Laws (2014) approved by the then Superior  General Fr. Angelo                Mezzari.                                                               107","29.1. The USAR is a divine revelation                        The Founder states this especially in the Preface to the Precious Adhesions of 1919.                The term revelation appears three times, with reference to the Gospel verses. This shows that                the Lord’s command is not only a revelation but also the resource-idea.                                1. We call it an evangelical revelation, a divine idea (understating it would                                                                                              *                       not be humility) which averted and accompanied the poor Priest-starter  in the                       arduous undertaking.                               2. These two passages from the Holy Gospels form a “great revelation.”                                3. I said that a happy resource-idea flashed in the mind of the Starter of                       the Pious Work, and it is the “daughter of the Evangelical Revelation”, that is, of                       the spirit that had formed the daily prayer or rogation to obtain the good laborers                       for the Holy Church.                        Among the Founder's initiatives, the resource-idea to which he gave the name of the                Sacred Alliance occupies one of the first places on the hierarchy of charismatic values; in fact,                it is the daughter of a great Word of the Gospel, of the evangelical revelation, of the Rogate.                        Precisely because it is “daughter” of the Rogate, it is valid for us to deduce that the                Sacred Alliance is also of the same nature as the “mother”, that is, an evangelical revelation,                an initiative that is willed, brought about, and dictated by the Holy Spirit to Father Hannibal                and,  therefore,  a  reality  that  permeates  all  the  dimensions  of  our  charism,  both  from  the                ideological or practical point of view.                        It seems to me that this is precisely the thought of the Founder, as understood from his                writings.                        In the circular letter that the Founder sent to the Congregants on October 28, 1911 (=                LC: Letter to the Congregants), we read: We should never neglect to always keep in mind that                the immense good of these three “Sacred Alliances” has been granted to us by the Infinite                Divine Goodness because of His Infinite Mercy and his infinite love.                                                                              **                       Father Hannibal affirms that the three Sacred Alliances  are a gift that comes down                from above, a gesture of the infinite mercy of God. They are not the fruit of his intelligence.                And he continues making a historical and wise analysis of the motivations.                                The most gracious Heart of Jesus himself has placed us in the condition of                       being able to avail of such a great benefit, by having given us that sublime Word                       of  the  Divine  Zeal  of  his  Heart:  “Rogate  ergo  Dominum  messis,  ut  mittat                       operarios  in  messem  suam”  and  having  supplied  us  his  most  holy  grace  to                       dedicate ourselves to the Works of Christian Charity and assistance, gathering                       the abandoned little orphans for whom his beloved Heart longs so much, and                       helping the poor and the afflicted ones who are the constant object of the tender                       compassion and eternal Love of his sweetest Heart (LC).                       The Founder is sure that the Heart of Jesus himself, has placed him in the conditions to                  *  EN: St. Hannibal has always considered Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament as the true, immediate, and effective                Founder of the Congregations of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal. Instead, he refers to himself                as the Priest-starter.                **  EN: The three Sacred Alliances were implicitly enumerated above in chapter 28.2, and the topic is further                developed below, in chapter 29.8 and 29.10.                                                                108","receive the treasure of the Sacred Alliances because he gave him the grace of the ‘great Word”.                Having given him the Rogate, he could not help but also give him the Sacred Alliances, which                represent  a  logical  and  necessary  outcome  for  the  propagation  of  the  Rogate.  A  second                motivation lies in the fact that, together with the Rogate, he received the understanding of the                objective of this gift of the Spirit: that of the service of charity for the little ones and the poor.                               But  what  have  we  done  ourselves  to  deserve  these  three  “Sacred                       Alliances”?  We  placed  before  you  our  unworthiness  and  misery  (and  mine,                       especially),  which  attracted  toward  us  the  compassionate  gaze  of  the  most                       merciful Jesus Christ our Lord and that of his most merciful Divine Mother (LC).                        The Founder was fully aware of his unworthiness, of his “nothingness”, which could                not utterly be at the origin of the resource-idea. At the same time, he recognizes that God turns                his gaze towards the humble to do “great things”. And the association he makes with the gaze                of his most compassionate Mother is significant, either because, in all the dynamism of the                Spirit who has entrusted to him the charism, the Blessed Virgin Immaculate is always present,                or because of a special echo to the words of Mary: He has looked on the lowliness of his                Servant.                               Someway, even the world and the devil are occasions to merit for such a                       unique good. The world presents itself in the form of neglect, abandonment, and                       criticism on the strenuous efforts which we exerted for  many years  to  save the                       orphans and the poor, but nothing seemed to come to fruition. The world of the rich                       (apart from some exceptions) criticized and abandoned us, but this made the most                       loving Jesus be moved with so much pity on us and prepared for us the great gift of                       the three Sacred Alliances.                               The  infernal  enemy  also  drew  so  much  Mercy  to  our  favor,  because  he                       realized that we are paying attention to that great and divine word: “Rogate ergo                       Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam”, knowing that this most holy                       cause that contains the secret of the destruction of his kingdom, is united with the                       spiritual and temporal Charity of the neighbor, through which souls are snatched                       away from him. He is opposed to it and will continue to fight against this least Work                       with these two essential aims that rose in miseries and poverty, and almost from                       nothing, as it happens in the Works of God. Against this Work, he has not ceased                       and will not cease to break through its defenses (LC).                       The bitter vicissitudes and hellish struggles unleashed by the world and by Satan, who                wanted to destroy the Work of Father Hannibal since its birth, simply represent the “pains of                childbirth” which would bring the USAR to birth. Better still, they are the historical mediations                which the Holy Spirit used to make known to the Founder the whole truth of the exceptional                charism. Therefore, the great gift of the three Sacred Alliances, which he received from the                most loving Jesus, in a certain way, constitute as means to annihilate the diabolical fury of                Satan.                               The severe difficulties in which for seventeen years this “Pious Work of                       the Interests of the Heart of Jesus” found itself so oppressed, so anguished, so                       persecuted,  so  troubled,  were  the  occasional  reasons  which  made  it  seemed                       humanly impossible for such great good to be able to form and progress (LC).                                Amid the struggles that pressed hard from all sides, the Pious Work had                       many times reached the extremes. It seemed it had dissolved. […] The present                       becomes increasingly difficult, intricate, discouraging. (PPA 1901 and 1904).                                                               109","In all editions of the PPA, Father Hannibal mentions the tribulations, persecutions, and                terrible internal and external struggles experienced in 1897 (the year of the institution of the                Sacred Alliance), up to the point of fearing the end of the nascent Works.                        At  this  point,  the  Spirit  of  God  intervenes  with  the  appropriate  inspiration  of  the                resource-idea, to overcome obstacles and problems which are humanly impossible to solve:                               And  behold,  a  beautiful  idea,  which  we  would  call  a  resource-idea,                       suddenly flashed in the mind of the Priest-Starter: which, nevertheless, was itself                       the daughter of an even more excellent idea: the Word of the Gospel (PPA 1901                       and 1904).                                And our Supreme Good Jesus Christ our Lord, wanted to give us a remedy,                       and continuous help for the past, the present, and the future, so that the enemy                       would not prevail (as long as we are faithful to the Lord, as we always hope in                       Divine Grace, provided that there is our goodwill) and mercifully gave us the                       three “Sacred Alliances” which for us have been a source of Grace, help, Mercy,                       and Divine Providence, and a fortress of defense against the infernal enemy (LC).                       We limit ourselves to emphasizing the present-past-future. This time horizon justifies                the certainty that USAR is a constitutive initiative of our charism, which must be relaunched                in the most appropriate ways today.                        Father Hannibal says about USAR: Considering this admirable spiritual treasure, we                feel impelled to use all means not to lose it, always to keep it intact, to enhance it (PPA 1919).                If anyone has doubts about the opportunity to relaunch it or not, put before them these precise,                authoritative, and unequivocal statements of the Founder.                        Let us conclude this section with a further attestation of Father Hannibal that reiterates                the conviction that it is of divine inspiration, through the effects, that he obtained by USAR.                                The extremely beneficial effects that followed after the expansion of many                       spiritual benefices of the Holy Church, in favor of this small seed, were so many                       that  it  may  well  be  supposed  that  the  thought  of  invoking  this  supreme                       collaboration of prayers and blessings for the Pious Work and its components,                       more than just a simple idea, was a true inspiration from Heaven (PPA 1919).                  29.2. What works does Father Hannibal want to save?                       Before considering the nature and purposes of USAR, it is appropriate to ask ourselves:                                                                                                     32                which of his works does the Founder intends to save with the request of the four favors?                       In  the  dramatic  events  that  threatened  his  Works,  Father  Hannibal  conceived  the                resource-idea and, with the deep spirit of faith and humility, launched an SOS for the salvation                of his Works to those who knew the works of the Lord better than others: the bishops, priests,                      st                32  1 . That once a year, and without any obligation of conscience, they intend to apply the special fruit of a Holy                Mass […].                    nd                   2 . That in the daily celebration of Holy Mass with a habitual virtual intention, in the elevation of the Sacred                Species, they intend to offer this Pious Work to the Most Holy Heart of Jesus ...                   3 . That, in imparting the Holy Blessing at the end of the Mass or in blessing their own dioceses, they intend                    rd                to bless the Pious Work […].                    th                   4 . That they intend to unite their intention to that of all the components of the Pious Work in the daily prayers                that are raised in it to obtain from the Divine Mercy the chosen Ministers of the Lord (PPA 1919).                                                               110","religious.                        He  had  founded  orphanages  and,  for  their  direction,  after  failed  attempts  with  the                Daughters of Charity, with the Daughters of Saint Anne, and the Bocconist Sisters of Palermo,                he decided - not without divine inspiration - to found his religious Institutes: the Daughters of                Divine Zeal and the Rogationists.                       I believe that through the Sacred Alliance, Father Hannibal did not intend to save, at                least directly, neither the Work of Charities, nor the two religious Congregations, but, rather,                the Rogate. This seems to me the thought of the Founder, as he reveals in the PPA of 1901: But                the word of the Gospel: Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam,                incessantly worried my thoughts, from the very beginnings of this Pious Work.                       The Rogate, and only the Rogate, was the “fixed-idea,” which continuously occupied                and worried his mind. His whole self and everything in him was for the Rogate. At the summit                and in the center was the Rogate. Everything revolved around the Rogate; the sovereign means                that divine providence had offered him to satisfy his ardent desire to knock down the walls that                enclosed the Avignone Quarter, with the few orphans and few poor, and reach the horizons of                our planet for the salvation of all.                                I thought: what are these few orphans who are saved, and these few poor                       who are evangelized, compared to the millions who get lost and lie abandoned                       like sheep without a shepherd? I looked at the limits of my meager strengths and                       the smallest extent of my capacities, and I looked for a way out. I found it wide,                       immense,  in  those  adorable  words  of  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ:  Rogate  ergo                       Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam” (PPA 1901).                                With this predominant idea, I considered this Pious Institute, not so much                       as a simple work of Charity, which has the object of saving a few orphans and                       poor,  but  as  one  that  has  an  even  bigger  and  more  extensive  purpose,  more                       directly aimed to the divine glory and the salvation of souls and for the good of                       the whole Church.                               The purpose, therefore, is that of receiving from the most holy mouth of                       Jesus  Christ  the  command  of  his  Divine  Heart  expressed  with  those  sweetest                       words: Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam, and to                       carry it out with zeal in the best possible way, ad maiorem consolationem Cordis                       Jesu (PPA 1901).                        Father  Hannibal  certainly  did  not  underestimate  the  works  of  charity  in  favor  of                abandoned orphans and the evangelization and assistance of the poor. However, he, who is the                true father of the orphans and the poor, could not forget that the divine mercy had precisely                entrusted the Rogate to the little ones and to the poor of the Avignone Quarter:                               … it pleased the Divine Mercy, who looks at the little things in heaven and                       on earth, to entrust such a great treasure to this Pious Work of the poor and                       orphans.  […]  The  Divine  Word:  “Rogate  ergo  Dominum  messis,  ut  mittat                       operarios in messem suam.” […]                                It was up to the two small religious Communities that directed the male                       and female orphanages, to take into possession this sacred heritage of the Pious                       Work  of  the  Poor  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus.  They  are  to  be  its  depositaries  and                       custodians, to form the center of this important religious tradition, to always keep                       burning and alive this hearth of zeal and prayer, and to become its propagators.                       […]                                                               111","Thus, in this Pious Work, the two small Religious Congregations have the                       fourth vow of daily prayer to obtain the good laborers for the Holy Church […]                       (PPA 1901).                        The Word and command of supreme importance, or rather, an infallible resource for                the salvation of the Church and society, contains the secret of all good works and the salvation                of  all  souls.  Father  Hannibal  could  not  allow  that  the  place  where  the  “hearth”  of  the                Evangelical Prayer is always kept alive, would be destroyed by the fury of the devil, who sees                in the prayer to obtain good laborers the beginning of the downfall of his kingdom (AP, p. 115).                               Should we allow a Work that, besides saving souls, maybe the only one in                       the Holy Church, fulfills and enforces that great divine Command: Rogate ergo                       Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam to perish? How can we not                       be confident that the Most Holy Heart of Jesus will save us? (PPA 1919).                       And he asks the Sacred Allies the four spiritual favors, not for the Works, but for the                love of that divine command (PPA 1919), so that the hearth that was lit in the Avignone Quarter                and  left  as  an  inheritance  to  his  disciples  would  never  be  extinguished.  They  would  have                fulfilled their vocation to give light and warmth to the whole Church, and the first to draw from                this  luminous  source  of  fire  had  to  be  and  must  be  precisely  the  bishops,  the  priests,  the                religious.  The  four  spiritual  favors,  therefore,  were  requested  from  the  perspective  of  the                perennial subsistence of the two Congregations, according to the charism.                                When in our endeavors, everything goes through the air, there is no other                       consolation than resignation to the Divine Will, which makes everything right,                       even  if  we  do  not  understand  it.  How  much  this  resignation  costs  can  be                       understood well by those who found themselves in such situations. But in my case,                       there was a circumstance that made this chalice even more bitter: that is, having                       to resign myself to seeing the germ of a Work consecrated for the holiest purpose                       of that heavenly Command: “Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios                       in messem suam” dispersed; having to fold up this revered banner, in which shines                       one of the most tender expressions of the Most Holy Heart of Jesus, and to which                       the salvation of souls can be connected through the shortest and surest way (PPA                       1901).                        The revered banner was already in the hands of the Rogationists and the Daughters of                Divine Zeal. The Founder - who was amazed by the fact that for Saint Ignatius would have                needed  just  a  quarter  of  an  hour  to  return  to  calm  if  he  had  seen  the  Society  he  founded                destroyed (cf. AP, p. 179) - although with great sorrow, he would, at once, resign himself to                seeing the end of his Institutes. However, he could not give himself peace to the thought that it                would be the end of the Rogate (the only object of his love on earth), of which his spiritual                children were the custodians and propagators.                       The Sacred Allies, with their adherence, were called to contribute to the salvation of the                great Rogate:                                What does it cost the Sacred Prelates of the Holy Church to grant us these                       favors? Nothing, almost nothing, nor do they assume any obligation of conscience.                       But, in addition to the spiritual advantages that we give them, they will have great                       satisfaction and great merit before God, for having helped and sustained in this                       way, a Pious Work, maybe the only one, dedicated to that divine Prayer, which                       today, we have to admit, breaks free from the pages of the two Evangelists to echo                       in the heart of the Church, to shout in the ear of all Catholic cities, of all true                                                                 112","believers and lovers of Jesus Christ, as the actual and most appropriate remedy                       needed for the growing desolation of the Holy Place!  (PPA 1919).                       Ultimately, the Founder asks the spiritual favors from the Sacred Allies: 1. not for the                salvation of his works of charity, because all similar works present in the Church have the right                to be saved; 2. not for the salvation of his religious Congregations as such, because it is the                Holy Spirit who raises all religious institutes for the same purpose, that is, the building up of                the mystical Body of Christ and the coming of his kingdom. It would have been, in a way, too                selfish a claim, inconceivable in our holy Founder, who wants to save the work of the interests                of the Heart of Jesus, the work of Works (= the greatest of works). He wants to save the Rogate,                which is the charism of charisms (= the greatest of charisms), as intended to obtain from the                Lord of the harvest good laborers for all dioceses of the Catholic Church, for all religious                Congregations.                               Are not the Sacred Prelates of the Holy Church also hoping, based on                       Faith, that the constant assiduous prayer made by many innocent souls, many                       poor children of Jesus Christ, many pious virgins to the Most Holy Hearts of Jesus                       and Mary, to Saint Joseph, to the Holy Apostles, would have to bear fruit for the                       benefit of their Dioceses and Seminaries? Could we admit that this Prayer would                       not have its effects? And why would our Lord Jesus Christ had so many times                       repeatedly insisted and recommended it (not only [by saying] dixit but dicebat)?                       (PPA 1919).                        By granting the four spiritual  favors, the Sacred Allies do it  for their interests, the                interests of their dioceses and their Institutes. Father Hannibal reiterated it in his letter to the                                                       *                servant of God, Fr. Francis Mary Jordan , where he sees the Rogate not only as the charism of                charisms but even prophetically sees it in an eschatological perspective. He writes, in fact, that                the Evangelical Prayer is                               a divine mission that contains within itself, as in a germ, the missions of                       all the religious Orders, somewhat of both the secular and religious Clergies, and                       it is the perfect preparation of the Apostles of the final times! My father, this                       prayer, which is cultivated and spread throughout the world, as Jesus Christ many                       times commanded - dicebat - will raise multitudes of Saints and Apostles on earth,                       because, if Jesus Christ commanded it, he would hear it! And if he revealed it                       today,  after  nineteen  centuries,  in  these  times  when  holiness  seems  extinct,  it                       means that he set it aside for that new and divine holiness that must prepare the                       world for the coming of the Supreme Judge! (MB III, p. 481).                  29.3. Without disregarding the charitable works                        The  fact  that  USAR  aims  to  save  the  Rogate  does  not,  in  any  way,  disregard  the                existence and enduring nature of the Charitable Works. Father Hannibal is sure that, by saving                the  Rogate,  the  Charitable  Works  can  also  be  saved.  In  effect,  these  are  a  legitimate  and                immediate consequence of the mission assumed with their fourth vow, and his disciples will                not be able to do without taking care of the works of charity for the benefit of their neighbors.                    ** EN: Venerable Fr. John Baptist Jordan (in religion, Francis Mary of the Cross) [1848-1918] is the founder of                the Society of the Divine Savior or the Salvatorians. He will be beatified in the Lateran Basilica in Rome on May                15, 2021.                                                              113","The  Founder  also  informs  the  Sacred  Allies  that  by  virtue  of  the  fourth  vow,  the                                                                                      *                Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal have the mission to zeal  for the diffusion of                the Rogate in the Church. This mission will be all the more perfect and effective the more his                religious will commit themselves to charitable works, whose beneficiaries will have to learn                obedience to the Lord's command. Therefore, charitable works are practically saved. And it                will be precisely the Rogate that will be the sure, ample, immense means for the expansion of                charitable works throughout the world.                                Then. the legitimate consequence of the mission assumed with the fourth                       vow is that these two Religious Congregations have to take care of Works charity                       and assistance for the benefit of their neighbors. […].                                Furthermore, the perfection of their fourth vow not only commits them to                       this unceasing prayer but also obliges them to spread the spirit everywhere, which                       is best achieved by educating orphans and catechizing the poor, teaching them                       how desirable is the most desirable of all Graces, which is the obedience to the                       command of the Most Holy Heart of Jesus, and to get them used to put it into                       practice? (PPA 1901).                  29.4. Union is the constituent element of the USAR                        The Founder defines the Sacred Alliance with these words: a union of faith, prayer, and                blessings in the most magnificent work among all works of religion, in the divine sacrifice of                the Holy Mass (Saggio di Preziose Adesioni, 1905).                                In truth, these that we call Adhesions of the Sacred Allies, are not reduced                       to the authorization of mere formality, but have so much in concrete and on the                       positive note: they are spiritual favors of great value; it is a union of faith, prayer,                       and blessings in the most magnificent work among all works of religion, in the                       divine sacrifice of the Holy Mass (Saggio di Preziose Adesioni, 1905).                       A “spiritual Alliance” without spiritual union would be a contradictio in terminis. The                Founder, first of all, invokes the Sacred Allies’ faith, a granite rock on which to build this                “union” and essential condition to be “sacred” and give value and efficacy to prayer and to the                Holy Mass itself. If faith is lacking, it is built on sand.                        The above citations and, even more, those that immediately follow, make us understand                that the Sacred Allies are such since all are spiritually united with the Rogationists and the                Daughters of Divine Zeal, in the same prayer and its propagation.                        The Founder sees the resource-idea as an immense cenacle in which the Sacred Allies,                together with the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal, form a single praying choir                and at the same time a multitude of apostles committed in the evangelization of the Rogate.                        In more than one citation, I wanted to underline and highlight the purpose of the USAR,                which is not only to pray but also to propagate the Rogate to make the evangelical prayer                universal to obtain vocations for the whole Church.                                Of  a  Sacred  Spiritual  Alliance  of  the  Episcopate  and  distinguished                       Prelates of the Holy Church and Dignitaries and Priests with the two nascent                       Institutes, to propagate such an important Prayer, and to achieve its divine effects.                       To spread increasingly such an advantageous and necessary Prayer, we have                   EN: Zelare literally means to zeal. This English edition translates it as to zealously fulfill or to zealously engage                *                in something.                                                              114","been addressing, for a few years now, the Prelates of the Holy Church, Bishops,                       Archbishops,  Cardinals,  and  Generals  of  Religious  Orders,  who  are  keenly                       interested in increasing the Catholic Priesthood. We humbly ask for nothing else                       but their participation of faith, prayer, and blessing for such an important cause.                       For this purpose, we implore out of kindness and mercy four spiritual favors:                                                                *                               1º That with the virtual intention  they may spiritually join us in daily                       prayer, lifted to the Supreme God many times a day in these Institutes, by the                       Congregants, the innocent children, and by all the poor of the Heart of Jesus, to                       obtain from the Divine Mercy the good laborers for the Holy Church (Saggio di                       Preziose Adesioni, 1905).                        The  fourth  spiritual  favor  that  Father  Hannibal  asks  of  the  Sacred  Allies  consists                precisely in this union:                               That they would intend to unite their intention to the daily prayers that all                       the components  of  the  Pious  Work raise to  obtain  from  the Divine Mercy the                       chosen Ministers of the Lord (PPA 1919).                       In the Saggio di Preziose Adesioni of 1905, we read a further entry by Father Hannibal.                He  wants  to  make  known  the  reasons  for  the  publication  of  the  Precious  Adhesions:  the                propaganda (= campaign for a cause) and the spiritual union.                                The first of these reasons refers to the vital Propaganda of the beneficial                       Prayer to obtain laborers for the Holy Church. The Bishops, Cardinals, Generals                       of Religious Orders, Priests, who grant us their spiritual favors, care about this                       vital Prayer, unite their intentions with ours, introduce it in their Dioceses and                       Seminaries, make special appreciations of that Evangelical Command.                       Once again, the Founder, in the conclusion of the PPA of 1919, repeats more explicitly                the double objective of the USAR, whose adherents contribute to keeping the flame of the                hearth  together  with  the  Rogationists  and  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal.  Knowingly,  he                underlines that this Union in faith and prayer will benefit not only his Congregations, but the                entire Church, and in particular the Allies themselves:                                The  union  of  so  many  Sacred  Allies  in  daily  prayers  to  obtain  good                       laborers for the Holy Church, will make this continuous Prayer effective and will                       draw  out  from  the  Most  Holy  Heart  of  Jesus  the  desired  and  long-awaited                       Ministers of the Sanctuary of which the Holy Church are so much in need today.                       The continuous blessings that they extend to us daily will shower the blessings of                       Heaven abundantly. Thus, the hearth in which the fire of this Prayer was lit, which                       lies almost forgotten in the Holy Gospels, will not diminish but will increase all                       the more every hour, with beneficial effects for the Holy Church and the Society                       in general, and themselves in particular. For them, we do not fail to offer an                       acceptable spiritual exchange, as mentioned above.                        The Founder is happy to be able to see that the purpose he intended to achieve with the                resource-idea has been largely achieved.                     EN: Intenzione saltem virtuale is translated into English as virtual intention. It is the intention that was once                *                made and continues to influence the act now being done, but it is not present to the person's consciousness at the                moment of performing the act. This kind of intention is sufficient for a human act to be voluntary and therefore                morally responsible.

They                       also wanted to join spiritually with this Pious Institute’s daily prayers to obtain                       good laborers for the Holy Church. To this sublime end, they promised to direct                       all their good works and practices of piety, each subscribing to an analogous                       formula that I proposed to them (PPA 1901).                               Various  Bishops  asked  me  for  the  prayer  books  to  distribute  in  their                       dioceses, and especially in religious communities. But what matters most is that                       they introduced its recitation in their Seminaries (PPA 1919).                               Indeed, it is comforting to see how this command of the Redeemer Jesus                       begins  to  be  fulfilled!  The  Bishops  take  this  important  prayer  seriously  and                       spiritually join in the daily prayers of this Pious Institute to obtain good laborers                       for the Holy Church. For this great purpose, they promised to direct all their good                       works and practices of piety (PPA 1919).                        In the prayer that the Founder asked the Sacred Allies to pray daily, he thanks the Lord                precisely for this union that had been established in the common prayer to obtain good laborers:                                O Most Precious Heart of Jesus, we present to You our humble but fervent                       supplications for all the sacred Prelates. With so much charity, they grant us                       significant spiritual advantages and intentionally join us in daily prayer to obtain                       good laborers for the Holy Church (PPA 1901).                       Indeed, it is not enough that all, bishops, priests, religious, and faithful pray with the                same prayer commanded by Jesus Christ. It is only in our unity around the altar of his sacrifice                that  the  aggregate  energy  of  all  develops  into  an  infinite  potential,  which  gives  prayer  an                enormous power of intercession.                   29.5. Who should pray and why?                       The  Sacred  Allies  are  undoubtedly  spiritual  benefactors  of  the  works  of  Father                Hannibal, in a sense previously clarified. They are likewise benefactors at the economic level,                although as a contingent and time-limited fact.                        From some passages we read in the PPA (1919), it becomes evident that, regardless of                their sustaining action in favor of the works of Father Hannibal, the bishops and clerics have                to obey the command of Jesus Christ to obtain good laborers for the Church. Exactly being                bishops, as such, their state of life demands obedience to the Rogate, and their specific vocation                makes them its messengers. The Founder asks:                               But who are those who must pray to obtain this Grace of graces (= the                       greatest grace), this Mercy of mercies (= the greatest mercy)? I think they are:                               1º The bishops of the Holy Church and all the clergy; because Jesus Christ                       precisely  said  and  repeated  several  times  (dicebat)  to  the  Apostles  and  the                       disciples:  “Messis  quidem  fine,  operaii  autem  pauci.  Rogate  ergo  Dominum                       messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam.”                               2º The Heads of the Religious Orders, because no less than the Bishops,                       they long for holy vocations for their Institutes.                                                                    116","3º All the faithful, because they all must understand that the greatest Mercy                       that the good God grants to a people, to a City, is precisely to send them chosen                       Priests […].                                4º In fourth place, the souls who are lovers of Jesus Christ and those who                       are zealous for his Glory: the Nuns, the Sisters of Congregations, the devotees                       who frequent Holy Communion, and anyone who wants to do something most                       pleasing to the most adorable Heart of Jesus who thirsts for souls! […] (PPA,                       1919).                       In  this  universal  choir,  the  bishops  and  all  the  clerics  are  the  most  interested  in                committing themselves to obey the divine command. In the rankings, Father Hannibal puts                them in the first place for two main reasons:                       1. because Jesus entrusted the command to pray to the apostles and, therefore, to their                successors;                       2. because they are shepherds of the flock.                        In a letter he wrote to the bishops to involve them in the petition to the Holy See to                grant the insertion of the Rogationist verse in the Litany of the Saints, he affirms:                               Your Excellency, I would like to point out that Jesus Christ himself gave                       this command [the Rogate] to the teaching Church rather than to the learning                       Church, because “dicebat discipulis suis,” that is, to the Apostles. Therefore, it is                       the Church that should officially pray for this purpose […]. It would be necessary,                       therefore,  that  the  Episcopate  petitions  the  Supreme  Vicar  of  Jesus  Christ                       referring to the same reason, that Jesus gave this command to the Holy teaching                       Church […]. Would that all the Bishops implement this in their Dioceses! Then                       the  prayer  commanded  by  Jesus  Christ  Our  Lord,  as  an  infallible  sovereign                       remedy  to  obtain  priests  according  to  the  Heart  of  God,  would  become  a                       “universal prayer” (Scritti, vol. 29, n. 451).                       The Founder is convinced that, if all the bishops were to commit themselves to the                evangelization of the Rogate, making the flock entrusted to them sensible and responsible, the                evangelical  Prayer  (=  rogazione  evangelica)  would  effectively  reach  the  horizons  of  the                Catholic Church. This happy prospect, which makes Father Hannibal exult for joy, will be                possible to the extent that all the bishops have the full and proper knowledge of USAR and                make it a duty of conscience, being themselves the first.                       Father Hannibal, in the PPA of 1919, still insists on this duty of bishops, given the need                to have priests for the flock entrusted to them and the formation of seminarians. A lack of                commitment would be to qualify them as unfaithful pastors!                               The efficacious resource-idea, truly blessed by God, was as follows. That                       Priest thought this way: if there are people in the world who are more interested                       in  that  Divine  Word:  “Rogate  ergo  Dominum  messis,  ut  mittat  operarios  in                       messem  suam,”  they  are  the  Bishops.  They  particularly  feel  the  need  to  have                       Priests sent by God, raised by the Holy Spirit himself. They have the Seminaries                       where they gather the clergy and strongly urge them that they become chosen                       Priests. They can never be so if all the means they use, all the fatigue, schools,                       and industries, are not joined with the unceasing Prayer commanded by Jesus                       Christ with his Divine Rogate (PPA 1919).                       He  reiterated  the  same  thought  in  the PPA,  in which  he  defines  the  bishops  living                apostle of Jesus Christ.                                                               117","... the mission of unceasing prayer to implore Good Laborers  to the Holy                       Church,  is  such  that  it  should  actively  involve  not  only  each  faithful,  each                       Christian  who  takes  the  good  of  souls  seriously,  but  in  a  particular  way  the                       Bishops, the Shepherds of the mystical Flock, to whom the souls are entrusted,                       and who are the living Apostles of Jesus Christ. I said: no person in the world                       intensely feels the need of good evangelical laborers than the Bishops themselves.                  29.6. The Eucharist, the heart of USAR                       There is no USAR if there is no Eucharist. The alliance is a fundamental concept at the                base of the theology of the Eucharist, where Christ not only realizes the covenant prefigured                and announced by the prophets, but he is the new and eternal covenant sealed with his blood                (Lk 22, 20; 1Co 11, 25), by which he introduced a new regime of grace for humanity.                        The Eucharistic celebration is the privileged place of the presence of Christ, the true                temple where Christians pray in spirit and truth and, altogether, a moment of grace with which                God, in his beloved Son, perennially constitutes us as a people of the covenant.                        In the letter mentioned above that the Founder writes to the Congregants on October                28, 1911, he affirms with determination that the idea of the USAR finds its reason in the value                and effectiveness of the Holy Mass. He points, in effect, to the time and circumstance in which                the inspiration of the resource-idea appeared in his mind, which, in an absolute and irrevocable                way, is born and has its origin in the Holy Mass and derives its meaning and validity from it.                       Being a “daughter” of the Rogate, it could not but otherwise revealed by Spirit it to the                young Eucharistic Hannibal, in a Eucharistic environment, in a Eucharistic memorial.                       In the LC, after recalling the difficulties that the work had experienced, he wrote:                                So many afflictions mark the year 1898 (Sister Mary of the Cross, Melania                       of La Salette, the great servant of God and beloved of Most Holy Virgin was then                       in the female Institute of the Holy Spirit). The Priest-starter of the [Pious Work],                       had this thought like lightning in the darkness: if we implore and obtain spiritual                       aid or support of prayers and blessings, through the offering of the great Sacrifice                       of the Holy Mass, by the Bishops and Prelates of the Holy Church, as successors                       of  the  Holy  Apostles,  then  limitations  of  the  Pious  Work  would  be  somewhat                       compensated, and draw to it so much abundance of the divine graces that would                       save it from shipwreck and brought to the port of salvation (LC).                        The subject is the Priest-starter and not Melania, as someone mistakenly read. We could                see Melania’s presence as a providential circumstance. Being the Holy Mass, the heart and soul                of the resource-idea, if Melania had had the ray amidst the darkness, we could speak of her as                the foundress of the Sacred Alliance. But, this would simply be a historical error. However, we                cannot disregard the beautiful Marian background in the Easter climate offered by the Blessed                Virgin of La Salette. In this background, Father Hannibal projects the initiative of the USAR.                The clause (Melania…was then at the female institute, etc.) is not  casual but undoubtedly                intended by the Founder, who enclosed it in brackets not to give it little importance but to make                it more evident.                               The Starter’s prevailing thought was the immense effectiveness of the Holy                       Mass  celebrated  primarily  by  such  prominent  figures  in  the  Ecclesiastical                       Hierarchy, and the beneficial efficacy of their blessings, all the more fruitful than                       those of the Holy Patriarchs of the Old Covenant. Nevertheless, from this great                                                                 118","favor of Dignitaries, he did not want to exclude the simple Priests, having similar                       greatness and power of the Priesthood in one and the other […].                               Indeed, with a great expansion of soul, with singularly expressive and very                       encouraging  letters,  Bishops,  Archbishops,  Cardinals,  Generals  of  religious                       Orders, Dignitaries, simple Priests, adhered to our humble invitation: so, in a few                       years, a unique “Sacred Alliance” of Representatives of the highest Ecclesiastical                       Hierarchy  was  formed  around  this  small  Pious  Work,  consisting  of  a  holiest                       collaboration  of  prayers  and  blessings  in  the  most  solemn  act  of  our  divine                       religion, which is the great sacrifice of the Altar (LC).                       The spiritual favors that the Founder asks from the Sacred Allies all refer directly or                indirectly to the Holy Mass:                               I dared to try the most effective means of Faith, to attract the Divine Mercy                       in the formation of this Pious Work. Since the great Sacrifice of the Holy Mass,                       especially when offered by Bishops who are Successors of the Apostles, is the most                       effective  means  to  obtain  the  Divine  Mercy,  so  I  thought  of  turning  to  Your                       Excellency, begging that you would grant me these three spiritual favors of great                       importance.                               1) That, without assuming any obligation in conscience, you would apply                       once a year a Holy Mass for this Pious Work, that is, for its growth in the Lord.                                2) That, in the daily celebration of the great Sacrifice, in the elevation of                       the Sacred Species, you intend to offer this Pious Work to the Most Holy Heart of                       Jesus, with virtual intention.                                3) That, at the end of the daily Holy Mass, in imparting the holy blessing                       to the people, you would intend to bless this Pious Work, and all its components,                       as if they were present there, with all their efforts, hopes, and desires that concern                       its formation in the Lord. And this also with virtual intention (PPA 1901).                       Consistent with his assurance of faith in the Eucharist, the Founder informs the Sacred                Allies about the undeniable commitment of catechesis on the Holy Mass, in his works:                               … the teaching on the infinite value of the Holy Mass predominates in this                       Pious  Work  and  everyone  is  educated  to  consider  it  as  the  center  of  divine                       wonders, as the most effective, indeed infallible means to obtain every grace, thus                       each day the Holy Mass is offered with the recitation of a special short prayer to                       obtain good Laborers for the Holy Church (PPA 1901).                                … the offering of the Holy Mass obtains every Grace, that the Holy Mass                       is everything, that when the Divine Victim is immolated, the Heavens are opened,                       and the graces come down like rain (PPA 1919).                        Father Hannibal is pleased when he affirmed that the Supreme Pontiff Pius X also enters                the circle of spiritual union, blessing and offering the Rogationist works every day at Holy                Mass.                                … daily, He also offers these works to the Lord in the Holy Mass, extends                       to it all the blessings that he imparts, joins his divine prayers to ours for more                       perfect and profitable fulfillment of our most unique divine mission, which the                       ineffable  divine  Goodness  has  entrusted  to  us  with  those  evangelical  words:                       “Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam” (LC).                                                                 119","In the Saggio di Preziose Adesioni of 1905, the Founder, having confirmed his faith and                confidence in the value of the Holy Mass, offers us the definition of the USAR:                                In fact, in the most severe difficulties for the formation of these Institutes,                       we placed the highest trust in the prayers and blessings of the Holy Prelates of the                       Holy  Church,  and  much  more  in  the  sublime  offering  of  the  Sacrifice  of  the                       Altar.[…]                                In truth, these that we call Adhesions of the Sacred Allies, are not reduced                       to the authorization of mere formality, but have so much in concrete and on the                       positive note: they are spiritual favors of great value; it is a union of faith, prayer,                       and blessings in the most magnificent work among all works of religion, in the                       divine sacrifice of the Holy Mass (Saggio di Preziose Adesioni, 1905).                               Here, oh dear children, is what the “Sacred Alliance” of the Ecclesiastical                       Hierarchy with these least Institutes of the “Evangelical Prayer of the Heart of                       Jesus and the Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus (LC).                       Concluding this part, I think we can safely affirm that, in the Founder's intention, the                USAR is not a union around the Institutes of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine                Zeal, but a union around the Eucharistic Christ along with the Rogationists and the Daughters                of  Divine  Zeal,  united  in  prayer  to  obtain  good  laborers  for  the  whole  Church  and  every                expression of the Church.                  29.7. God's blessings on the greatest of works                       We cannot remain indifferent to the request for \"blessings\" that our Founder asks from                the Sacred Allies in favor of his works. He knew well the value of this ritual gesture with which                God's blessing is invoked, especially in the Eucharistic celebration, where the covenant of                communion with Jesus Christ and the faithful finds fulfillment:                               The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of                       Christ?  The  bread  which  we  break,  is  it  not  a  participation in  the  body  of                       Christ?  Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all                        partake of the one bread (1 Cor 10:16-17). Blessed be the God and Father of our                       Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in                       heavenly places (Eph 1:3).                       It is Christ who fulfills the plan of salvation through the sacrifice of the cross,                present  in  the  celebration  of  the  Eucharist,  where  every  blessing  comes  to  us  in  a                downward movement from the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit.                       Father  Hannibal  declares  his  faith  in  blessings  in  the  sense  formulated  in  the                Prænotanda of the Blessings:                               When God blesses, either directly or through others, the Lord's help is                       always assured, his grace is announced, his fidelity to the covenant is proclaimed.                       When men bless, they praise God's goodness and proclaim his mercy (Prænotanda                       of Blessings, 6).                                                                       120","29.8. The USAR at 360 degrees                        In the LC, after having explained to the congregants the meaning of the USAR, the                Founder places the topic of the Rogate in a broader and deeper ecclesial perspective, which                transcends the horizons of our planet. He continues:                                … besides the “Sacred Alliance,” among the many “spiritual benefactors”                       of  these  least  Institutes,  I  thought  and  partly  realized  two  other  “Sacred                       Alliances” one more precious and vital than the other […].                               I called the first one, “Sacred Alliance of Sympathizers (= Zelatrice)”. It                       consists of an invitation made not to Prelates of the Holy Church, but to simple                       Priests,  who,  upon  acceptance,  they  become  our  “sacred  allies”  not  only  in                       granting  us  the  four  spiritual  favors  but  by  joining  us  more  intimately  and                       fraternally. They love this Pious Work as their own, commit themselves to help,                       accompany, and promote it in every way, not only spiritually, but also temporarily                       […].                               The second of these new “sacred alliances” that I thought of is all spiritual                       […]. It consists in the most intimate, the most paternal, maternal or filial union                       with these pious Works, among people who are great living servants of God, who                       have particular union with God, chosen among the chosen souls, who have a                       reputation for holiness and transmit the sacred perfume, whether they are Priests                       or not, or sacred Virgins, or evangelical laborers, or founders or founders of other                       holy  Works,  or  victims  of  penances  and  spiritual  sufferings  […].  A  special                       invitation is made to them, […] to become, more than sacred allies, “co-founders                       or co-foundresses” of these least institutes.                       Finally:                                … today, pushing myself more and more on the ladder of these ascents of                       the search for divine help, I seem to lift from Earth to Heaven! After the “Sacred                       Alliance  of  the  Prelates  of  the  Holy  Church,”  after  that  idea  of  the  “Sacred                       Alliance of Sympathizers,” after having started that of the Lord’s servants, the                       “Co-founders, and Co-foundresses,” what else could not be thought of on this                       Earth?                               I do not know, but I do know that another “Most Holy Alliance” more                       beautiful, more sublime than all the others, flashed in my mind; that is, a heavenly                       Alliance of “Co-Founders, Sympathizers, and Protectors.” […]                               And full of hope, I conceived the thought that, if […] we turn to the saints                       of the triumphant Church, to the heavenly Hierarchy, to humbly and ardently                       implore their “heavenly Alliance;” if we go to the glorified Souls of those who in                       this life were either Holy Pontiffs, or Holy Founders, or Holy Priests of the one                       and the other Clergy, or Religious Saints, or even simply saints in any state who                       are dear to God, it would be impossible not to achieve such heavenly Alliance.                               It would be impossible for such elect Companions, invited by us, not to                       give us their fullest support.                       Having  summoned  those  on  earth,  Father  Hannibal  also  invites  those  in  heaven  to                concede their adhesion to the USAR, around the altar of the Lord. What else does the Founder                intend to do with this 360-degree extension of the Sacred Alliance, except to realize in faith,                hope, and charity, the truth of the Eucharistic mystery in the terms expressed by the purest                theology?                                                               121","In the Conciliar Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy  Sacrosanctum Concilium 7, we                read:                               Christ indeed always associates the Church with Himself in this great                       work wherein God is perfectly glorified, and men are sanctified. The Church is                       His beloved Bride who calls to her Lord, and through Him offers worship to the                       Eternal Father.                        Moreover:                               The Eucharist is also the sacrifice of the Church. The Church, which is the                       Body of Christ, participates in the offering of its Head. With him, she herself is                       offered whole and entire (CCC 1368).                               The offering of Christ is united not only the members still here on earth,                       but  also  by  those  already  in  the  glory  of  heaven.  In  communion  with  and                       commemorating the Blessed Virgin Mary and all the saints, the Church offers the                       Eucharistic Sacrifice. In the Eucharist, the Church is as it were at the foot of the                       cross with Mary, united to the offering and to the intercession of Christ (CCC                       1370).                       Who knows if Father Hannibal had in mind the scene of the heavenly liturgy when he                elaborated the USAR in his thought, where the crowd sings the praises of Him who sits on the                throne:                               He went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on                        the throne.  And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the                       twenty-four  elders  fell  down  before  the  Lamb,  each  holding  a  harp,  and  with                       golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints (Rev 5: 7-8).                       The Doctrine is proposed again by John Paul II:                               It is not by chance that the Eastern Anaphoras and the Latin Eucharistic                       Prayers honor Mary, the ever-Virgin Mother of Jesus Christ our Lord and God,                       the angels, the holy apostles, the glorious martyrs, and all the saints. This is an                       aspect of the Eucharist which merits greater attention: in celebrating the sacrifice                       of the Lamb, we are united to the heavenly “liturgy” and become part of that great                       multitude  which  cries  out:  “Salvation  belongs  to  our  God  who  sits  upon  the                       throne, and to the Lamb!” (Rev 7:10). The Eucharist is truly a glimpse of heaven                       appearing on earth. It is a glorious ray of the heavenly Jerusalem which pierces                       the clouds of our history and lights up our journey (EdE, 19).                        The elders have glasses, filled with perfume, in their hands, which are the prayers of                the saints, collected and offered in universal homage to God the Father, the goal of our prayer,                with the mediation of the immolated Lamb. This heavenly and ineffable spectacle represents                the subordinate function of intercession that the saints have in paradise, following the example                of Jesus Christ, the only mediator.                       The many prayers with which our Founder asked the intercession of the saints for the                triumph of the Rogate, reveals his feeling of being in full communion with the Blessed Virgin                Mary, the apostles, the martyrs, the angels, and all the saints, especially in celebration of the                one sole Eucharist.                        This is the reason why he could not but also involve in the USAR the citizens of the                heavenly homeland because their understanding the Rogate is much more superior than they                could have when they were on this earth. He writes in fact:                                                                122","Indeed we are more confident that the higher the interest that the new                       heavenly Allies will take of us and of these Works, the greater the knowledge that                       they have in God of the importance of the great Rogate of the propagation of such                       beneficial Prayer and its unfailing effects (LC).                        Father  Hannibal  writes  a  regulation  of  the  only  heavenly-bound  Rogationist                Congregation of the Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus composed of 15 articles, of which I                quote some passages:                                Art. 1. The “heavenly-bound Congregation of the Rogationists of the Heart                       of  Jesus”  refers  to  a  Congregation  consisting  of  the  “heavenly”  and  the                       “wayfarers” that is, composting of members of the “Triumphant” Church and the                       “militant” Church. […]                               Art.  8.  […]  Then,  all,  including  the  traveling  congregants  and  the                       Companions will unite themselves through the Immaculate Heart of Mary to the                       sweetest Heart of Jesus who longs and desire for the salvation of souls, when at                       night on the mountain he said: “Rogate ergo, etc.” This magnificent Union in the                       Most Holy Eucharist: “the Mass”!                                Art. 9. The only immediate Supreme Superior of the unique “heavenly-                       bound”  Congregation  is  the  Adorable  Heart  of  Jesus,  especially  in  the  great                       Mystery of his Infinite Love: the Most Holy Eucharist who will be considered as                       the true Founder. The immediate supreme Superior General etc. is the Blessed                       Virgin  Mary  Immaculate  under  every  title,  who  will  be  regarded  as  the  true                       Foundress. Their only Vice Regent will be the Patriarch St. Joseph, who will be                       considered as the true Co-founder (Scritti estesi, vol. 3, n. 1568).                  29.9. Christ identifies himself with his Rogate                        Rogate Dominum messis is the person of Jesus and we can also say of the whole Church                (cf. John Paul II, Message to the Rogationists).                        John Paul II, in his message to the participants in the Rogationist General Chapter, on                              33                July 28, 1986,  with happy intuition, he pierces through the depths of the Rogate, revealing its                Christological and ecclesiological dimensions which qualify our charism and exalt its objective                transcendence.                    33  “Rogate Dominum messis”! In these words of Jesus, in the Latin language, is the foundation, the source of your                spiritual unity, of your Religious Community, of your Congregation.                   It is not a figure, but above all a Word: “Rogate Dominum messis”; it is the whole figure, a person, that of                Jesus, and we can say the whole person of the Church.                   These are profoundly ecclesiological words.                   The Church lives by prayer, lives by the prayer of Jesus, by his own Rogate, and seeks to share the very Rogate                of the Son of God. Thus, it builds itself up, grows, and becomes the Mystical Body of Christ.                   And, as rightly said by your Superior General, at the center and at the top of this Rogate of Christ and of the                Church, in Christ, there is always the Eucharist.                   I wish that our Eucharist, today, as the highest expression of the Rogate of Christ and of the Church, be fruitful                for you Rogationists, for your General Chapter, for the further growths of your Congregation in the spirit of your                Founder, to whom you always refer. It is an essential reference because this belongs to the same substance of the                different Religious Congregations: to live continuing the charism of the Founders. So, I wish you every good                during this assembly, the General Chapter, and the further growth of your religious community in its spiritual                growth and in its charismatic ministry in the Church of Christ.                                                               123","In this intervention, with a daring, fascinating, and not easily interpreted perspective,                he presents the Eucharistic Christ, who identifies himself with his Rogate, the identification                that involves his mystical Body.                        By involving the Church, the Christ of the Rogate and prayer (= rogation), he, the                absolute Rogationist, presents himself for imitation not only by the Rogationists but also by                the bishops and priests, as successors to the apostles, to whom he gave the command of the                Rogate.                        For this reason, the message is like a beacon that casts an intense light on the subject                we are dealing with, because in it, we also find the most profound Christological terms of the                USAR.                       Here are some statements from the text:                        1. Rogate Dominum messis, is the whole figure, a person, that of Jesus, and we can say                the whole person of the Church.                       2. The Church lives by prayer, lives by the prayer of Christ, by his own Rogate, and                seeks to share in the very Rogate of the Son of God. In this way, the Church is formed, grows,                and becomes the Mystical Body of Christ.                       3. The Eucharist, today, as the highest expression of the Rogate of Christ and of the                Church.                       Considering the context of the message and for that fact that it is addressed to the                Rogationists, the word Rogate is not to be understood in a general sense, which is valid for all                prayers, and also for the prayer commanded by Christ to obtain good laborers, but it refers                exclusively to the Rogate of the gospel passages that inspires the charism of the Rogationists.                The whole message moves along the charismatic horizon, according to the understanding of                Father Hannibal.                       The Holy Father affirms that in this word: “Rogate Dominum messis” there is the whole                figure, a person, that of Jesus. Above all, in this declaration of the Pope, the term “Rogate”                cannot mean the command that the Lord gives to the disciples to pray the Lord of the harvest                but represents the mystery of the praying person (= persona orante) of Jesus himself.                       In his message, the Rogate is undoubtedly a command; but the command that Jesus                receives  from  the  Father,  as  stated  in  the  document  of  the  VII  General  Chapter  (1986)                Rogationist Communion and Community, no. 24:                               The Son entering the world says: “Here I come to do your will, O God”                       (Heb 10, 7); he obeys the Father's will expressed in the Rogate, and he is the                       incarnated response to this will. […] [The Rogate], uttered by the Father for the                       salvation of men, is accepted by the Son who fulfills it by assuming our humanity                       lived in the Spirit.                       The Pope's thought coincides with that of our document: Before being the one who                commands the Rogate, Jesus Christ is the one who prays the Rogate. In the dialectic of the                message, the Rogate of Christ is not the imperative, but the response to the imperative; that is,                the  “prayer  of  Christ”  or  “the  Christ  of  the  prayer”  (=  Cristo  del  Rogate    o  Cristo  della                rogazione).                       The praying Jesus (= Gesù orante), based on Heb 10: 7, manifests the true ontological                context of the mystery of his existence and his intrinsic tension of obedience to fully satisfy the                demands of the will of the Father who wants all men to be saved, through the historical and                                                                 124","ministerial mediation of collaborators, which the Incarnate Word asks of the heavenly Father                (the one who calls), offering himself in the sacrifice of the cross.                       The document of the General Chapter of 1986 refers to the passage of a sermon on July                1, where the Founder highlights the infinite availability of the Word:                                The Son adheres to the divine Rogationist imperative assuming the form                       of  a  servant  with  the  words  of  the  Prophet  Isaiah:  \"Here  I  am,  send  me\"                       (Sermonettes of July 1, in Scritti, vol. 54, p. 51).                       Since Christ’s is an existential prayer, not made with words, but with the offering of                one's life:                        1. The prayer (= rogare) of Christ and his person are a perfect equivalence, for which,                       2. Christ identifies himself with his prayer (= rogare).                       Since the prayer of Jesus reaches the absolute summit in the mysterium eucharisticum                that makes the mysterium paschale present on the altar (cf. EdE 2), rightly, John Paul II can                affirm that the Eucharist is the highest expression of the Rogate of Christ.                  29.10. The Church recognizes herself in the Christ of Rogate                       In the expression, Rogate Dominum messis, John Paul II, recognizes not only the person                of Jesus but the whole person of the Church, the Christus totus. In other words, the Rogate                Dominum messis is a constitutive element of the mystical Body of Christ; hence, it seeks to                share in this very Rogate of the Son of God. Consequently, all members let themselves be                involved “by” and “in” the prayer (= rogare) of the Eucharistic Christ.                       The level, degree, and depth of this conformation-identification with the Christ of the                Rogate vary, obviously, according to the state of life and the personal vocation of each one.                        By  the  sacrament  of  Orders  that  they  received,  the  bishops  and  priests  reach  the                insuperable and highest possible summit on earth of the approximation to the person of Christ,                who entrusted to the apostles and their successors his powers, mission, and harvest, through                 the three imperatives: “do” - “go” - “pray.”                       Jesus commanded only to His disciples:                        1. Do this in remembrance of me (Lk 22:19).                       2. As the Father has sent me, even so, I send you (Jn 20:21). Go (Mt 28:19).                       3. Then he said to his disciples: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; Pray                therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” (Mt 9: 37-38).                       The three commands are extremely connected by the single plan of salvation, which                Christ carried out, and which before his ascension to the right of the Father, handed over to the                apostles and their successors. They are appointed to continue his same work, to spread out and                prolong the saving humanity of Jesus Christ in a dimension that exceeds time.                       These three imperatives establish a mysterious but real and effective union that binds                Christ to the bishops and priests, predestined to conform to the image of his Son in a mysterious                and original way, incomprehensible to the human mind.                        Therefore, the three imperatives “do” - “go” - “pray” have the same specific weight, a                single soteriological objective: the building of the Church, the coming of the kingdom. They                demand the same obedience from ministers of the Eucharist, of the Word, and of the Rogate,                                                                125","committing  themselves  in  the  same  title  and  in  equal  measure,  by  the  obvious  essential                interconnection existing between the Eucharist, the Word, and the Rogate.                       The bishops and priests, as much as they cannot remain neutral before the “do” and the                “go” commands with which Christ entrusts to them his sacramental Body and his Word, so                they cannot remain indifferent to the imperative: “pray” with which he entrusts to them his                sheep and his ripe and abandoned harvest.                        In the message for the World Day of Prayer for Vocations in 1984, John Paul II defines                prayer  to  obtain  good  laborers  as  a  command  that  challenges  our  faith  and  touches  our                conscience as baptized. Obviously, the bishops and priests are the first to be challenged and to                feel their conscience enkindled by this imperative.                       We realize why our Holy Founder has put in to play all his potentials, expressed in the                inspiration he received from the Spirit, and in the ecclesial plan of the resource-idea.                        Let us attempt to confront the affirmations of John Paul II: the Church seeks to share in                this very Rogate of the Son of God and the Eucharist, it is the highest expression of the Rogate                of Christ, with the nature and definition of the USAR dictated by Father Hannibal: a union of                faith, prayer, and blessings in the most excellent work of all works of religion, in the divine                sacrifice of Holy Mass.                       When the Pope says that the Church seeks to share in the very Rogate of the Son of God,                does he not mean that the Church, the whole Church, all the members of the Mystical Body,                must become part of the Rogate of Jesus Christ?                       Father Hannibal sees the same Church and analyzes it by making that kind of hierarchy                that we read in chapter 29.5: “Who must pray and why?”                       And precisely the reason for the resource-idea lies in this hierarchy. Indeed, both the                Founder and John Paul II agree that the whole Church must gather around the Eucharistic Christ                to share in this very Rogate of the Son of God; in effect, the Eucharist is the highest expression                of the Rogate of Christ.                       The Founder puts the bishops and priests, recipients of the USAR, at the top of the                hierarchy for two reasons:                       1. because they and they alone are the ministers of the Eucharist: without priests, there                is no Eucharist;                       2. because, as shepherds of the flock and stewards of the harvest, they feel the duty and                the urgency to spread the Rogate.                       I start by saying that the word “prayer” in these notes always refers to the Rogate of                Christ. In my opinion, the expression of John Paul II “to share” coincides with that of the                Founder’s “union of faith.” In fact, both expressions mean that the members of the Mystical                Body must be united to Christ-head in prayer. Indeed, Christ always associates the Church, his                beloved Bride, with Himself in this great work (SC 7).                       So that our prayer will be acceptable to the Heavenly Father, it has to be “deified”; and                to be “deified,” it must echo in the temple of Christ’s humanity because only through him can                we enter into dialogue with the Father.                        It is the truth expressed in the Institutio generalis of the Liturgy of the Hours, no. 7,                which contains the famous text of Saint Augustine:                               … It is the one Savior of his body, our Lord Jesus Christ, who prays for                       us, prays in us, and is prayed to by us. He prays for us as our priest; he prays in                                                               126","us as our head; he is prayed to by us as our God. Let us recognize, therefore, our                       voice in him and his voice in us.                       Christ is the mediator, the subject, and the object of prayer. As a mediator, he                prays for us; as a subject, he is the one praying who unites the Church to himself, making                himself present in those who are united in his name; then, he is directly invoked by us as                God.                        In the definition of the USAR, the expression “union of faith” should be extended to                the whole praying Church (= Chiesa orante) “in” and “with” Christ, who in the Eucharist is                present in the glorious state. He is at the right hand of the Father because he always lives to                intercede in our favor (Heb 7:25). Thus, He is not the prisoner of the tabernacles but is with                the angels and the whole heavenly court.                       When celebrating the Eucharist, the Sacred Ally must see with the eyes of faith the                visible presence of the participating assembly and the invisible - but equally real - presence of                the heavenly Jerusalem, around the one altar.                       This was the faith of Father Hannibal, who wanted to add to the three Sacred Alliances                on earth a heavenly Alliance of Zealous Co-Founders and Protectors.                  29.11. Rogate – Priesthood - Eucharist                       Another  affirmation  by  John  Paul  II  surprises  us  and  leads  us  to  reflect  on  the                relationship that exists between the Rogate, the priesthood, and the Eucharist: The Church lives                by prayer, lives by the prayer of Jesus, by its own Rogate, and seeks to share the very Rogate                of the Son of God. Thus, it builds itself up, grows, and becomes the mystical body of Christ.                       With these declarations, John Paul II repeats the same sequence of verbal terms (lives,                builds, grows, becomes the mystical Body of Christ), which we find in the encyclical EdE and                 establishes an essential relationship between the Rogate and the Eucharist.                       The ground for the relationship between the Eucharist and the Rogate is found in a third                term: the priesthood. In fact:                        -  the priest is the causative principle (obviously secondary, subordinate, instrumental)                           of the Eucharist;                       -  The Rogate, by the will of Christ, is the causative principle of the priest, who is                           obtained through the prayer commanded by Jesus.                       A  sequence  and  an  ascending  movement  are  thus  established:  Rogate-priesthood-                Eucharist. In fact:                        1. Without the Rogate, there are no priests.                               Our Lord Jesus Christ, with those words, wanted to show that the salvation                       of this mystical harvest of souls is his Priests. But to obtain this inestimable good,                       it is necessary to ask it from the Most High Owner who is God Himself. He wanted                       to instruct us that his Priests do not arise by chance, they do not form themselves,                       they cannot be formed by human effort: instead, they come from the Divine Mercy,                       which creates them, which generates them, which gives them to the world; and                       that, if we do not pray to have them, we will not obtain them! (PPA 1919).                       2. Without priests, there can be no Eucharist.                                                                  127","One cannot  conceive the Eucharist  without  the priesthood; there is  no                       Royal Priesthood without the Eucharist [...]. They are and will be inseparable                       from each other (MB III, p. 309).                               There  is  no  priesthood  without  the  Eucharist.  There  is  no  Eucharistic                       sacrifice without a priesthood (John Paul II, Angelus, June 1, 1997).                       Not because it had to be this way, but because in the current economy of salvation, God                wanted it this way. The Lord wants ministers of the New Covenant (cf. 2 Cor 3:6) who, without                being mediators, are \"servants\" of the only mediation of Christ.                       3. Without the Eucharist, there can be no Church.                                The Church draws her life from the Eucharist (EdE 1).                                The Church draws her life from Christ in the Eucharist; by him she is fed,                       and by him she is enlightened (EdE 6).                               The Church is built through sacramental communion with the Son of God                       who was sacrificed for our sake (EdE 21).                               The celebration of the Eucharistic is the center of process of the Church’s                        growth (EdE 21).                       According to Father Hannibal, Jesus Christ in Sacrament is the life of the Church (MB                III,  p.  310).  In  the  understanding  of  Father  Hannibal  and  John  Paul  II,  the  Eucharist,  the                Priesthood, and the Rogate are interdependent, correlative, inseparable terms that are founded                on a dynamic unity.                       John Paul II affirms: If the Eucharist is the center and summit of the life of the Church,                it is likewise the center and summit the priestly ministry (EdE 31). Hence, it is legitimate to                deduce: if the Eucharist and the priesthood are the center and summit of the life of the Church,                in a certain way, the Rogate is also the center and summit of the life of the Church because                without the Rogate there are no priests, and without priests, there is no Church.                       Saint Ignatius of Antioch affirms it:                               Similarly, all should respect the deacons as Jesus Christ, just as all should                       regard the bishop as the image of the Father, and the priests as God’s senate and                       the college of apostles. Without these three orders, you cannot begin to speak of                       a Church (Office of the Readings, 2nd reading, Tuesday XXVII week in Ordinary                        Time).                       In order to make it understood that apostles and successors are necessary in the mystery                and the history of salvation, at the supreme moment of his life, Jesus knew that his hour had                come  to  depart  out  of  this  world  to  the  Father  (Jn  13:  1),  in  the  great  priestly  discourse                addressed to the apostles during the Last Supper in which he instituted the sacrament of the                Eucharist and the Priesthood, he uses the allegory of the vine and the branches, which applies                to all Christians; however, the priests are involved in it in the firsthand, because Jesus said it in                a priestly environment and addressed primarily and specifically to the apostles.                       The words of Jesus: I am the vine, you the branches, spoken in the dramatic climate of                the Upper Room, just a few hours before leaving this earth, acquire a particular meaning,                because they express the project of God who desires the salvation of men by means of the                collaboration of men.                       The branches are attached to the vine and are an integral part of it: there is no true vine                without branches, just as there cannot be branches without the vine. If the vine is necessary for                                                               128","the branches, also the branches are necessary to the vine, because they are the ones that bear                the fruit until it is fully ripe. Similarly, we can affirm the mutual need of Jesus and the disciples,                in the present economy of salvation.                                                                                                                                               129","30. The Heavenly Rogationists                          Among the “spiritual industries” that our Founder devised, I believe that of the heavenly                 Rogationists can be inserted into the charismatic horizon of the resource-idea.                       Father Tusino writes:                               He strove to seek vocations for his two Congregations to make the Rogate                       triumph in the world; but then he thought: the triumph of the Rogate concerns the                       saints in heaven not less but even more than we do. Thus, they will protect the                       Congregations  which  are  consecrated  to  the  Rogate,  by  obtaining  for  them                       numerous vocations, and at the same time praying that the Lord sends laborers to                       the Holy Church. For this, they are neither more nor less than the Rogationists                       and Daughters of Heavenly Zeal (AP, p. 411).                        In a letter to Father Vitale, Father Hannibal writes:                               It is understandable that for now, we proclaim those heavenly ones who                       we honor with our devotion, those whom we love, admire, and invoke, etc. … with                       the sure belief that they would be pleased to become Rogationists and Daughters                       of Divine Zeal. In short, they are our heavenly congregants! In time, the heavenly                       vocations will undoubtedly increase! (AP, p. 412).                        They will certainly grow, not only because of the other proclamations, but also because,                along with our Holy Founder, there are also his disciples: the Rogationists and the Daughters                of Divine Zeal, who left this earth to join him in Paradise, and as well as the ever-growing                members of the Heavenly Alliance.                       Following  Father  Hannibal's  teaching,  the  liturgical  calendar  of  the  Rogationists                recommends, when it is allowed, to celebrate the Eucharist and the Liturgy of the Hours in                honor of the heavenly Rogationist, whose memory we remember. If this initiative falls within                the tradition of the Congregation, I think it would be good to update it.                                                                                               130","31. To be good laborers                         To be good laborers is the third dimension of the fourth vow, which in the current                             *                Constitutions  it is expressed this way:                               To direct daily all that constitutes the manifold apostolic activity of the                       Congregation to the goals of the Rogate. This means: to be good laborers for the                       coming of God’s kingdom, by working for the temporal and spiritual welfare of                       the neighbor – following the example and teaching of Father Founder – in the                       education and sanctification of children and the youth, especially the poor and                       the abandoned, and in the evangelization, human promotion, and help of the poor                       (Constitutions of 1998, art. 63.3).                        The scene of the Exodus is a constant event in the history of salvation:                               Then the Lord said: “I have seen the affliction of my people who are in                       Egypt  and  have  heard  their  cry  because  of  their  taskmasters;  I  know  their                       sufferings, and I have come down to deliver them […] So now, go! I am sending                       you…” (Ex 3:7 ff.)                                God chose to rely on men. Father Hannibal writes:                                What were these places before? and what are they now? Many years ago,                       human hands built these little houses for the poor to inhabit, and the poor lived in                       them; and this place became like a small village of poor people. Then, the Most                       High God casts his eyes on this place, because He does not look at the grand                       palaces of the rich, but looks at the shanties of the poor (Scritti, vol. 54, p. 4).                        Hannibal, an admirable minister of Jesus’ compassion for the crowds (Preface of the                Mass of Saint Hannibal), goes, sees, meets with misery, intervenes. Like Moses, docile to the                enlightenment of the Spirit, he consecrates his life, his belongings, the wealth of his spiritual                and intellectual gifts - which could have given him brilliant prospects in his historical future -                for the release from the material, physical, moral and social slavery of the abandoned crowd of                the Avignone Quarter.                 31.1. Relationship between the Rogate and Charitable Work                        Before considering the specific apostolate of the Rogationists - charity at the service of                the little ones and the poor - it is useful to make some brief considerations on the relationship                between the Rogate and the Charities willed by the Founder. Father Tusino writes:                                Ideally  and  historically,  the  apostolate  of  the  care  of  orphans  in  the                       Father’s life is linked to his Rogationist mission. […]                     *  EN: The Author cites the article in the 1998 Constitutions, which was then in vigor at the time of the writing.  In                the current 2010 Constitutions, the third dimension of the fourth vow is in art. 29, paragraph 3, which states:                   Following  the  footsteps  of  St.  Hannibal,  we are  compelled  to  a  particular  pastoral  charity  and  to the                 untiring and  paternal gift  of  our  whole self  to  the little ones of  the  Kingdom. In  the  works of  spiritual and                temporal  charity  towards  the neighbor,  we find the legitimate and immediate consequence of  the mission we                assumed with the vow of the Rogate. We dedicate ourselves to the human, social, and religious promotion of the                boys and youths, especially poor and needy, to  educate them in  the faith and prepare them professionally. We                commit ourselves to take care of the human promotion and evangelization of the poor, and we commit ourselves                to bring the message of the Rogate to all peoples (ad Gentes).                                                              131","We  also  know  from  the  Father  how  the  Works,  in  their  origin,  were                       historically tied to the Rogate. When he went in the midst of the mob of Avignone                       Quarter, he remembered the gospel  scene of  the wandering  crowds without  a                       shepherd,  the Lord’s groans  for  the plentiful  harvest  which gets  lost, and the                       divine command: Rogate ergo... “From then on,” he says, “I committed myself,                       with my meager strengths, in the spiritual and temporal relief of that abandoned                       crowd” (AP, p. 606; Scritti, NI vol. 10, p. 207).                        The historical fact attested by the Founder is also referred to by Father Tusino with the                following  words:  We  also  know  from  the  Father  how  the  Works,  in  their  origin,  were                historically tied to the Rogate is confirmed in the Regulations written by Father Hannibal for                the “Poor girls of the Sacred Heart of Jesus”. Initially, the Founder decided to found the                Congregation of the Daughters of Divine Zeal, then, later, that of the Rogationists, for the                running of orphanages. In March 1887, the first four girls entered the novitiate. Some months                earlier (perhaps in January or February), he wrote the first Regulation for the nascent female                Congregation,  which  would  assume  the  running  of  the  orphanages.  It  does  not  contain                disciplinary  norms,  or  educational  plans,  or  something  similar.  There  is  no  mention  of                orphanage and orphans. It is articulated exclusively on the charism of the Rogate. So much so                that  it  is  a  document  of  extreme  theological  and  charismatic  importance,  one  of  the  most                beautiful pages written by the Founder on the Rogate. The first Regulation, which also contains                disciplinary articles, was written on April 29, 1887.                               Our  most  noble  uniform,  “Rogate  ergo  Dominum  messis,  ut  mittat                       operarios in messem suam”, while on the one hand commits us to a continuous                       prayer to ask the God of mercies for good laborers to the Holy Church, on the                       other hand, it also obliges us to the works of charity that, with the divine help, we                       can feebly carry out. So far, these Works are two: the education and salvation of                       abandoned orphans, and the evangelization and help of the most miserable and                       destitute  poor.  These  are  two  holy  missions  that  we  must  attend  with  great                       transport of Faith and Love (Regole della Pia Congregazione dei Rogazionisti del                       Cuore di Gesù, November 9, 1914).                       The following citation highlights the incalculable disproportion that exists between the                few orphans that are saved and the few poor that are evangelized with the millions that are                lost. Father Hannibal goes beyond the small boundaries of the Avignone Quarter and, with his                faith and charity, extends his gaze toward the vast world of men that God wants all to save, and                offers his availability. But, aware of the limits of his very meager strengths, he looks for a way                out and finds it wide, immense in those adorable words of Our Lord Jesus Christ: “Rogate                ergo Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam,” which is the secret of all good                works and the salvation of all souls. In fact, he writes:                                I thought: what are these few orphans who are saved, and these few poor                       who are evangelized, compared to the millions who get lost and lie abandoned                       like sheep without a shepherd? I looked at the limits of my meager strengths and                       the smallest extent of my capacities, and I looked for a way out. I found it wide,                       immense,  in  those  adorable  words  of  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ:  Rogate  ergo                       Dominum messis, ut mittat operarios in messem suam. Then, I seemed to have                       found the secret of all good works and the salvation of all souls (AP, pp. 139-140).                        The Daughters of Divine Zeal and Rogationists cannot ignore the connection between                the Rogate and Works and the related constitutional obligation,  repeatedly emphasized with                force by Father Hannibal.                                                                 132","The sacred and expressive name of Daughters of Divine Zeal obliges us to                       zeal for whatever interest of the Divine Heart of Jesus, any charitable work, zeal                       being the fervor of charity. Similarly, the distinctive character of zelatrix of that                       divine command: Rogate ergo, obliges us, as much as possible, with divine grace                       and with all the efforts of goodwill, to be good and active laborers ourselves in                       the vast field of the mystical harvest, in all kinds of holy spiritual and temporal                       endeavors, to win souls to the Most Holy Heart of Jesus, for his greatest glory and                       infinite consolation (Regolamento per le Figlie del Divino Zelo del Cuore di Gesù,                       December 15, 1920).                       When charity, in the vertical dimension of man’s communion with God reaches the                maximum level, either individually or in the community, extraordinarily intense pressure is                unleashed (zeal: fervor of charity) from the heart of a charitable man. A convinced faith and                sincere  love  cannot  remain  repressed,  but  they  tend  to  open  and  manifest  themselves  in                collaboration with Christ for the salvation of men.                        The Founder deduces from the incarnation of the charism in the life of his disciples                another undeniable reason which establishes the natural and inseparable connection between                the Rogate and Works of Charity. As we have said elsewhere (cf. above, in 10), the charism                reaches the depths of being, engaging the existence of the consecrated person. It is the inspiring                and dynamic principle that presides over the religious life and apostolic works of the Institute                (cf. General Chapter of 1980, Documents and Decrees, 94).                        Therefore, the Rogationist has to act according to his identity, which is the one shared                by the Christ of the Rogate, who not only implores and commands to pray but at the same time                performs works of charity, as a good worker consecrated and sent by the Father (cf. Acts 10:38).                        Father Hannibal highlights the absurd inconsistency that would result if his spiritual                children would reduce their being Rogationists to only praying to obtain the good laborers.                Indeed, the ten words that make up the decalogue of those consecrated to the Rogate contain a                term that, before being attributed to those who are the object of their specific prayer, must be                applied to themselves, as laborers ready to offer themselves to any work charity.                               … the two Institutes of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal                       do not remain in carrying out in themselves the saving command, nor are they                       limited only to the normative implication of the prayer “ut Dominus messis mittat                       operarios.” Instead, they apply to themselves two other meanings, which should                       be interpreted in  the broadest  sense of  the word of  God, recognizing  in it an                       infinite extension of significances. The more it is contemplated, the better it is                       appreciated by them and by others.                               And these are the first two practical and compelling meanings. The first                       arises from the word “operarios.” What is this first compelling meaning? It is                       this: finding ourselves committed to every syllable of this mystical decalogue (that                       is to say, the ten words with which it is composed: Rogate - ergo - Dominum -                       messis - ut - mittat - operarios - in - messem - suam), we should be ashamed to                       ask His Divine Majesty, and the Most Holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary, for good                       laborers of the mystical harvest of souls, if we ourselves of the two Institutes did                       not strive with all the strength of soul, heart, mind, and body, with divine help and                       with all goodwill and right intention, to be good laborers ourselves in the mystical                       harvest of souls. Those divine words with which we ask laborers for the immense                       harvest of souls, keep us ready to serve, although always limited, but with divine                       assistance, for whatever work of charity, both spiritual and corporal, to which the                                                                133","endeavors of those who belong to the two Institutes of the Heart of Jesus can reach                       out (AR, p. 671).                       In another text, Father Hannibal repeats the same concept. He connects our mission                with the obligation that comes from the vow of the Rogate, of which it is a legitimate and                immediate  consequence,  and  also  suggests  the  formula  to  be  implemented  so  that  this                imperative that comes from the vow can have the best effectiveness. In fact, he says:                                Then, as a legitimate and immediate consequence of the mission assumed                       with the fourth vow, these two Congregations would have to take care of the works                       of charity and assistance to their neighbors. Forasmuch they pray incessantly to                       obtain the good laborers for the Holy Church, if they are to obey the desire of the                       Most Holy Heart of Jesus, expressed in that divine command, they must strive, as                       far  as  human  limits  allow,  to  be  themselves  good  laborers.  Furthermore,  the                       perfection of their fourth vow not only commits them to this unceasing prayer but                       also  obliges  them  to  spread  this  spirit  everywhere,  which  is  best  achieved  by                       educating orphans and catechizing the poor, teaching them how desirable is the                       most desirable of all Graces, which is the obedience to the command of the Most                       Holy Heart of Jesus, and to get them used to put it into practice (PPA 1901).                        The  Founder  affirms  that  the  effectiveness  of  the  constitutional  duty  to  spread  the                Rogate is directly proportional to the Rogationists’ commitment to the mission of educating                orphans, catechizing the poor, and teaching them the Evangelical Prayer, according to the                program that the Founder himself has established and has carried out since the beginning of his                mission in the Avignone Quarter.                       From the above citation, it can be deduced that the apostolate of charity, although not                specifically but only consequentially (cf. above, in 21), fully enters into the charismatic area to                the point of constituting its conditio sine qua non for our Evangelical Rogation be effective.                Furthermore, Father Hannibal wants to emphasize that his spiritual children cannot dare to ask                the Lord of the harvest for good laborers if they remain idle and do not recognize and act as a                consequence of the golden thread that unites the three dimensions in an essential unity, which                are  strictly  connected  and  objectively  related  among  themselves:  evangelical  prayer  (=                rogazione evangelica), zeal for the spread of the Rogate, and apostolate of charity.                        That the charitable works enter into the specific mission of the Congregation of the                Daughters of Divine Zeal and the Rogationists is also understood by the fact that the Founder                did not limit this apostolate to the period of his life on earth, but projected it to a future without                limits, through the foundation of the two Congregations. He says:                               The continuity of any work of charity preoccupied my thoughts; it was one                       of the main goals of my poor efforts. It was necessary to form a community of                       sisters to achieve this objective of no little importance. Not being able to have                       either  the Daughters of  Charity or  the Daughters  of  Saint Anne, I thought  of                       forming the Daughters of Divine Zeal (Speech to the Aristocracy Committee of                       Messina, August 20, 1906).                               Unfortunately, no one is indeed a prophet in his homeland. But, more than                       the criticism of the present, I was more afraid of what will happen in the future. I                       feared rather that, tomorrow, after my death, this orphanage would fail; and then                       a just blame would be hurled against my memory, because I was incapable of                       making this orphanage of salvation for the poor and orphaned girls stable and                       lasting (Speech to the Aristocracy Committee of Messina, August 20, 1906).                                                                134","31.2. Obligatory status of the apostolate of charity                        In chapter 21, we found out that between the praying dimension (i.e. to obtain good                laborers) and the apostolic dimension (i.e. to do the charitable works, although these do not                identify us as Rogationists, cf. chap. 21.1.), concerning the charism and the vow, there is a                relationship of equality: they reach the same level and have the same binding force.                       Father Hannibal firmly affirms that zeal for the praying dimension must also find its                expression in the apostolate of charity in favor of the little ones and the poor:                               Let us, therefore, take great care of abandoned orphans […] here it is                       essential to consider that we must ensure to extend this zeal to all the tender and                       young souls, whether they are orphans or not (AR, p. 288).                       To distinguish them or prefer one and neglect the other would be to violate or even                destroy the charism and vow. Our Founder dedicated his existence to the fulfillment of the two                charismatic spheres: the evangelical Rogation and charity. He affirms: “I dedicated myself from                my youth to that holy word of the Gospel: Rogate etc.,” and “even if they do not identify us as                Rogationists (cf. chap. 21), from my youth I devoted myself to this single purpose, that is, to                alleviate the misery of the people” (AP, p. 491). We can find the first citation in the letter                addressed to Pius X, dated July 11, 1909, the second, in the speech to the Charitable Committee                of Taormina.                        We conclude this paragraph with a remarkable statement by Father Valentino Macca,                who admirably described the charismatic features of our Founder and which strongly highlights                Father Hannibal’s deep conviction about the essential interconnection between the Rogate and                charity:                                From the very first moment he understood his vocation as Founder, the                       Servant of God did not doubt that “the Rogate and charity” were two essential                       elements of the same reality. Indeed, while charity towards God and neighbor is                       the reason for Father Hannibal’s life, the prayer for vocations commanded by                       Jesus  Christ  was  understood  and  valued  by  him  as  the  supreme  means  for                       universal charity (PS, Report of Father Valentino Macca, vol. I, p. 11).                  31.3. Apostolate of the orphans: reasons and hypotheses of the choice                        Father Tusino writes: The Servant of God was distinguished by charity towards his                neighbor, but among this neighbor, his most tender heartbeats were for the orphans, especially                of both parents (AP, p. 606).                        Why among many activities and charitable expressions did the Founder choose and                institutionalize the orphanages? We need to distinguish:                  1. The burning desire to reach everyone.                        In Father Hannibal’s Writings, the expression salvation of souls is one of the most                frequent; it has an impressive repetitiveness index, together with the glory of God. It constitutes                the fundamental and all-encompassing reason of his being and doing: I will nourish in my heart                the ardent desire for the salvation of all the children of the world (Declarations and Promises,                III).                       To those who receive the Rogationist vocation from the Spirit and want to enter the                Congregation he founded, Father Hannibal makes them sign a formal declaration, by which                                                               135","they attest, in an unconditionally definite way, the correlation between the Rogate and works                of charity, as well as the ardent desire to make charity all-extensive for the universal salvation                of men, through the Rogate.                                I declare that from these precepts of charity, I have formed the goal of my                       entire priestly ministry and religious life in this Institute. Therefore, I promise that,                       under the guidance of holy obedience, I shall not spare myself in anything for the                       spiritual and temporal well-being of my neighbor. To possibly extend this charity                       to  all  the world, to  embrace intentionally and  universally the  greater spiritual                       and  temporal benefits of my present and future  neighbors, I will consider  the                       Evangelical Rogation of the Heart of Jesus as the most efficacious means, which                        forms the special mission of this Pious Institute (Declarations and Promises, IV).                 2. The concrete choices                       The concrete choices obviously could not reach the boundless utopian horizons of the                torment that burned in his heart. He acted with prudence and wisdom. He had to take account                of a thousand conditions inside and outside the Works. Finally, he turned his attention, love,                efforts, sufferings, everything he had and everything he was to the abandoned little ones. In my                opinion, there are two main reasons:                        a)  A  first  reason  could  be  attributed  to  the  psychic  structure  of  the  Founder,  who                           became orphaned  at  the age of fifteen months. The mother (a  widow of barely                           twenty-three years old) was forced to entrust him to an old, unsociable, hysterical                           aunt, who was always shut in environments without air and light, which filled the                           child’s  head  with  tales  and  horrifying  images  of  ferocious  beasts.  This  bitter                           experience  engendered  in  Hannibal  a  keen  sensibility,  finesse,  and  tenderness                           towards  the  little  ones.  However,  the  choice  of  orphanages  was  not  a  kind  of                           vindication of the historical situation in which he found himself as a child - although                           this experience played its providential role at the level of mediation -, but a reason                           of supernatural order, an absolutely charismatic choice, that is, dictated by the                           Spirit. We must not forget that the understanding of the charism also extends to its                           mission.                       b)  The  second  reason  is  pedagogical  and  formative.  Father  Hannibal  founded  the                           orphanages, not to remove the little ones from the family, but to give them the                           family they did not have; to pluck them out of the mud (cf. AP, p. 606), understood                           as all aspects toxic to the person, in the physical and moral dimension. The principal                           motivation, in the absolute sense, is salvation.                               We come now, blessed children in Jesus Christ, to discuss the orphanages,                       that  is  to  say,  the  great  mission  that  we  have  assumed  to  gather  lost,  poor,                       abandoned orphaned children of both sexes, to rescue them from losing their soul                       and body. In the most tender age, we remove them from abandonment, from the                       perversity of a wicked world, from hunger, from extreme misery, from destructive                       idleness, from scandals and constant dangers, from temporal and eternal ruins!                       Oh, how pleasing it is to the Most Holy Heart of Jesus this work of salvation of                       the abandoned orphans! What a gain of the soul would this ever be: snatch them                       away  from  the  devil  and  give  them  to  God!  (Treatise  of  the  Orphanages,                       Taormina, January 26, 1926, in Scritti, vol. 2, n. 1520).                               The salvation of abandoned orphans will be one of the favorite works of                       the Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus. They will guide the orphans with paternal                                                               136","and affectionate care for their sound education and suitable instruction, providing                       them with what they need, especially in case of illness. They will consider the last                       of the orphans as the first of the Fathers (Regole della Pia Congregazione dei                        Rogazionisti del Cuore di Gesù, November 9, 1914).                               Since this Pious Work is dedicated to the salvation of children, I will strive,                       insofar as Holy Obedience allows me, with every effort for the good of intern and                       extern children. In my heart, I will ardently desire the salvation of all the children                       of the world, and I will ask for it with ardent prayers to the Most Holy Hearts of                       Jesus and Mary.                               Saving the tender children is holiest among all holy works. Therefore, we                       will look after them with every sacrifice and, filled with a spirit of intelligence,                       we do the highest good by plucking the children from wandering, from dangers,                       from perversion, in order to lead them to education and instruction to make of                       them good Christians, perfect Catholics, honest and hard-working citizens, and                       one  day,  good  parents,  if  God  so  destine  them  (Draft  Constitutions  of  the                       Rogationists, March 22, 1906).                               The children who are educated in the Christian way will live a good and                       holy life (AP, p. 606).                       These  passages  contain  a  summary  of  the  aims,  ways,  and  means,  which  were                extensively developed by Father Hannibal in the regulations he  wrote. They lay down the                commitment that must animate the Rogationist educator, whose action is aimed at the full                realization of the person, to offer the children the possibility of harmonious growth. In these                notes, there is not even room for the synthesis of a Rogationist pedagogy. We can only highlight                some elements that constitute and characterize it.                       Educational action must be:                        a. Religious: the student must understand, interiorize, and live the principles of faith to                trod the historical path and reach the destination for which he was created.                       b. Essential and existential: the child must build his existence through essential and                indispensable elements, love, solidarity, work, dignity, autonomy.                       c. Individual: each child has potentials, natural gifts, possible environmental, psychic,                and character conditionings.                       d. Finalized: the child must understand the fundamental importance of the ultimate goal,                which must guide the intermediate goals that historical situations will offer him.                        e. Cordial: expressed with sincere and impartial love, the educator must be able to make                the child perceive that he is truly in his heart.                       f. Intelligent and attentive: capable of entering the heart of the child, of discerning and                adopting the most appropriate interventions in the given moment.                       g. Respectful: the Rogationist educator must take to the supernatural level the maxim                of  the  poet  Giovenale:  máxima  debetur  puero  reverentia.  [The  child  deserves  the  highest                respect].                       h. Above all, exemplary: Father Hannibal said that the educator must be a perfect model,                kind, exemplary, but firm in his decisions.                                                                  137","31.4. The Orphanages do not exclude other types of charitable works                        The Founder's choice to institutionalize orphanages does not exclude other types of                charitable works. The desire to help all those in need, with every possible means, through the                corporal and spiritual works of mercy, had a 360-degree opening. Unfortunately, the limitations                and historical conditions in which the Founder found himself did not allow him to actualize the                plans of good works that the love of God and neighbor inspired him: he had to face the lack of                collaborators, means, and places. But his perspectives were quite different: The salvation of                abandoned orphans will be one of the favorite works of the Rogationists (AP, p. 607). So far,                these  Works  are  two:  the  education  and  salvation  of  abandoned  orphans,  and  the                evangelization  and  help  of  the  most  miserable  and  destitute  poor  (Regole  della  Pia                Congregazione dei Rogazionisti del Cuore di Gesù, November 9, 1914).                                …  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  according  to  the  possibility  -  which                       depends first of all on the number of sisters suitable in every respect and for the                       different works - can open orphanages, preferably nurseries for children, shelters                       for the poor, hospitals, arts and trade schoosl, and any foundation of charity for                       interns or externs, boarding schools, retirement homes, schools at different levels,                       with primary, secondary or high schools (Regolamento per le Figlie del Divino                       Zelo del Cuore di Gesù, December 15, 1920).                                                                                *                31.5. Apostolate of assistance and evangelization of the poor                       Even if this type of apostolate is not standardized, each community has always come,                more or less generously, to the aid of the poor either by means of food, money, or direct service                of Rogationists religious who, following the example of the Founder, work in environments                where poverty is overtaken by misery, like that of the Avignone Quarter.                        In the Philippines, in Manila, the Inserted Community of Pasay, made up of a group of                young religious lives in the squatter areas, trying to help the needs of those unfortunate people                marginalized by the society. In Cebu, the Rogationists built the Avignone Clinic to provide                medical assistance to the poor of the area.                        In Brazil, in São Paulo, the Rogationists started the Albergue Zancone, open all day for                about 150 poor people who find food, sleeping areas, and medical assistance there. In the                favelas of the same city, they offer all possible services to the marginalized. In Curitiba, there                is the Obra Social San Aníbal (OSSA). In addition to the assistance of children and adolescents,                the  Rogationists  have  set  up  the  Casa  da  Paz,  a  multifunctional  center  for  meetings  and                financial support for about a hundred poor people. In Passos, the Centro Padre José Leo assists                approximately one hundred people. Presidente Jànio Quadros has a Human Promotion Center                for more than six hundred people.                       Also,  in  the  USA  in  Sanger,  the  Rogationists  opened  the  Hannibal  House,  where                Mexican migrants find food and clothing; in Van Nuys, the SERV Center develops welfare                activities for the poor.                       In Africa, in Nyanza, in the St. Antoine Social Center, the Mwigira Ubwoba program                provides support and training to some sixty families with children suffering from AIDS.                   * EN: The Author wrote these notes in 2010. Since then, situations have changed. Some works were reorganized                or  discontinued,  while  many  new  expressions  of  the  apostolate  of  charity  by  the  Rogationists  have  been                introduced. It would be good to give an update of the situation in case this book will be used as a text in formation                houses, such as the novitiate for example.                                                              138","In  Albania,  in  Shenkoll,  a  polymedic  outpatient  clinic  treats  the  most  indigent.  In                Poland, in Warsaw, there is a daily soup kitchen (except Sunday) for the poor.                       In recent years, various communities have put up the soup kitchen for the poor: in                Messina, the Christ the King Institute offers a lunch for more than sixty poor people every day,                and these days, some areas are being renovated to set up toilets and shower rooms, and sleeping                quarters; the Mother House provides dinner for more than ninety poor people every day; in                Rome, the Istituto Antoniano serves food three times a week to about two hundred and eighty                poor people. In these soup kitchens, the Religious are assisted by volunteers.                       In Desenzano del Garda, about thirty poor people receive food every day; in Padua,                there is a temporary shelter for about ten homeless people.                  31.6. The Constitutions and the tradition                                                                             *                       Since its first edition in 1926 to the lastest one in 1998,  the Constitutions have always                confirmed and established in the vows the Founder’s fundamental intention concerning the                apostolate of charity in service to the little ones and the poor.                        The history of the Congregation, since the beginning, attests to the understanding and                acceptance that the Congregation has had of the apostolate of charity according to the intentions                of the Founder. This service was offered with absolute constancy, without interruption, even                in the most challenging times of the two World Wars, despite the risks, dangers, and serious                difficulties. The General and Provincial Chapters, the circular letters of the Superiors General,                the Norms, Ratio, study conferences, educational projects, programs of the Circumscriptions,                the  sacrifice  expressed  even  in  difficult  situations  by  religious  educators,  the  care  in  the                selection and formation of lay collaborators, and the millions of money spent for upgrading the                structures – all these are proofs that the apostolate of charity is a constitutional and essential                commitment of our charism.                  31.7. Faithfulness to charitable works                       The constitutional and charismatic commitment of our specific charitable mission must                be  faithfully  safeguarded  and  perpetually  carried  out,  with  a  dynamism  that  respects  the                original spirit and intentions of Father Hannibal and the magisterium of the Church: The works                need to be renewed and revitalized. But this must be done while remaining faithful to the                approved apostolate of the institute and in  collaboration with the respective ecclesiastical                authorities (EE 25).                        Material fidelity alone to the works of the past, rather than to the original intentions of                the Founder, fossilizes these Works and creates a risky indifference and discouragement among                those working in the field. The charism is a living and fluid reality. It reaches out, opens, and                is embodied in ever-new perspectives and situations, which demand our commitment to update                and require the spirit of creativity and boldness in the prudent search for initiatives. Structures,                instruments, programs, activities, typologies need to be reworked based on cultures, laws, and                historical conditions. Therefore, they are subject to changes and adaptations, which should be                in compliance with the regulations in force in the countries where we operate, and insofar as                they do not prohibit us from expressing our service according to the religious principles and                pedagogical methods left to us by Father Hannibal and tested in time.                    EN: The Constitutions currently in force is that of the 2010 edition. The apostolate of charity is placed in the                *                section dedicated to the Mission, in arts. 69-72.                                                              139","The General Chapter of 1980 suggests abandoning places and Works, as a last resort,                that is, in the absolute impossibility of expressing our service of charity in faithfulness to the                constitutional “spirit.”                                In planning its works, may the Congregation allow itself to be guided by                       evangelical freedom of spirit; may it also be willing to leave places and works,                       which no longer respond to the original decision. On the other hand, may it be                       always ready to offer its contribution in the field of educational assistance in other                       places or countries, where it seems to be more needed and urgent (Apostolate, n.                       60).                       Currently, concerning the apostolate of assistance and education for the needy little                ones, the range of typologies varies according to the socio-economic realities and laws of the                countries  where  the  Rogationists  and  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  operate.  They  have                institutes with residential activities, day-care centers, hostels, schools of all levels. We can                mention the following schools: in Brasilia, with about two thousand pupils and a college with                two hundred students; that of Silang, in the Philippines, which operates an educational institute                with one hundred and twelve intern boys and the Rogationist College with vocational training                courses, frequented by about two thousand youth. A school with more than eight hundred                students is also active in Campana, Argentina.                       For some years now, in Italy, our apostolate of charity at the service of the little ones                has been conditioned by government laws, which do not allow us to express educational action                in complete freedom. The formula “Famiglie insieme Volunteer Association” adopted by the                Rogationists community of Oria seems to give good prospects.                       An uncharacteristic activity as compared to the traditional ones was started in 1994, to                help  children  and  families  in  need.  The  distant  adoption  had  a  remarkable  development,                especially  in  favor  of  some  three  thousand  children  in  India  with  the  program  of  school                education and the construction of some houses for needy families.                                                                                                      140","32. Obedience to the Rogate                         There is no doubt that all the members of the Congregation of the Rogationists as a                whole, and each religious in particular, are obliged to express the apostolate of the Rogate in                the terms desired by the Founder and authorized by the competent ecclesiastical authority, as                noted in the fourth vow: to pray-to zeal-to be good laborers.                        The three activities are fundamentally integrated into one and constitute the apostolate                of the Rogationist (cf. above, in 21). Therefore, all the Rogationists, from those who have just                made their first profession, to the elderly who are no longer able to carry out the apostolate in                practice, are required to express the three dimensions, unless they no longer have the capacity                to understand and to want.                        Each Rogationist, in fact, freely, knowingly, and conscientiously made the fourth vow,                and bound himself with a firm will and total availability to the fulfillment of the three activities                of the one apostolate, without excluding any of them. The Spirit, in fact, together with the                charism, plants in our being the seed that contains the potentialities and attitudes to carry out                the  singular  mission  of the  Rogate,  according  to  the  understanding  of  the  Founder  and  in                relation to the physical and psychological conditions of each religious. We pose ourselves this                question: how can the Rogationist with a particular role in the community, express at the same                time and place the three activities prescribed by the Constitutions?                       Concerning  prayer,  the  problem  is  not  raised  at  all,  because  despite  the  precarious                conditions  and  limitations  of  the  religious,  he  can  always  pray,  everywhere  and  despite                everything, offer his sufferings as a holocaust in fulfillment of the fourth vow. Moreover, the                only institutional charism is the active and unifying principle of the life and action of each and                every one of those consecrated to the Rogate as a whole.                                This corporate mission does not mean that all the members of the Institute                       do  the  same  things  or  that  the  gifts  and  qualities  of  the  individual  are  not                       respected. It does means that the works of all the members are directly related to                       the  common  apostolate,  which  the  Church  has  recognized  as  expressing                       concretely the purpose of the Institute (EE 25).                       As in the human body, the members are many, and, although they exercise different                functions, all tend to the good and growth of the single organism (cf. 1 Cor 12:12), so each                religious, whatever the role assigned to him by obedience and expressed in the Congregation,                he  goes  beyond  the  boundaries  his  uniqueness  to  be  grafted  in  the  one  specific  apostolic                activity.                        However, it must be remembered that the concrete realization of any of the three forms                of apostolate could be limited or even made impossible due to internal or external factors. In                this case, if it would not be possible to act on one or the other of the three dimensions in                practice, it is always possible to carry out all three dimensions virtually, at the same time, in a                consistent and stable manner. This is provided that  the Rogationist, in his every action, is                animated by the right charismatic intention (the intention, in fact, defines and qualifies the                action towards its end). All his works, therefore, must be animated by a sincere and deep desire:                       a) that the Lord send good laborers;                        b) that this spirit of prayer be spread throughout the Church;                       c) that the abandoned little ones and the poor be assisted and provided in their temporal                and spiritual needs.                                                                141","In  addition,  the  Rogationist  must  demonstrate  a  lively,  sincere,  and  unconditional                willingness to relinquish his current role, though gratifying, and eventually its office, for a                different assignment, or to transfer to any community, even abroad. Obviously, he can present                possible and real impediments to the Superior. In a Regulation of the Daughters of Divine Zeal,                                                                                                34                the Founder demonstrated an exceptional rigor regarding the transfers of religious.                       Any role must be exercised in the spirit of obedience, sacrifice, and with a good dose                of faith in the words of Jesus: Without me, you can do nothing, with the certainty that with Him                we can do everything that is commanded to us, even in the paradoxical situation of absolute                impossibility to act. Christ, in fact, saved the world by being nailed on the cross. In the post-                conciliar exhortation VC, John Paul II highlights the superiority of the apostolate of being over                that of acting, when he affirms:                                The sense of mission is at the very heart of every form of consecrated life                       […] (VC, 25).                                Indeed, more than in external works, the mission consists of making Christ                       present  to  the  world  through  personal  witness.  […]  Thus,  it  can  be  said  that                       consecrated persons are “in  mission” by virtue of  their  very consecration, to                       which they bear witness in accordance with the ideal of their Institute (VC, 72).                       We can call this type of mission, which is intrinsic to consecrated life, the mission of                being and not of doing because it is a mission of witnessing, by living day by day according to                one’s charism.                               Consecrated  persons  will  be  missionaries  above  all  by  continually                       deepening their awareness of having been called and chosen by God, to whom                       they must therefore direct and offer everything that they are and have, freeing                       themselves from the obstacles which could hinder the totality of their response                       (VC, 25).                        Finally, we are all convinced by the striking and inescapable conclusion: At the end of                life, the apostolate will be, for many a mission of prayer and suffering only (EE 26).                        Let us conclude this chapter with the exhortations from our Founder, which summarizes                the role and duty to express the fourth vow with ever active, growing, and joyous zeal for the                glory of God and the salvation of souls:                                The zeal for this daily prayer will always be alive and increasing (AR, p.                       467).                                For the Daughters of Divine Zeal, obedience to the divine command forms                       the favorite joy of their heart, the central part of their vocation, their mission, and                       their glorious predestination (AR, p. 467).                                The zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of souls is predominant in                       all the Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus; their mission is to implore from the Most                       Holy Heart of Jesus, the good laborers for the Holy Church (AR, p. 466).                     34  What sin does the Sister commit when she opposes her transfer? The Sister, by virtue of the vow of obedience,                is obliged to obey under mortal sin in serious matters, or when imposed by the Superior with the formula: by                virtue of Holy Obedience, by the vow you have, etc. Thus, the transfer from one House to another is a serious                matter, and not wanting to obey is a mortal sin! (Regulation for the Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart of                Jesus, December 15, 1920).                                                              142","143","33. The spirituality of the Rogationists and the Daughters of                                      Divine Zeal flows from the Rogate                          Man  can  guide  his  own  life  according  to  two  fundamental  options.  The  first                fundamental option is to live according to the Spirit; this is the option of the spiritual man, who                lets himself be animated and guided by the Spirit in all his choices, inner attitudes, and actions.                His is an existence in the Spirit.                       The second option is that of the man who lives according to the flesh, that is, of the one                who orients his life according to the standards of the world. His is a purely earthly existence.                His interests are only time-bound; he organizes his life according to a trajectory that disregards                God and encloses his existence within the confines of time and space.                        We are interested in the first option, which is the one chosen by Jesus Christ in his                earthly life.                       Christ was conceived by working of the Holy Spirit; in baptism in the Jordan, God                anointed him with the Holy Spirit and power (cf. Acts 10:38); he let himself to be led into the                desert by the Spirit (cf. Mk 1:12); he went to Galilee with the power of the Spirit (cf. Lk 4:14);                he rejoiced in the Spirit (cf. Lk 10:21); he was aware that the Spirit was upon him to proclaim                and carry out the salvation of man (Lk 4, 16 ff.). In the Gospel of John, we read that from his                fullness we have all received, grace upon grace (Jn 1:16; Col 2, 9-10).                       Saint Irenaeus affirms: The Spirit of God descended upon Jesus and anointed him, […]                so that we, receiving from the abundance of his anointing, might be saved (Irenaeus, Adv. Her.                III, 9, 3). The same Spirit flows in Jesus Christ and in us, like the sap that flows in the vine and                in the branches. And Saint Paul:                                But it is God who establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned                        us; he has put his seal upon us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.                       (2 Cor 1: 21-22).                                To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good                       (1 Cor 12: 7).                                Now, here are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; there are varieties of                       service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of workings, but it is the same                       God who inspires them all in everyone. To each is given the manifestation of the                       Spirit for the common good (1 Cor 12:4-7).                                                                                *                       Hence, the theology of the spirituality of the states of life:                       a) lay: incarnated-fundamental;                        b) religious: transcendent-eschatological;                       c) priestly: transcendent-mediatory.                       A fairly complete definition of spirituality is found in the final document of the General                Chapter of 1980. In no. 125, we read:                        EN:  The  Author  coins  terminologies  that  are  difficult  to  translate:  a)  laico:  incarnata-ricapitolatrice;  b)                *                religioso: trascendente-escatologica; c) sacerdotale: trascendente-mediatrice.                                                              144","Spirituality is the way how a member of the Mystical Body of Christ, after                       the impulse of the Holy Spirit, conceives and actualizes his relationship with God                       in Christ, and the particular way of life with which he relates to his brethren and                       the cosmic realities, in the concrete situations in which he finds himself.                        From this definition, we can observe that spirituality is not an abstraction or an intimate                feeling, but that it envelops man in his totality, soul and body, being and acting. Therefore, one                of the essential notes of spirituality is not only interiority but also visibility. Spirituality draws                its origin from the charism.                               The charism is the fundamental criterion that defines and characterizes                       the spirituality of the founders and the religious Institutes. In fact, it is like the                       synthesis of all the spiritual and social data of each religious family. It is the                       central  point  that,  with  its  luminosity,  almost  visualizes  and  differentiates  the                       inner and outer profile of the various Institutes and specifies their apostolate (DC                       126).                  33.1. Note on visibility                       The charism is made visible through spirituality, which characterizes and qualifies the                actions of the person, giving it a particular style of life and apostolate. In fact, the charism, as                an invisible gift, remains buried in the depths of being, and is made visible in the structure of                the Institute, in the spiritual features and the dynamic presence of the religious; in other words,                spirituality is the epiphany of the charism.                        Furthermore, the charism on the part of the Spirit, who gives it as a gift. In other words,                it highlights the action of the Spirit, which makes the person perceive the specific call.                       Spirituality is on the part of the man, who receives the gift and responds to the vocation                by accepting God’s plan.                  33.2. Visibility of the Rogate, from a vocational perspective                       The Rogationist, who makes the Rogate visible, offers young people the most effective                vocational proposal— on the condition that he offers it in an authentic and joyful, attractive                and engaging manner to young people, who are looking for the ambiance where to achieve                fulfillment of living a happy life. The document Starting afresh from Christ no. 16 states: The                master plan of vocational promotion to consecrated life is that which the Lord himself began                when he said to the apostles, John and Andrew, “Come and see” (Jn 1:39).                       A joyful witness to the Rogate is the Religious who:                        a) reveals the presence of the Other and makes the face of the Christ of the Rogate                visible, at the highest level;                        b) lives what he believes, to the point of committing his own life for it. If coherence is                lacking, witnessing is lacking.                       Witnessing is the best way to tell the truth to others: it is enormously effective, because                he does not present value through a doctrinal demonstration, instead he shows it incarnated in                his life. Witnessing becomes a generator of vocations because it makes it possible to attract                                                                    145","attention  in  a  compelling  and  convincing  way.  This  explains  the  ever-growing  vocational                                                             35                success in the Congregation of Mother Teresa.                       We know well how much Father Hannibal insists on the fundamental requirement of                witnessing, primarily through our relational behaviors. In this regard, he has expressions that                are both original and effective. Among others, he says: Our Lord, in His infinite goodness,                wanted to engrave on the forehead of this nascent Work that divine Word, which lay buried for                many centuries in the Gospel: “Rogate, etc.” (AR, p. 73).                        Engraving on the forehead does not mean wearing it like some kind of tattoo. Father                Hannibal wants the Rogationist to be the epiphany and visibility of Christ of the Rogate, to be                an effective sign, capable of proclaiming the Rogate with life, of infecting others with the same                charismatic  interest,  of  sensitizing  and  empowering  the  faithful  to  the  duty  to  obey  the                command of Christ. And this goes beyond the signs that he wanted put on their habits (the                emblem of the Sacred Heart with the words of the Rogate). In other words, the Rogationist                must be “the sacrament of his charism”, always and everywhere.                  33.3. Note on Interiority                       If our Founder demanded outward signs, much more he demanded the reality behind                the signs. Behaviors, expressiveness, observance of the rule, etc. are words that refer to the                surface of the person and can remain distant, or even extraneous to the essential. The signs, the                behaviors,  are  authentic,  insofar  as  they  are  animated  by  deep  conviction  and  become  a                manifestation of a deeply rooted and existentially felt and lived values.                        The teachings and exhortations of Father Hannibal on the role that interiority plays in                the journey of perfection are remarkable. With impressive frequency, he insists on the need for                inner virtue and right intention:                                The regulation gives nothing but the rules for regulating external actions,                       but good exterior deportment is of little value if it is not accompanied from within.                       The aspirant must first place have the right and pure intention of seeking no other                       than his sanctification, for the pure glory of God and the good of souls. He must                       walk in the presence of God. He should have Jesus Christ in his mind, in his heart,                       in his actions, in his words, and in his aspirations. To strive to be all of Jesus: this                       is the purpose of his existence (Regolamento per Aspiranti Rogazionisti, 1906).                               External virtue and observance cannot be sustained for long if the inner                       virtue is lacking. Each consecrated person will strive to have an interior union                       with God. He will try to always be in the divine presence and to please God alone                       in everything and for everything. For inner virtue, it is necessary, first of all, the                       right intention: to do everything for Jesus, not to desire anything else but God                       alone  (Regole  per  la  Pia  Congregazione  dei  Rogazionisti  del  Cuore  di  Gesù,                       November 9, 1914).                       The lack of interior life makes even the most attractive ascetic, devotional, and liturgical                gestures hypocritical and pharisaic because they are not suggested by evangelical motivations;                they are not dictated by the Spirit, but by factors of a social nature, or for the pleasure of                narcissistic gratifications.

Eucharistic spirituality of the Rogationists                         Charism is the source of spirituality, and in as much as each religious Institute  has its                proper charism, so each has its own spirituality. The Constitutions of the Rogationists affirm it                unequivocally: The spirit of the Institute springs from its charism, which is the understanding                and zeal of the Rogate, from which the spiritual and temporal mercy towards the neighbor, in                accordance with the thought of the Founder, are a legitimate and immediate consequence                                              *                (Constitutions of 1980, Art. 9).                       What is the spirituality of the Rogationists? The whole life of the Rogationists should                be animated by the Eucharistic Mystery in which they realize the offering of their lives with                Christ to the Father and unite themselves to Him in the most perfect way (Constitutions of                1980, Art. 94).                        For the reasons repeatedly highlighted in these pages, ours is an eminently Eucharistic                spirituality. Here we wish to recall only one date, the most significant in the past, present, and                                                         st                future history of the Congregation: July 1 , which marks the founding memorial event of the                Congregations of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.

Here his priestly ministry and the gift                      of the understanding and zeal for the word of Jesus: The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. Pray                      therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest (Mt. 9:37-38, Lk. 10:2), found the                      fertile soil where to blossom and produce abundant fruit: the little ones and the poor are evangelized, and                       their prayer is  raised to  the Lord of  the harvest.  From  ‘Avignone’, as  a  small  caravan, our  religious                      Congregation started its journey in the Church and in the world.                      2010 Constitutions, Art. 13: “The Eucharistic Life”: We recognize that the Eucharist is the sacrament in                      which Christ perpetuates  his consecration  to the Father for the salvation of humankind. We believe that                        it contains the whole spiritual good of the Church. Here we find all the loving center of life and the source of                       our spirituality.  The Eucharist is where we invoke the gift of good laborers more effectively; it gives form,                      pace,  and development to all our activities. We live the daily celebration of the Eucharist as the central                      moment of  the  day and  commit ourselves to adore the Blessed Sacrament in which Christ has made his                      dwelling among us.                                                             148","moment  should  be  a  space  reserved  exclusively  for  immersion  into  our  Eucharistic                           36                spirituality.

Dimensions of the Eucharistic Spirituality                           The  main  connotations  of  the  Eucharistic  spirituality  of  the  Rogationists  and  the                Daughters of Divine Zeal are two: Paschal and Agape.                               The Spirit of this Institute of the Evangelical Rogation is none other than                       the Spirit of Zeal, Charity, and Sacrifice, manifested by our Lord Jesus Christ in                       his mortal life and recorded in the Holy Gospels. However, this zeal, charity, and                       sacrifice must be based on the humility and meekness of the Most Holy Heart of                       Jesus, proposed by our Lord Jesus Christ himself to be imitated (Punti di Regola                       in Scritti, vol. 3, p. 113).                        With  this  affirmation,  Father  Hannibal  highlights  the  essential  features  of  the                Eucharistic spirituality of his Institutes: charity and sacrifice (Agape and Paschal dimensions).                The Eucharistic language is typically sacrificial: priest, sacrifice, holocaust, victim, oblation,                offering are terms that find their full realization in Christ, whose bloodless sacrifice in the                Eucharist is connected to the bloody sacrifice of the cross. A disciple is not above his teacher                (Mt 10:24). The teacher is Christ, who humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even                death on a cross. Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name, which                is above every name (Phil 2: 8-9). To the Christians of Rome - but much more to those who are                called to follow Jesus Christ in evangelical radicality - Saint Paul sends a warm exhortation:  I                appeal to you, therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living                sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship (Rom 12:1).                        The Second Vatican Council indicates the most significant moment of this offering in                the celebration of the Eucharist: Taking part in the eucharistic sacrifice, the source and summit                of the Christian life, they (= the faithful) offer the divine victim to God and themselves along                with it (LG 11). In fact, in the Eucharistic prayers, we turn to the Father to send the Holy Spirit                so that He may transform us into a holy and living sacrifice.                         The religious, in total self-surrender, must surpass the laity. In the Lumen Gentium, we                read  that  the  project  of  consecration  makes  the  baptismal  commitments  radical:  pressius,                intimius, plenius [more closely, more intimately, more fully] (50, 44, 42). The being (= esse)                or proprium of religious life consists of this becoming more that makes Christ’s followers, who                accepted his call, perfect. It is the logic of the grain of wheat.                         The Rogationist, a man of the Eucharist, defines himself with it, and cannot fail to feel                the inner demand to live his religious consecration in a state of sacrificial tension. He finds his                spiritual identity in the Eucharistic sacrifice; it marks his existence, carries out his vocational                project, reaches the maximum actuality of his being.                         The Eucharistic configuration and conformation, to which our Constitutions exhorts us,                has been fully realized, for what is possible on this earth, by our Founder. The General Chapter                of 1980 highlights the Eucharistic aspect that qualifies the life of Father Hannibal with these                words:  It  is  of  extreme  interest  to  note  the  ascetic  commitment  that  always  animated  the                Founder in his continuous effort to imitate Christ, the priest on the altar of sacrifice (DC 121).                        The altar of sacrifice to which our Holy Founder ascended every day was the Avignone                Quarter. We know the sufferings of the Father and the courage he had in facing the difficulties                of its beginnings. In addition to the catastrophic situation of the place, of which we have already                spoken (cf. above, 13, note 10), his charity in service to the least and poor was tested many                                                                  150","times. He often had to contend with unmanageable, unruly boys, resistant to any educational                intervention.                        To Tomasso Cannizzaro he wrote:                                My  dearest  professor,  if  I  did  not  love  Jesus  Christ,  I  would  soon  be                       annoyed by staying in the midst of the most abject poor, and depriving myself of                       everything, and by losing sleep and quiet for the poor and the children (MB I, p.                            37                       343).                        The same Chapter affirms that                                the specific Eucharistic spirituality of the Rogationists places them in a                       life of worship and of carrying out the sacrifice of Christ (DC, 124).                        In the Constitutions (= of 1980) we read:                               The Religious Profession united with the Eucharistic sacrifice means the                       immolation  with  Jesus  Christ  in  a  sacrifice  without  reserve.  Meantime,  the                       Rogationists should do all in their power to persevere and greatly excel in the                       vocation to their Institute (Constitutions of 1980, Art. 25).                               Let all Rogationists, in union with Jesus Crucified, practice generously,                       both exterior and interior. Evangelical self-denial, to help to follow Christ, should                       lead them primarily to receive from and offer to the Heavenly Father the exercise                       of  holy  vows,  the  demands  of  life  in  common,  the  regular  observance,  the                       inevitable  sufferings  of  the  body  and  soul,  and  the  hardships  of  daily  duties                       (Constitutions of 1980, Art. 107).                        The Constitutions do not suggest discipline using knotted lashes, iron chains, fasting,                and the like, but in the first place, the spirituality of the specific charism is expressed with                charity, zeal, sacrifice, which are associated terms. Indeed, without charity, sacrifice is a useless                suffering, and without sacrifice, charity does not reach the heights of zeal for the glory of God                and the salvation of souls.                                The spirit of sacrifice is an immediate consequence of true zeal, and it must                       be  the  spirit  of  every  member  of  this  least  Congregation.  With  this  spirit  of                       sacrifice, the Rogationist of the Heart of Jesus will not spare anything for the glory                       of God and the good of souls but will embrace fatigue, deprivation, suffering,                       inconvenience. He will  endure contradictions,  humiliations,  and everything so                       that he could sacrifice his time, his rest, his tranquility, his health, and all himself,                       for  the  salvation  of  even  a  single  soul  (Regole  della  Pia  Congregazione  dei                       Rogazionisti del Cuore di Gesù, November 9, 1914).                      37  It is simply overwhelming what Father Hannibal wrote to Father Celona on January 8, 1919: […] I felt impelled                by the divine ineffable goodness of the Heart of Jesus, to throw myself into the midst of the poor, in contact with                their filth and their insects ... and after I started the female community, I did not rest until the orphanage of the                repulsive and mischievous rascals began, who naturally disgusted me immensely, and they were for me many                years of continuous, indescribable suffering! But I felt that my spirit was restored with new strength and sacred                vigor.                   For Father Celona that superhuman transport that Father Hannibal had towards the poor people, who for him                were truly Jesus  Christ, was  the fruit of heroic faith and ardent charity, earned from the Lord after having                overcome an immense disgust, with continuous and indescribable suffering, for so many years (MB I, p. 373).                                                               151","Father Hannibal, in a Regulation written for the novices of the Daughters of Divine                Zeal in 1909, confirms with striking words the demand for sacrifice as an imperative that has                its reason rooted in the consecration to the Rogate.                                The Novices of this least Congregation must consider the Novitiate as the                       time of their interior death. They must enter like those condemned to die, led to a                       scaffold of justice in which their passions are mystically executed and shed the                       blood of tears, mortifications, and sufferings. The most holy Cross of their beloved                       Crucified Spouse will be for them the mystical scaffold […] from the first entry                       into  this  holy  Novitiate  they  offer  themselves  spontaneously  as  victims  of  the                       Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus […]. This is indeed what the Sisters of this least                       Congregation must be like on account of the august Name they bear as Daughters                       of Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus, and for the reason of the sublime mission of                       the Evangelical Rogation of the Heart of Jesus (Regole, in Scritti, vol. 5, p. 551).                         The word “victims” in this document is repeated seventeen times.                         Let us see some reasons that justify asceticism:                        a) the interior demand to conform to Jesus Christ, whose entire life, as the author of the                “Imitation of Christ”, says, was cross and martyrdom: Tota vita Christi crux fuit et martirium.                        b) Jesus Christ saved the world with the cross. The Rogationist, who asks the Lord for                priests for the salvation of the world, will be the most generous and most cheerful Cyrenean.                Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me (Mt                16:24; Mk 8:34; Lk 9:23).                        c)  To quell the rebellion of the flesh. For I know that nothing good dwells within me,                           that is, in my flesh. The can will what is right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the                           good I want, but I do the evil I do not want. […] Wretched man that I am! Who will                           deliver me from this body of death? (Rom 7:18 ff.) […] but I pommel my body and                           subdue it, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified. (1 Cor 9:27).                        Father Hannibal says: Prayer and mortification are two wings with which the soul flies                towards God (AP, pp. 761-765).                        God tested Abraham […] and said to him: Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom                you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering upon one of the                mountains of which I shall tell you (Gen 22: 1-2). The Rogationist must be willing to sacrifice                everything he is and everything he has, as well as everything he received from family, strangers,                from the Congregation (money, objects, paper, residence, etc.). For him, the “son” to offer is                his body, intelligence, will, capacity to love, to choose, etc.                        Blessed John XXIII says: Without discipline, there is no man; without penance, there                is no Christian.                         Only  an  intelligent  and  guided  asceticism  can  develop  the  energy  necessary  to                overcome the force of gravity exerted by the law of the flesh and go up the inclined plane where                the original sin has placed us. Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with                its passions and desires (Gal 5:24).                        Finally, the saints, and Saint Hannibal in particular, treated their body to protect their                chastity. However, we need not end with the death on the cross. The Paschal Mystery is a                mystery  of  resurrection  through  death.  It  is  a  path  that  leads  to  the  final  goal  of  eternal                happiness, today in hope, tomorrow in reality.                        For Don Tonino Bello:                                                               152","Sacrifice is part of our identity card; suffering is a mystery that transcends                       us and goes beyond us; it makes us most resemble Jesus Christ; our tears feed the                       river of redemption. On Golgotha, we are allowed only three hours of stop. After                       three hours, there will be the forced removal of all crosses. Calvary will never be                       sold as building land.                                                                                                                                             153","36. The Agape Dimension of the Eucharistic Spirituality                          We cannot speak of the agape dimension without listening to the prayer that Jesus raises                up to the Father, on the eve of his passion, before leaving this earth in his physical presence.                For all those who will be his, Jesus pleads to the Father that they all be one, ut unum sint:                               I do not pray these only, but also for those who believe in me through their word,                        that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also                        may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me (Jn 17:20-21).                       As you, Father, are in me and I in you. The life of communion in the Church and its                expressions find the highest analogy, foundation, and model in the dynamics of Trinitarian                love, in the communion of the three Divine Persons (cf. GS 24d). Jesus proposes the same                relationship, which he lives with the Father and the Spirit, as the form and measure of the                mutual relationship between the members of his mystical Body. He gives to those who follow                him the commandment, which he defines as his and new. This is my commandment, that you                love  one  another  as  I  have  loved  you  (Jn  15:12),  is  the  essential  characteristic  of  the                identification card of his disciples: By this all men will know that you are my disciples: if you                have love for one another (Jn 13:35). Consequently, in the Church, all members cannot but live                in communion and be in a relationship of pure love for one another.                 36.1 The Theological Reason for Communion in a Religious Community                        The theological reason for koinonia within the community is found in the divine agape.                In the Holy Trinity, each Person is a pure love relationship with the other. Our communion has                its foundation in the theological and ontological plane; as we were created in the image and                likeness of God, so we are children in the Son and partakers of the divine nature. In Gaudium                et Spes (24d), we read:                               Indeed, the Lord Jesus, when he prayed to the Father “that all may be one, as                        we are one” (Jn 17.21-22) opened up vistas closed to human reason, for He implied a                        certain likeness between the union of divine Persons and the unity of God’s children in                        truth and charity.                       Through the incarnation of the Word, the Creator enters into a relationship with the                creature, so that God and man are definitely and irreversibly inseparable. God cannot exist                                  *                without humanity.  The transcendence and the divide between God and man, in Christ, are                annulled by virtue of the hypostatic union. Furthermore, in the sacrament of baptism, Christ                assumes us ontologically in himself, as members of his body. It is the mystery of the Church,                the mystical Body of Christ.                       The  religious  community,  a  qualified  expression  of  the  Church,  before  being  a                functional, disciplinary, and apostolic community, is first of all communion (koinonía). In the                present order of Providence, union in Christ is the only koinonia, which derives precisely from                 * EN: This must be explained well along the lines of doctrine, lest it can be misunderstood. This assertion should                always be read in the context of the Incarnation of the Word. The necessity of humanity in God is divinely                presupposed in the very person of Jesus Christ. This is the reason why Mary is called the Mother of God since she                is the mother of the very person of Jesus Christ, in whom humanity and divinity are hypostatically united without                the confusion of natures.                                                              154","the  ontological  bond.  The  members  of  a  community,  including  those  who  constitute  the                Church, insofar  as they  structure and  regulate their being  together  and their working  with                external laws, are configured just like any society, for the fact that between them there is only                a juridical bond.                        Created in the image and likeness of God who is Love and partakers of the divine nature,                all  the  baptized,  and  in  particular  the  religious,  cannot  but  live  koinonia  as  a  creatural,                theological, ontological, and logical requirement.                        John Paul II, in his post-synodal exhortation Vita Consecrata, confirms this truth in                unequivocal terms:                                The Church is essentially a mystery of communion, “a people made one with the                        unity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit” (LG, 4). The fraternal life seeks to                        reflect the depth and richness of this mystery, taking shape as a human community in                        which the Trinity dwells, to extend in history the gifts of communion proper to the divine                        person (VC, 41).                       The human space inhabited by the Trinity cannot remain a prisoner within the walls of                the Institute but must project itself into the Church. In the same document, the Pope urges                religious to live koinonia as a testimony to be offered to the people of God, as an essential duty:                               Even fraternal life, whereby consecrated persons strive to live in Christ with                        “one heart and soul” (Acts 4:32), is put forward as an eloquent witness to the Trinity.                        It proclaims the Father, who desires to make all of humanity one family. It proclaims                        the  Incarnate  Son,  who  gathers  the  redeemed  into  unity,  pointing  the  way  by  his                        example,  his  prayer,  his  words,  and  above  all  his  death,  which  is  the  source  of                        reconciliation for a divided and scattered humanity. It proclaims the Holy Spirit as the                        principle of unity in the Church, wherein he ceaselessly raises spiritual families and                        fraternal communities (VC, 21).                  36.2. Charismatic Reasons for Eucharistic Spirituality                        There is no doubt that what is stated in this section is valid for all the baptized. However,                for the Rogationists, men of the Eucharist, it assumes a value of absolute radicality.                         The encounter between God and man in Christ in the Eucharistic communion reaches                the highest degree of fulfillment and the supreme perfection. Saint Paul affirms:                               The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of                       Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?                       Because there is one bread, we, who are many are one body, for we all partake of                       the one bread (1 Cor. 10:16-17).                         The Eucharist, uniting us all to Christ in sacramental communion, also unites us among                ourselves and exalts the supernatural nature of koinonia to the highest level. Jesus, during the                Last Supper, in that Cenacle of the Eucharist and the priesthood, just before handing himself                to the executioners, hands himself over to his disciples: Take and eat all of you: this is my Body,                to be given up for you. With these words, Jesus not only offers his body to his Father as a                sacrifice for our sake but gives himself to us as bread, to make us one with him, to transform                us into him, and live in communion with him.                       After having mentioned the theological reasons, it is only right and useful to highlight                the charismatic reasons for communion and the union of hearts. For the Rogationists, the value                of  koinonia  in  the  charismatic  dimension  finds  its  root  and  source  in  the  Rogate,  which                                                               155","historically marks the historical itinerary of inspiration, received in a Eucharistic context. The                Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal have the certainty that they were generated by                the Eucharist and that their spirituality is typically Eucharistic. Therefore, living in a state of                communion  with  Christ  and  with  their  brothers,  they  live  the  essentials  of  their  specific                spirituality and return to the source of their consecration. On the contrary, if koinonia is not                lived in Rogationist communities, the Eucharistic presence itself runs the risk of remaining an                abstraction at a charismatic, existential, and ministerial level. The command of reciprocal love,                which Jesus entrusts to the apostles at the Last Supper (This is my commandment: that you love                one another) is an essential condition to be faithful to the command of the One who chose and                constituted us to bring the good news of the Rogate. John Paul II recalls the teaching of Saint                John Chrysostom:                                The Eucharistic Sacrifice is intrinsically directed to the inward union of the                        faithful with Christ through communion; we receive the very One who offered himself                        for us (EdE 16).                                Saint  John  Chrysostom’s  commentary  on  these  words  is  profound  and                        perceptive: “For what is the bread? It is the body of Christ. And what do those who                        receive it become? The Body of Christ (EdE 23).                                The Eucharist creates communion and fosters communion (EdE 40).                               Saint Augustine effectively echoed this  call when, in  recalling  the Apostle’s                        words: “You are the body of Christ and individually members of it (2Cor. 12:27); he                        went on to say: “If you are his body and members of him, then you will find set on the                        Lord’s table your own mystery. Yes, you receive your own mystery (EdE 40).                         The Eucharist creates communion inasmuch as Christ himself unites his members to                himself in such an intimate way, making himself the bond of communion. Therefore, he who                does  not  live  koinonia  destroys  the  work  of  the  Word  who  was  incarnated  by  mutual                immanence, which is not only personal, but above all communitarian: Abide in me, and I in                you (Jn 15:4).                        In the Eucharistic liturgy, we invoke the Spirit to bring about this communion with                Christ: so that, nourished by the Body and Blood of your Son and filled with his Holy Spirit, we                may become one body, one spirit in Christ (Eucharistic Prayer III).                        It is always the Holy Spirit that brings about this union:                               The same Christ who called them, daily calls together his brothers and sisters                        to speak with them and to unite them to himself and to each other in the Eucharist, to                        assimilate them increasingly into His living and visible Body, in whom the Spirit lives,                        on a journey towards the Father (FLC, 12).                        The  document,  Eucharist,  Communion,  and  Community  (ECC)    *   has  extremely                significant expressions:                               The Eucharist is the force that forms the community and increases its capability                        to love: it makes it a welcoming home for all, the village fountain that offers its spring                        water to all, as Pope John loved to say. In it every diversity turns into harmony, every                        pleading  voice  is  heard,  every  need  finds  someone  who  bends  over  it  with  love.                        Encounter, dialogue, openness, and celebration are its characteristic notes (ECC, 28).                     EN: Conferenza Episcopale Italiana, Eucaristia, communion e communità. Documento Pastorale dell’Episcopato                *                Italiano, EDB, Bologna, 1983.                                                              156","The Apostolic Exhortation Vita Consecrata reads: In the celebration of the mystery of                the Lord’s Body and Blood, the unity and charity of those who have consecrated their lives to                God are strengthened and increased (VC, 95).                         The Rogationist who celebrates or participates daily in the Eucharist cannot help but                relate with the confreres in the community in a Trinitarian way. However, the experience of                daily life confirms that this is not an easy path.                         This is also evident from the fact that all the formative literature of the Congregation,                the programs of ongoing formation, both in the central level and in every Circumscription, that                reaffirmed, not once but many times, and continues to reiterate the demand and the fundamental                need  for  fraternal  communion  so  that  the  life  of  consecration  becomes  authentic  and  the                apostolate effective.                        That it is not easy is also demonstrated by the persistent requests of superiors at all                levels,  through  circular  letters,  formal  and  informal  visits,  through  the  ongoing  formation                programs  of  the  Congregation,  and  of  the  various  Circumscriptions,  through  congresses,                assemblies, etc. The Chapter document Called to Stay with Him, while confirming that it is not                easy, asserts however that it brings joy, provided that a good intimate relationship is established                with  Him:  In  the  measure  in  which  we  Rogationists  are  able  to  stay  with  Him,  we  form                communities of brothers who are happy to live together. It is an ideal that is not easy to reach,                but towards which we are journeying. (no. 15).                         Furthermore,  it  is  necessary  to  remember  the  dynamism  of  the  charism  in  the                community, where all religious have:                        a)  a single charism that reaches the depths of our being and conforms us, in a similar                           way, to the Christ of the Rogate;                        b)  the same Founder;                         c)  the same vows;                        d)  the same Rule;                         e)  the same mission;                        f)  above all, the same chorus of prayer to the Lord of the harvest, to obtain holy priests,                           the announcers and ministers of the agape.                        We are well aware that neither the bond of blood, nor emotional affinity, nor friendship,                nor anything else that we can imagine, but rather the Rogate, welcomed and lived in the love                of God and brothers, constitutes the specific ontological bond that establishes and forms the                Rogationist community.                         Only  a  serious,  constant  personal  and  community  reflection  of  the  theological,                ontological,  and  charismatic  motivations,  which  are  at  the  roots  of  koinonia,  can  help  us                overcome the obstacles encountered in the work of building communities of communion. The                koinonia of the Rogationist community is not only a demand for authentic life or only a duty                of witnessing but a constitutive imperative of the apostolate in the field of the third dimension                of the fourth vow. It would be truly absurd to love the little ones and the poor, and to wash their                feet, while within the community, they trample on the feet of the confreres, create distances,                and are incapable of giving and receiving forgiveness. These are situations that, by our insertion                into the social sphere, may come to the knowledge of the outsiders, who expect from us the                witnessing  of  evangelical  koinonia.  Therefore,  it  is  evident  that  all  the  members  of  the                Congregation of Father Hannibal must consider the essential condition of having one heart and                                                                 157","one soul, in order to expand the agape in the service of charity in favor of the abandoned little                                                                           38                ones and poor, in which the Founder saw a second Eucharist.                               One thing is certain, that, to sanctify ourselves, a great means, a means                       taught  by  Our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  Himself  and  practiced  by  the  saints  and                       confirmed by the Holy Church, is to unite ourselves together, to share in holy                       charity, under one rule, in obedience, in poverty, in chastity. From this, from this                       union emerge countless advantages to correspond to the purposes of the Blessed                       God, to better fulfill the divine will, to do good to one’s self and others, and to                       sanctify and save oneself (AR, p. 60).                        We read in an authoritative document of the Magisterium a commentary to the thought                of our Founder:                               Above all, by the profession of the evangelical counsels, which frees one                       from what might be an obstacle to the fervor of charity, religious are communally                       a prophetic sign of intimate union with God, who is loved above all things.                               Furthermore, through the daily experience of communion of life, prayer,                       and apostolate – the essential and distinctive elements of their form of consecrated                       life – they are a sign of fraternal fellowship. In fact, in a world frequently very                       deeply divided and before their  brethren in  the faith, they give witness  to the                       possibility of a community of goods, of fraternal love, of the program of life and                       activity which is theirs because they have accepted the call to follow more closely                       and more freely Christ the Lord who was sent by the Father so that, firstborn                       among many brothers and sisters, he might establish a new fraternal fellowship                       in the gift of his Spirit  (RHP 24).                                                         38  Cf. G. CIRANNI, Eucaristia, Rogate e carità, in “Padre Annibale Oggi, n. 10 (Second Series), pp. 23-26.                                                              158","37. Agape-Rogate-Heart of Jesus                           The principle of eternal charity is the word emerging from the divine zeal of the Heart                                                               39                of Jesus: “Rogate ergo Dominum messis, ut ...”.                        This affirmation of Father Hannibal begins with the word “principle,” which draws our                attention because it is of clear biblical resonance. The term “principle/beginning” in the context                in which the Founder places it (draft of the 1906 Constitutions) means source, reason, cause,                and the like.                        Obviously,  Father  Hannibal  does  not  mean  that  eternal  charity  has  its  origin,  its                beginning, from the Rogate. It would be a theological absurdity. Eternal charity is not generated                by the Rogate. It is exactly the opposite: the Rogate, a charism with a high potential for love,                is  generated  by  the  eternal  charity  of  God  who  wants  everyone  to  be  saved  through  the                mediation especially of those who participated in the ministerial priesthood.                         Indeed, the solemn, poetic, and prophetic tone of the statement gives us the feeling of                leaping further in time; we almost seem to see the Rogate alongside the first word of the Bible                and the prologue of the Gospel  of John,  so  we can conclude, with  much boldness:  In the                beginning, there was the Rogate.                        This is also reflected in the final document of the General Chapter of 1986, Rogationist                Communion and Community, which projects the Rogate into the Trinitarian mystery, placing                it exactly in the Heart of Christ. Here are some passages of no. 24 of the said document:                        The Rogate has its origin in the Father.                         In the Rogate, Christ reveals his heart.                        The Rogate has its abode in the heart of Christ.                         The Rogate is in the heart of the Father; it is in the center of the life of God.                        In conclusion, the Rogate is love within the Trinity.                         These assertions are a faithful echo of the Founder's thought, which he confirms widely                in his writings.                                […]  The  great  word  out  of  the  divine  zeal  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus:                       “Rogate…” (Scritti, vol. 60, p. 53).                               That Word of Jesus Christ is a command of the zeal of his divine Heart                       (Regole della Pia Congregazione dei Rogazionisti del Cuore di Gesù, November                       9, 1914).                               Here is the great word, the divine command, which on the other hand                       could only flare up from the burning zeal that tormented the Most Holy Heart of                       Jesus; and, using the biblical word, this zeal devoured that divine Heart (“God                       and Neighbor”, June 1925, p. 13).                         It is Father Hannibal’s conviction that the Rogate has its origin and its abode in the                divine agape, which is historically manifested in the Eucharistic Heart of Christ, the icon and                     From the Draft of the Constitutions of the Rogationists of March 22, 1906. On this subject, cf. G. CIRANNI,                39                “Agape e Rogate”, in Studi Rogazionisti, 90 (July-Sept 2006), p. 95-129.                                                              159","theological locus where we contemplate the epiphany of divine love. Ut mittat, the objective                of the Evangelical Prayer, is the expression of the divine agape.                        Agape and mission, to love and to send, are inseparable words. With the sending, God-                Love  leaves  the  Trinitarian  borders;  he  sends  his  only  begotten  Son  to  incorporate  all  his                children into his love: For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son (Jn 3:16). The                same heavenly Father, for the same reason (of agape), through Christ, sends the apostles of                yesterday and today: As the Father has sent me, even so I send you (Jn 20:21).                         The agape from the Father is poured out to the Son, from the Son to the apostles and                their successors, and, through them, eternal charity bursts into the universe and radiates towards                everyone.                        “Rogate” and “agape” are essentially related words, and both occupy the infinite spaces                of the Heart of Jesus. It is obvious, therefore, that the Heart of Jesus, in the spirituality and the                initiatives of the Founder, envelops the Rogationist universe in all its fields.                        In the Declarations and Promises IV, Father Hannibal draws the fundamental line of                the rule of agape-life for himself and his followers, which must render the specific apostolate                of good laborers fruitful. He writes: I declare, that from these precepts of charity, I have formed                the  goal  of  my  entire  priestly  ministry  and  religious  life  in  this  Institute.  The  title  of  the                magazine “God and Neighbor” is emblematic and, at the same time, symbolic of the specific                Rogationist  mission.  On  the  occasion  of  its  publication  (June  26,  1908),  Father  Hannibal                addressed the Heart of Jesus with these words: O sweetest Heart, clearest mirror of purest                delight in its intimate essence, please receive into your gentlest fibers this periodical, which                has two purposes united as one: God and neighbor.                         Father Hannibal, indeed, an expert and original navigator in the infinite ocean of divine                love, received from the Spirit the inspiration to anchor his institutions to the Heart of Christ.                He  desired  the  name  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus  for  his  poor  children,  for  his  clerics,  for  the                Rogationists, for the Daughters of Divine Zeal, for the Evangelical Rogation, etc. Therefore, it                is not a simple superficial qualification, but rather an essential note that defines the agape                identity  of  the  persons  and  works  of  Father  Hannibal  and  a  fundamental  element  of  the                spirituality of the Rogationists.                         The former Superior General, Father Giorgio Nalin, highlighted this fact in the circular                letter of April 23, 2006, in which he writes that the Founder:                                (He) saw an intrinsic link between the Rogate and the Heart of Christ. The                       Rogate  itself  is  an  expression  of  the  compassionate  Heart  of  Christ.  Father                       Hannibal, who nourished his charismatic spirituality at the sources of the word                       of God, drew the true charity, that is the Rogate, from the “burning furnace” of                       the compassionate Heart of Jesus.                        The Word who was and is with God (cf. Jn 1: 1), although remaining always in this                eternal relationship of love, in order to fulfill the plan of salvation, he came to bring to earth                the fire that will keep on burning (cf. Lk 12, 49). The fire of divine love that we contemplate                in the burning furnace of the Heart of Christ, from where priests and apostles, the bearers and                “vestals” of this fire, come out. Father Hannibal speaks of this in the first prayer to obtain good                laborers: O Jesus, open your Divine Heart and may good and holy laborers to your Church                come out from it. Yes, draw them from the depths of your Sacred Heart.                                                                   160","37.1 The Rogate is the principle of eternal charity because the priest is a mystery of love                        If the spirituality of the priest is essentially formed by the configuration to Christ, the                icon of the Father's merciful love, the priest cannot but be himself that mystery of love, which                is shared with him with the sacrament of Holy Orders. John Paul II recalls:                                Live the mystery that has been placed in your hands. This is the invitation and                        the admonition, in which the Church addresses the priest in the Rite of Ordination when                        the offerings of the holy people for the eucharistic sacrifice are placed in his hands.                        The “mystery” of which the priest is a “steward” (1 Cor. 4:1) is definitively Jesus                        Christ himself (PdV, 24).                        In a particular way, priests are the mystery and ministers of the divine agape by virtue                of the sacrament that marks, molds, and characterizes them ontologically into Christ (cf. PdV,                21), the supreme expression of the divine love that saves. Pastoral charity must mold the life                and works of the priest because it constitutes not only his precise task but also a logical and                responsible response to the gift received:                               The internal principle, the force which animates and guides the spiritual life of                        the priest inasmuch as he is configured to Christ the head and shepherd, is pastoral                        charity, as participation in Jesus Christ’s own pastoral charity, a gift freely bestowed                        by the Holy Spirit and likewise a task and a call which demand a free and committed                        response on the part of the priest (PdV, 23).                        Before entrusting the missionary mandate to the apostles (cf. Mt 28:19) and because of                the stupendous and tremendous handing over of the Eucharist and the priesthood in the Upper                Room, Jesus prays to the Father for the apostles: Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.                As you sent me into the world, so I sent them into the world. And for their sake, I consecrate                myself, that they also may be consecrated in truth (Jn 17:17-19). The \"truth\" is Christ himself,                the only savior of the world. So, the Father, through his consecratory action, regenerates the                apostles, creating in them a new image, that of Christ, his beloved Son (Col 1:13). With this                prayer, Jesus asks the Father to overflow with his divine love those whom he sends, so that,                perfect in unity, they may enter into Trinitarian Perichoresis: I in them and you in me, that they                may become perfectly one, so that the world may know that you sent me and have loved them                 even as you have loved me (Jn 17:23).                 37.2 The Rogate is the principle of eternal charity because the priesthood is the ministry                of Christ’s charity                       The  priesthood  is  not  only  a  mystery  but  also  a  ministry,  a  service  of  love.  The                missionary plan has its beginning in the divine agape. The Incarnate Word realizes it in the era                of the Church through the collaboration of those whom he calls, making them his disciples.                After  his  ascension  to  heaven,  Jesus  entrusts  to  the  apostles  the  missionary  mandate:  All                 authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore to make disciples of all                 nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching                them to observe all that I have commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, to the close of                the age (Mt 28:18-20).                        Go, for I have other sheep that are not of this fold (Jn 10:16).                       Having  received  the  mission  to  evangelize,  the  apostles  spread  out  throughout  the                world. This mission, especially through the ministry of priests, who have the duty to bring the                good news of salvation given to us in Jesus Christ, is still going on and will continue until the                end of the centuries. Benedict XVI affirms: The priest is part of that chosen group that Christ                                                               161","once gathered around himself. The Gospel of charity must reach the ends of the earth. The                Lord  of  the  harvest,  who  called  the  first  disciples,  continues  to  consecrate  and  send  the                collaborators of the beloved Son, to teach, preach, heal (cf. above, in 16), to bring to the world                the signs of his love, to make known a person who has the name and face of Jesus of Nazareth,                the supreme icon of God-Charity.                       John Paul II, in Redemptoris Missio 89, states:                                The missionary is urged on by “zeal for souls”, a zeal inspired by Christ’s own                        charity,  which  takes  the  form  of  concern,  tenderness,  compassion,  openness,                        availability, and interests in people’s problems. […] The missionary is a person of                        charity. In order to proclaim to all his brothers and sisters that they are loved by God                        and are capable of loving, he must show love toward all, giving his life for his neighbor.                       ... every man who is loved by God ... The love of brothers does not exclude anyone. The                preferential option for the poor (cf. VC, 82) is such because being in need, they are the first,                but not the only ones. Our Founder, although he is called the father of the orphans and the                poor,  extended  his  ardent  love  to  professionals  and  intellectuals  as  well.  On  a  sheet  that                accompanied the Letter to Friends, he writes:                                As a priest of Jesus Christ, from the time I embraced this holy ministry, I have                        always felt a lively affection, which made me desire the good and happiness of others                        as my own. […] I have seen my brother and my lord in everyone, and what I have                        desired for myself in this life and in the next, I desired them equally for everyone. […]                        And  now,  what  else  is  there  for  me  to  add?  […]  I  exhausted  all  the  loving  and                        insinuating persuasions to lead you into the saving arms of God, your Creator and                        Redeemer, to call your attention to the great importance of being saved eternally along                        with all your relatives […]. Yes, I have prayed; I will pray for your eternal salvation                        until the end of my life. […] But that is not enough. When I will be in heaven, in the                        bosom of my Creator and divine Redeemer, as I firmly hope, I will continue to pray face                        to face with my adorable Lord and the Blessed Virgin Mary, the saint after whom you                        are named and your Guardian Angel so that you may be saved eternally together with                        relatives, seeking your cooperation henceforth. And may I have the grace to have you                        as a companion in the eternal bliss! (AP, pp. 472-473).                        Benedict  XVI,  in  the  message,  on  the  occasion  of  the  World  Mission  Day  (2006),                writes:                                Charity, the soul of mission [...]. God's love for every person constitutes the                       heart of the experience and proclamation of the Gospel, and those who welcome it, in                       turn become its witnesses.                                […] It was after his resurrection that Jesus gave the Apostles the mandate to                       proclaim the news of his love. […] Ever since, the Church has continued this same                       mission, which an indispensable and ongoing commitment                        This is the reason why Father Hannibal affirms that the Rogate, that word of Jesus                Christ, is a command of supreme importance, indeed an infallible remedy for the salvation of                the Church and society (cf. Scritti, vol. 2, p .144). He goes on to emphasize that without the                Catholic priesthood it would be difficult to conceive works of faith and charity, mercy, and                compassion.                               In truth, what work of faith and charity can you think of on earth without the                        Catholic priesthood? (AR, p. 697).                                                                 162","Jesus  Christ  Our  Lord  addressed  those  words:  Rogate  ergo,  etc.…  suam                        especially to the Bishops, who were the chosen representatives of the Apostles, and to                        the priests who were the figures of the disciples, The need for this Prayer is still drawn                        from the great need that the Holy Church and all the peoples of the world have. It is a                        pre-established order of God that man cannot be led to truth and salvation except                        through the Priest. God established that the same Redemption becomes useless without                        the Priest to continue it and apply its fruits (News and Regulations for the Members of                                                                  40                        the Sacred Alliance, in Scritti, vol. 3, p. 39).                       Saint John Mary Vianney affirms: If there were no priests, the passion and death of                Jesus would not be worth anything. Therefore, the sending on the part of the Father, demands                the  Evangelical  Rogation.  The  Founder  has  no  doubt:  Vocations,  like  efficacious  grace,                descend from on high, and if we do not pray, if we do not carry out the command of Jesus                Christ, vocations will not descend (AP, p. 127). Without priests, Father Hannibal continues,                the resources for the expansion of the kingdom of God would dry up: There is no doubt that                the greatest resources that the Holy Church may have for the expansion of the kingdom of God                is contained in this divine command (“God and Neighbor”, June 1925, p. 13).                       In Pastores Dabo Vobis, using the words of Saint Augustine, John Paul II affirms that                each priest must configure himself to Christ as head and shepherd, and express pastoral charity                in his ministry:                               The ministry of the priest, precisely because of its participation in the saving                        ministry of Jesus Christ, the Head and Shepherd, cannot fail to express and live out his                        pastoral charity, which  is  both  source and spirit of  his  service and gift self. In its                        objective reality, the priestly ministry is “amoris officium”, according to the previously                        quoted expression of St. Augustine. This objective reality itself serves as both the basis                        and requirement for a corresponding ethos, which can be none other than a life of love,                        as St. Augustine himself points out: “Sit amoris officium pascere dominicum gregem.”                        This ethos, and as a result the spiritual life, is none other than embracing consciously                        and freely – that is to say in one’s mind and heart, in one’s decisions and actions – the                        \"truth\" of the priestly ministry as an “amoris officium” (PDV, 24).                       St. Paul, in his letter to the Romans, states:                                Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. But how are men to                        call upon him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of                         whom they have not heard? And how are they to hear without a preacher?  And how                        can men preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of                        those who preach [the] good news! (Rm 10:13-15).                       In  this  perspective,  the  Evangelical  Rogation  has  the  purpose  of  triggering  divine                breaking-in (=irruzione) the ways of men, of bringing the Deus-Caritas into collision with all                men, not for conflict, but, rather, for an embrace of love, precisely in this humanity, which is                dying for lack of love.                      The affirmation that God has established that Redemption is rendered useless without the Priest is identical to                40                that of Saint John Mary Vianney: If there were no priests, the passion and death of Jesus would not be worth                anything. Our Founder probably did not know Vianney's saying, otherwise, he would have quoted it in the speech                he gave at Forza D’Agrò on August 9, 1908, for the installation of the parish priest Antonino Catanese. In fact, in                this speech, he refers to the other statement of the Cure of Ars: If I saw a priest and an angel, I would greet the                priest first and then the angel. This phrase, quite significant when seen from the apologetic point of view, does                not  have  the objective force of  the  previous  ones  with  reference  to  the  mystery  and  ministry  of  redemption                entrusted by Christ to the priest. The two saints, without copying each other, affirm the same truth.                                                              163","It is worthwhile, to this effect, to read some passages from the Catechism of the Catholic                Church:                               no. 74: God \"desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth\"                        (1Tim 2:4), that is, of Christ Jesus (Jn 14:6). It is necessary, therefore, that Christ be                        proclaimed to all nations and individuals, so that this Revelation may reach the ends of                        the earth.                                no. 875: \"How are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And                        how are they to hear without a preacher? And how can men preach unless they are                        sent?\" No one - no individual and no community - can proclaim the Gospel to himself:                        \"Faith comes from what is heard.\" No one can give himself the mandate and the mission                        to proclaim the Gospel. The one sent by the Lord does not speak and act on his own                        authority, but by virtue of Christ's authority; not as a member of the community but                        speaking to it in the name of Christ. No one can bestow grace on himself; it must be                        given and offered. This fact presupposes ministers of grace, authorized, and empowered                        by Christ. From him, bishops and priests receive the mission and faculty (\"the sacred                        power\") to act in persona Christi Capitis; deacons receive the strength to serve the                        people of God in the diaconia of liturgy, word, and charity, in communion with the                        bishop and his presbyterate. The ministry in which Christ's emissaries do and give by                        God's grace what they cannot do and give by their own powers is called a \"sacrament\"                        by the Church's tradition. Indeed, the ministry of the Church is conferred by a special                        sacrament.                                                                                                                164","38. The Marian Dimension                                         of the Rogationist Spirituality                           In the spirituality of the Rogationists, Mary, Mother and Queen of the Rogate, occupies                a primary and important place.                         Witnesses affirm that Father Hannibal's devotion to the Virgin was very tender, ardent,                and constant. He honored Mary with faithful imitation, exalting her under all titles because she                is the Queen and Mother of the Evangelical Rogation. Concerning the Eucharistic spirituality,                for the Rogationists, Mary is the sublime and ineffable model. St. John Paul II, who spoke of                the relationship between the Eucharist and Mary with singular depth and originality, invites us                to learn from the school of the Mother of Jesus:                                If the Church and the Eucharist are inseparably united, the same ought to                       be said of Mary and the Eucharist. This is one reason why since ancient times, the                       commemoration of Mary has always been part of the Eucharistic celebrations of                       the Churches of the East and West (EdE 57).                         In the Founder's intuition, Mary is associated with Jesus Christ in the handing over of                                                                 st                the gift of the Rogate. In a sermon written on July 1 , he addressed the Virgin with these words:                               You who kept in your maternal heart the words of your Divine Son, you                       certainly did not fail to keep this sublime utterance, born from the zeal of the Most                       Holy  Heart  of  Jesus:  \"Rogate  ergo  Dominum  messis,  ut  mittat  operarios  in                       messem suam.\" O, admirable mystery of your maternal goodness!                               This sacred word, this divine command, hidden \"in Corde tuo\" [in your                       heart], you deigned it to reveal to us, your little children in the midst of these                       hovels, and through us, you also deigned to spread it elsewhere and to draw the                       attention of the Holy Church to it (Mary Most Holy, life, sweetness, our hope, in                       Scritti, vol. 54, n. 4228).                         Article 10 of the Regulations of the Divine Superiors reads:                               Here is a rule that I give you, together with my Blessed Mother, as sweet,                       kind, and loving superiors: do not get tired of begging the Lord of the harvest [...].                        The Founder gave his followers a badge with the features that make up the Virgin's                aspects, so that they may reproduce them in their lives, through true devotion and imitation.                Next to Jesus and in Jesus, I will love with the same love his Blessed Mother, whose devotion,                I perceive to my great consolation, forms the special badge this Pious Institute (Declarations                and Promises, III).                         It is interesting to note a truly original affirmation of Father Hannibal, who sees in                Mary, the Mother of the Church, the one praying (= orante) for priestly vocations, precisely as                a Eucharistic woman:                                We know that the Blessed Virgin kept in her heart the words of her divine                       Son (Lk 2:51). And why did she keep them? Perhaps to render them idle, like the                       talent of the Gospel? (Mt 25, 25). Not at all. Instead, to practice tirelessly what                       her divine Son commanded. That is why she never idly ate the Eucharistic Bread,                                                                 165","but with her prayers, she procured and still procures ministers of the altar (AR,                       p. 696).                          Apart  from  the  fact  that  her  prayers,  together  with  her  humility  and  virginity,  she                obtained from the heavenly Father, the Redeemer, the Priest of Priests (Eucharistic title of July                  st                1  of 1935), she continued to pray and to make a school of prayer for the apostles in the Upper                Room to obtain good laborers. Besides, she still intercedes with the Lord of the harvest in                heaven to send holy priests on earth.                        As Mother of the High Priest, Mary is the mother of all to whom Jesus shares his                priesthood; of those through whose hands, when celebrating the Eucharist, make the Word of                God sacramentally become flesh, just as it became flesh in her immaculate womb.                         Mary, Mother of priests, participates in the priesthood of Chris not in the line of the                common priesthood of the baptized, or of the ministerial one, but in the line of motherhood. It                is so because she is the mother of Jesus Christ, who has been a priest from the moment of the                incarnation. At that moment, human nature, assumed by the person of the Word, received the                anointing of the Holy Spirit, to perform the priestly functions of mediator between God and                man.                        Finally, the Rogationist, following the words Mary addressed to the servants of the                wedding  at  Cana:  Do  whatever  he  tells  you  (Jn  2:5),  must  feel  that  tender  exhortation  to                accomplish the Word that defines him as a Rogationist.                                                                                                             166","39. The Most Holy Name of Jesus, St. Joseph,                                               St. Anthony of Padua                           A further constitutive element of the spirituality of the Rogationists is the veneration                and devotion to the Most Holy Name of Jesus. To obtain good laborers from the Lord of the                harvest, Father Hannibal has chosen to follow the path indicated by Jesus himself: Whatever                you ask the Father in my name, he may give you (Jn 15:16).                               Let the Daughters of Divine Zeal understand well that this great devotion                       to the most adorable and Holy Name of Jesus must be kept alive and fervent in                       our Institutes, with the consecration of the whole month [of January], a solemn                       novena, the Feast of January 31, and the presentation of the supplication (= the                       Great Supplica) containing 34 petitions or requests (Regulation for the Daughters                       of Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus, December 15, 1920).                        The devotion to Saint Joseph, the guide and teacher of the interior life, forms part of                                                                                                       st                the Rogationist spirituality.

Also, Father Hannibal proclaimed the glorious miracle worker Saint Anthony of Padua                an outstanding benefactor of these Institutes and all of us and an excellent model of a good                                                     st                laborer.

The Path of Faithfulness                   40.1 Jesus, Model of Faithfulness                         Our faithfulness must find reason and strength in the faithfulness of Jesus Christ, the                faithful and true witness (Rev 3:14). Saint Paul affirms this clearly:                                 That is why we utter the Amen through him, to God for glory.  It is God                       who establishes us with you in Christ and has commissioned us; he has put his                       seal upon us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee (2 Cor. 1:20-22).                         With the word “seal”, Saint Paul intends to highlight our participation in the faithfulness                of Jesus Christ, in the Spirit. The whole life of Christ is constantly anchored to the will of the                Father, even when the latter presents him the bitter chalice of passion. Jesus demonstrates his                faithfulness to the Father:                        1.  when he remains in the Temple, while Mary and Joseph, distressed, looked for him                           (cf. Lk 2:49).                         2.  when he strongly rebuked Peter, who wanted to draw him away from the Father's                           will (cf. Mk 8:33).                         3.  in dramatic circumstances, when he declares his intention to do the Father's will,                           even if everyone should abandon him: Do you also wish to go away? (Jn 6:67).                        4.  at the supreme moment of his life, when he raises the song of faithfulness to the                           Father:  It  is  accomplished  (Jn  19:30).  Christ  is  the  Father's  “yes”:  all  the  Old                           Testament promises found faithful fulfillment in him.                        After Christ, Mary is the model of our faithfulness. The Council exalts the faith of                Mary: She faithfully persevered in her union with her Son unto the cross (LG 58). She offered                her  consent  loyally  during  the  Annunciation  and  which  she  sustained  without  wavering                [beneath the cross] (cf. LG 62).                  40.2 Faithfulness to God's commandments                         The discourse concerning the faithfulness of those who make the religious profession,                whether temporary or perpetual, encompasses all dimensions of Christian perfection. In the                first place, the religious must be faithful to the promises of baptism and the commands of God.                         When the one called is presented before the altar of Christ to be consecrated to the                Rogate, he must already possess the basic perfection of the rich young man of the Gospel:                Teacher, all these I have observed from my youth.  [...]. And Jesus looking upon him loved him                (Mk 10: 20-21).                        It would be absurd to claim to be a “religious” without having a proven experience of                faithfulness to his “being a Christian”.  It is impossible to be faithful in the observance of the                evangelical counsels if one has not had a valid experience of faithfulness in the observance of                God’s commands.                         If someone wanted to run the risk of building his existence as a consecrated without                this essential and robust foundation, he would inevitably end up with devastating consequences                at the spiritual, psychological, and social levels.                                                               168","40.3 Faithfulness during the temporary profession                        The novice who makes the first vows, even for a year, immediately sets himself on the                horizon of a life that is totally committed to God, that is, he is available to become a perfect                holocaust.                        The period of temporary vows is oriented towards the perpetual profession, and the                duration of temporary profession ought to be like a learning moment and a preparation for the                definitive commitment that includes the firm will of absolute faithfulness (cf. La Formazione                Rogazionista, p. 427).                         In his heart, the novice already gives himself to God in a complete, unconditional, and                definitive way, but this gift will complete his person with a perpetual profession.                         With the temporary profession, the Rogationist is a religious in all aspects. He publicly                commits himself to God and his Institute to live the evangelical life of the Christ of the Rogate                according to the mind/intelligence, experience, and teaching of the Founder. He embraces all                the requirements prescribed in the rules of life and mission, in preparation for the final bond.                         The  temporary  vow  has  the  same  seriousness  of  content,  the  same  gravity  of                commitment, and the same obligation of conscience as the perpetual vow.                  40.4 Faithfulness after perpetual profession                         Given that: 1) the consecration of a person in the state of religious life is the exclusive                initiative of God; it is a free and gratuitous act reserved to God; 2) God does not repeat the                same action twice, because every act of his is unique, definitive, unrepeatable, and irrevocable.                        From this, it follows that the Rogationist who accepts the call of God consciously and                freely, and lets himself to be consecrated with the perpetual profession, gives himself totally to                the Lord, with an equally unique, definitive, unrepeatable, and irrevocable act. The mystery                that is realized in the perpetual profession starts from the free initiative of God, and the one                who consecrates himself freely gives his answer that includes totality and irrevocability: I make                my perpetual vow.                         He who goes to the altar of the Lord to pronounce the perpetual profession ought to                have the same feelings that Benedict XVI had during the conclave, which elected him pontiff.                On that occasion, he confided to his friends: The progress of the voting made us understand                that the guillotine was slowly approaching, and it was directed to me. The guillotine makes a                sharp blow. Nobody ever used the guillotine as a metaphor to indicate the action of the Spirit.                The guillotine of the Spirit separated Joseph Ratzinger's life from that of Benedict XVI with a                sharp blow. This image also fits well in demonstrating the irrevocable experience that we live                when we surrender ourselves to the Lord with all our being, in response to his all-encompassing                call.                         The  faithfulness  of  the  religious  with  perpetual  vows  is  analogous  to  and  exceeds                spousal fidelity.                        In the “here I am” of the perpetual profession and the following consecratory prayer, a                                        41                nuptial rite is performed.  In the act of consecration, the Spirit shares the grace of the Rogate                to the one consecrated, like the outpouring during the Pentecost. This, in turn, produces a new                  41  In the liturgy of the consecration of virgins, the giving of the ring expresses a spousal symbol.                                                              169","and indelible participation in the life and mission, which the Christ of the Rogate proclaims in                the synagogue of Nazareth: The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, etc. (Lk 4:18).                        According to John Paul II, by allowing themselves to be guided by the Spirit on an                endless  journey  of  purification,  they  become,  day  after  day,  conformed  to  Christ,  the                prolongation in history of a special presence of the Risen Lord (VC, 19). For the Rogationists,                the Risen Lord is the Christ of the Rogate.                         It is a spousal choice that goes beyond the mere legal bond and is essentially configured                as a pact of love. Jesus saying of himself, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and                abide in his love, he says to his disciples, If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my                love (Jn 15:10).                        The command that the Rogationist received from the Spirit is the Rogate, and from the                moment he pronounces his “yes”, he is no longer “celibate”, but a married person, indissolubly                and totally united to the Christ of the Rogate, chosen by love.                        In the document attesting to the profession of vows - whether temporary or perpetual -                signed by the Rogationist at the altar (symbol of Christ), Christ also affixes his signature. A                signature,  belonging  to  Christ,  that  no  one  will  ever  erase.  Equally  indelible  must  be  the                signature of the Rogationist.                  40.5 Fight to win                        Like that of Christ, our faithfulness is also continually threatened by the devil. The fight                against the tempter is constant in the life of consecrated persons and requires vigilance, prayer,                union with God, and continuous recourse to the Spirit (cf. Mt 6, 13; 1Pd 5, 8).                         However, we must not be discouraged. Faithfulness is not only stirred up by God, but                it is also sustained and nurtured by him:                               God is faithful and will not let you be tempted beyond your strength; but                       with the temptation will also provide a way of escape, that you may be able to                       endure it. (1 Cor 10:13).                               But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from evil. (2                       Thes 3:3).                        It would be an excellent and holy habit for the Rogationist, whose vocation is generated                from the Eucharist, that in the celebration or participation in the Holy Mass, when he receives                the Body and Blood of the Lord and pronounces the liturgical amen, he would renew and revive                the yes of his profession of the vows. He then asks the Lord for the strength to be a faithful and                truthful witness  of the sublime vocation he received and to  present  himself as such to  his                brothers. However, we must remember that faithfulness is not built on soft pillows but on living                stone, and that is why it requires perseverance, vigilance, and sacrifices, so as not to waste a                precious existence in the Church.                         To remain faithful to one’s vocation, and follow Jesus Christ till the end, it is necessary                to accept the challenges and fight with the certainty of victory, Difficulties must not lead to                discouragement because God is with us.                                The call to holiness is accepted and can be cultivated only in the silence                       of  adoration before  the  infinite  transcendence  of  God  […].  In  practice,  this                       involves great fidelity to liturgical and personal prayer, to periods  devoted to                       mental prayer and contemplation, to Eucharistic adoration, to monthly retreats,                                                                170","and  spiritual  exercises.  There  is  also  a  need  to  rediscover  the ascetic                       practices typical of the spiritual tradition of the Church and of the individual’s                       own Institute. These have been and continue to be a powerful aid to authentic                       progress  in  holiness.  Asceticism  helps  master  and  correct  the  inclinations  of                       human nature wounded by sin, is truly indispensable if consecrated persons are                       to remain faithful to their vocation and follow Jesus on the way of the Cross. It is                       also necessary to recognize and overcome certain temptations, which, sometimes,                       by diabolical deceit, present themselves under the appearance of good. […]                                The path to holiness, thus involves the acceptance of spiritual combat. This                       is a demanding reality that is not always given due attention today. Tradition has                       often seen an image of this spiritual combat in Jacob's wrestling with the mystery                       of God, whom he confronts to receive his blessing and to see him (cf. Gen 32:23-                       31). In this episode from the beginnings of biblical history, consecrated persons                       can recognize a symbol of the asceticism which they need to open their hearts to                       the Lord and to their brothers and sisters (VC, 38).                                                                                                                          171","APPENDIX I                                    The Consecrating Action of God in the Religious Profession                          Since some scholars of religious life hold that consecration begins with the temporary                profession, while others – and they are the majority – are of the opinion that it happens only in                the perpetual profession, I consider it is useful, for the purpose of giving an answer, to examine                the rite of the two professions.                        First of all: 1) to consecrate a person in the religious state is God’s exclusive action.                The current expression I consecrate myself does not mean I make myself  sacred, but it means                that I dedicate myself (from the Latin devovere), I keep myself apart, I destine myself, I offer                myself, I give myself, I put myself in the hands of God (from Latin mancipare), I consider                                               42                myself  taken  (=expropriated).   In  the  religious  profession,  we  must  not  confuse  the                consecrating action by God, who acts through the Church, with the action of the person who                gives himself totally and unconditionally to God. 2) God does not repeat the same act twice,                because it is unique, definitive, unrepeatable, and irrevocable.                         If these premises are true, the thesis of those who affirm that consecration occurs in the                rite of the temporary profession is not sustainable. If this were so - since the act of God is                unique, definitive, unrepeatable, irrevocable - there would be no need to repeat the consecration                three, four, or six times.                        Nor  can  we  admit  that  in  temporary  profession  there  would  be  the  beginning  of  a                consecration that will have its fulfillment in the perpetual profession. God does not consecrate                several times: with consecration, he imposes a total seal on the being and the action of the                person.                        Let us examine the rite of temporary profession. There is no mention of consecration                in this rite. In fact, to the interrogation of the celebrant, the candidate answers: I humbly ask                you to be able to consecrate myself to God. He does not say by God but to God; thus, the                action is posed by the one who is speaking, not by God. In the prayer, the priest says: today                he wants to consecrate his life to You, and not he wants to be consecrated by You. Finally, in                the handing of the religious habit, the priest addresses the candidate and says by this sign of                your consecration, that is, “sign that you consecrated yourself to God”: the subject is the                candidate.                         Let us now briefly examine the rite of perpetual profession. Let us begin by highlighting                its solemnity, analogous to that of the ordination of priests. Solemnity is required by the nature                of the rite. In the litanies, which are an integral part of the rite, the priest asks God to bless,                sanctify, and consecrate the candidates. The same invocations are addressed to the Lord in the                ordination  of  the  priests.  The  term  “consecration”  as  God’s  action  is  explicitly  and                incontestably found in solemn blessing or consecration. In the first formula, the celebrant says                pour out the Holy Spirit upon them. In the second formula, we have the invocation of the Spirit                - the consecratory epiclesis - We beg you, O Father, to pour out the Paraclete Spirit from                heaven on these children of yours.                         The enormous difference between the rite of the temporary profession and the rite of                the perpetual profession is evident. The Magisterium of the Church also affirms that only in                the  perpetual  profession  there  is  consecration  on  the  part  of  God.  To  the  question:  Does                    42  Cf. the Latin edition of the Lumen Gentium, 44a, 44b; Perfectae Caritatis 5, 6c.                                                              172","consecration happen with the temporary or perpetual profession? The Congregation for Divine                Worship answers: A person is consecrated by perpetual profession and by the concomitant                liturgical action of the Church. The very nature of consecration requires it, which presupposes                totality and perpetuity (“Notitiæ”, March 1971, p. 109). This answer was given after the Second                Vatican Council and after the promulgation of the rite of religious profession authorized by                Paul VI and promulgated by the Congregation for Divine Worship on February 2, 1970. It does                not appear to me that there were statements to the contrary.                                                                                                                                         173","Appendix II                                 PRIESTLY UNION OF PRAYER FOR VOCATIONS                                                         By-Laws                                                                  *                     I.  NATURE and PURPOSE                                                                   43                    1.  The Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations  is a specific form of membership to the                        Union of Prayer for Vocations (UPV) for those ordained  Ministers who wish to live                        the gift of prayer for vocations in a more intense communion among themselves and                        with the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                     2.  The inspiration and foundation of the Union is the command of Jesus, “The harvest is                        great, but the laborers are few. Pray [Rogate] therefore the Lord of the harvest to send                        out laborers into his harvest” (Mt 9, 37-38, Lk 10,2), lived according to the spirit and                        example of St. Hannibal Mary Di Francia, the Founder the Rogationists and the Daugh-                        ters of Divine Zeal.                    3.  The Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations proposes to its members:                           a.  To adopt the mission of the UPV, that is:                                -  to pray for the laborers of the harvest;                               -  to spread the prayer for the laborers of the harvest in the Church and in the                                  world so that it would become universal;                                -  to be good laborers themselves in the harvest of the Lord according to one’s                                  state of life.                            b.  To realize with the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal an effective                               spirituality of communion, through sharing the charism of the Rogate and the                               mutual prayer for the fulfillment of their respective missions.                            c.  To rekindle one’s priestly vocation through the spirit of prayer for laborers for                               the harvest, taking as a model of life St. Hannibal Mary Di Francia, who was a                               witness and apostle of this prayer.                     4.  Bishops and priests, both diocesan and religious, of whatever Catholic rite and hier-                        archical rank, may be part of the Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations.                    5.  Membership to the PUPV shall not entail any financial burden and shall be done by                        sending a letter to the Office of the Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations.                    6.  It is good to renew one’s membership annually, on special occasions, such as the                        World Day of Prayer for Vocations.                   *  EN: In Appendix II of the original Italian, the Author reports the By-Laws of the Priestly Union of Prayer for                Vocations (PUPV) that was in vigor at the time of the publication of the book.

Live their ministry in the dimension of the culture of vocations and to promote                               the primacy of prayer in the pastoral care of vocations to the priestly ministry                               and the consecrated life.                      IV. SPIRITUAL AND PASTORAL BENEFITS                    9.  Every month a Holy Mass “pro vivis” and “pro defunctis” for the members of the                        Priestly Union of Prayer for Vocations is celebrated at the respective General Houses                        of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                    10.

OFFICE                    13. In as much as the procedure of membership is through the UPV, the offices of the PUPV                        are those indicated in the By-Laws of the UPV (nos. 15-16)                                                                          175","Appendix III                                        UNION OF PRAYER FOR VOCATIONS                                                                   *                                                        BY-LAWS                 I. NATURE and MISSION                                                              44                1. The Union of Prayer for Vocations (UPV)  is an ecclesial aggregation inspired by Jesus’                command, “Pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest” (Mt 9,37-38; Lk                10,2), according to the charism of St. Hannibal Mary Di Francia, commonly referred to as the                charism of the “Rogate” and transmitted to the Congregations he founded: the Rogationists of                the Heart of Jesus and the Daughters of Divine Zeal. The UPV is of spiritual nature and makes                use  of  the  suitable  organizational  structure  for  the  diffusion  of  prayer  for  laborers  of  the                harvest.                 “The purpose of this Pious Union is to propagate everywhere this prayer so relevant in our                times;  so  that  Rogation  would  become  universal,  which  merits  to  obtain  from  the  divine                goodness so great a mercy” (Father Hannibal M. Di Francia, Rules of the Pious Union, art. 3).                 2. The mission of the UPV shall be:                    -      To pray for the laborers of the harvest;                     -      To spread the prayer for the laborers of the harvest in the Church and in the world                           so that it would become universal;                     -      To be good laborers in the harvest of the Lord according to one’s state of life.                3. The UPV is addressed to all Catholic faithful of any vocation: lay, consecrated, and ordained                ministers. In the universal spirit of the “charism of the Rogate”, it is likewise addressed to all                those who are interested in building a civilization of love, whatever may be their profession of                faith.                4. The nature of the UPV commits its members to promote a culture of vocations in the context                where they live and work.                5. By its nature, membership to the UPV fosters and entails a path of gradual vocational growth                through participation in the ecclesial charism of the Rogate, which is a way to holiness.                  II. FORMS OF MEMBERSHIP                6. Membership to the UPV takes different forms and in different ways. Members will be able                to choose the one best suited for their spiritual sensitivity and conditions of life.                 It is good to renew one’s membership annually, on special occasions, such as the World Day                of Prayer for Vocations.                  7.

Letterio D’Arrigo.                                                              176","By filling in the appropriate membership form, each member strives to live the goals expressed                in article 2, according to his sensitivity and personal availability.                This first form is basic to all members of the UPV.                  8. Community or group membership                     a)  Cenacles of prayer                       The “cenacle of prayer” is a group of members of the UPV and is animated by the                       person in charge. It aims to:                    -      be a school of prayer for the laborers of the harvest and center of promoting a jouney                           of holiness;                     -      offer specific and organized catechesis for the formation of the members;                    -      deepen the Rogationist spirituality through the celebration of Proper liturgies.                    b) Rogationist associations                        Membership to any of the Rogationist Associations, by its nature, implies membership                       to the UPV.                    c)  Non-Rogationist associations or groups                        Members of non-Rogationist associations and groups may join the UPV, as individuals                       or as groups, filling in the appropriate membership form and committing themselves to                       live the goals indicated in article 2.                  III.  ORGANIZATION                9. The UPV is an ecclesial aggregation mainly of spiritual character, with an organization at                the central and circumscription level. The General Governments of the Congregations of the                Rogationists  and  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  are  responsible  for  the  supervision  and                ratification of the general guidelines and policies.                10. The governments of the Circumscriptions of Rogationists and of the Daughters of Divine                Zeal promote and support the UPV within their territory through the Rogate Vocation Center                of the Circumscription. They will also draw up the implementing regulation of the UPV for the                Circumscription in which they will specify the roles and responsibilities at different levels and                determine the forms of institutional membership of the growing cenacles of prayer (See 8a).                 11.  The  Rogate  Vocation  Center  of  the  Circumscription,  in  collaboration  with  local                Communities, shall provide the animation and formation of members of the UPV through                specific initiatives and the production of appropriate aids.                 12. The pastoral care of the UPV members, in the different forms specified by the By-Laws of                the Circumscription, is entrusted to local Communities.                  IV. SPIRITUAL BENEFITS                 13. Each month a Mass “pro vivis” and “pro defunctis” for UPV members is celebrated in the                respective General Houses of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                14. The communities of the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal will pray with a                specific intention for the sanctification of the UPV members.                                                              177","V.
