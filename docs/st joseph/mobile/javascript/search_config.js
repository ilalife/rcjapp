The  first  grace,  from  which  his  immeasurable     goodness derives, is that of being chosen to the     virgin  Bridegroom  of the Immaculate Virgin     Mary. For this, he could say: “Venerunt mihi omnia     bona pariter cum illa” [All good things came to     me together with her  (Wisdom 7:11)].  From     being Mary’s Bridegroom, all  goodness  came     to him. Joseph was born with very special gifts.     According to his name which means \"Continual                                           7","Growth\": “Filius accrescens Joseph - Joseph is      growing son» [Gen. 49:22], he grew day by day,      hour by hour, in every virtue, because he had to      be worthy to marry the Immaculate Lady Mary      who is the Queen of all Saints.       He  is the Patron of  the universal Church.      \"Patron\" means protector. He  who protects      loves. If he protects and does  not love, that      means that his  protection  is  momentary. The      protection of Saint Joseph is all full, or better,      overflowing  with  love  for  all  the  members  of      the Holy Church, in fact for all mankind, because      even the infidels are the object of the maternal      care of the Holy Church and all the righteous      belong to the soul of the Church, wherever they      may be, for to them God will give faith and love,      even at the point of death, and will save them.      All,  according to the greater or lesser      disposition and devotion, feel more or less the      great protection of  Saint  Joseph.  It  is  felt  by      the workers who find in Him the model of the      just and honest worker; it is felt by the families      who,  being  the  head  of  the  Holy  Family,  find      in him the true protector; it is felt by the poor      because Saint Joseph  was poor  too,  and now      he is the father of providence; it is felt by the       8","rich because Saint Joseph was the descendant      of  King  David;  the  virgins  feel  his  protection      because he  was the guardian of  the virginity      of  Mary;  it  is  felt  by  the  children  whom  he      especially loves, having embraced and loved      them all while he embraced the Child Jesus.

Here is the Lamp of Vocations         that burns before you, that asks you           incessantly to send holy workers            to the Church, and with that,          we also implore you for vocations                for our community.       10","O heavenly steward of the Holy Church,          provide us according to your mercy         and our needs. What we ask of you,      the gift of vocations, is the sum of all graces.       Graciously hear our ardent supplications.           If those words of Holy Scripture,             “Ite ad Ioseph”, refer to you,          why would we not hurry at your feet          in hunger and thirst for justice that      troubles us, in the famine that so afflicts us,            of the workers of the harvest?      Strengthen the hope which we have placed          in you, and grant our supplication.           What grace would Jesus and Mary      deny you in heaven? Are not all the treasures          of divine mercy entrusted to you?       For that adorable Child that you carried in                your arms, hear us;          for your Immaculate Bride, hear us;           for these divine Hearts that thirst            and hunger for souls, hear us;               for the zeal and charity            of the adorable Heart of Jesus       that drew out from him those divine words:      So ask the Master of the Harvest, to send out           laborers for his harvest, hear us.        We expect from you this singular grace;          let our hope not be in vain.

Giuseppe Marrazzo,  RCJ was     born in San Vito dei Normanni (Brindisi, Italy)     on May 5, 1917. At the age of 13, he entered     the Rogationist  seminary in  Trani (Ba) and     was ordained  a priest on May 9, 1943. He     spent almost all his life exercising the ministry     of reconciliation in the Shrine of Saint Anthony     in Messina, Italy.              His ideal is summed up in loving and     becoming  a saint,  following  the spirit of the     Founder, Saint Hannibal Mary Di Francia, and     dedicating himself to hearing confessions so     that Messina  may become  a second  Padua     and the sanctuary of Saint Anthony, in which     he  administered  the mercy of God  for more     than 40 years, may become a fragrant garden     of virtues and saints, sanctifying the souls that     the Lord entrusted him.              Most devoted to Our Lady, whom he     invoked as Mother of Good Counsel, he paid     special attention to the sick. He died suddenly     in Messina  on November  30, 1992.  As     confirmation of the holiness which he enjoyed     when he was alive, the announcement of his                                            37","death immediately  spread the  news that  «a     saint has died!». His  memory  is alive  in the     midst of the people and the fame of holiness     is growing.  The Diocesan  Process for     beatification is underway.       From the writings of Father Marrazzo:      JOSEPH, A MAN OF FAITH     The  figure  of  Saint  Joseph  is  of  primary     importance for his great faith. Without faith, it     is impossible to please God. We admire the     faith of  Abraham who believes  in God who     promises him a descendant as numerous as     the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea.     Abraham also believes when God says to him:     “Take your son and sacrifice him.”      Saint Joseph is a man of faith. Mary manifested     her faith by saying, “Behold the handmaid of     the Lord.” Joseph manifests his faith without     speaking but obeying God. With his actions,     he  says  “Ecce  servus  tuus”  [Behold  your     servant]. At the foundation of faith is love. God     did not make us  to  understand  but  to  love.     Whoever loves understands.        38","Mary, the faithful virgin, needed a husband      worthy of her, for this God chose Joseph      who in addition  to believing  in the angel      also believed in Mary and her divine      motherhood.  Joseph  and  Mary believe  in      the divinity of Jesus.       Saint Joseph and the interior virtue: I am      called  to holiness,  to union  with God, to      complete detachment from the world; I lack      the inner virtue that I will ask Saint Joseph      daily.      PATRON OF A HAPPY DEATH      Saint Joseph is the patron of a happy death      because he died beside Jesus and Mary.      We say: “Jesus, Joseph, and Mary, I give      you my  heart and soul. Jesus,  Joseph,      and Mary, assist me in the last agony. May      Jesus, Joseph, and Mary,  may  I  breathe      forth my soul in peace with you.”       We love Jesus and Mary as did Saint      Joseph. May the love for Jesus and Mary,      which filled the heart of Saint Joseph, may      also fill our hearts. Let us take courage and      be always with Jesus, the only purpose of      our lives.                                            39","Whoever receives graces through the          intercession of the Servant of God          Fr. Giuseppe Marrazzo is asked to                communicate it to:               The Postulator General         of the Rogationists at Via Tuscolana                167 - 00182 ROMA                 Tel. 06 7020751 -            Email: postulazione@rcj.org                   40","Devotion and Teachings      of St. Hannibal Mary Di Francia                         on              ST. JOSEPH                                            41","uring  the  first  World  War,  the  Father  added          three    “Glory Be”  to  the  prayers  before  and     Dafter the meals, respectfully to St. Joseph, St.      Michael, and St Anthony of Padua. I once invoked      first St. Michael, Second St. Joseph. He told me, “The      question whether St. Joseph is greater or not than St.      Michael is useless. I place St. Joseph soon after the most      Holy Virgin. Since Jesus, Mary and Joseph were always      united on earth, they must be together in heaven. The      glorious St. Michael should take no offense.”             “St. Joseph followed Jesus and Mary      immediately, because he is the Father of the      providence, the Patron  of the  Church, the model  of      interior life, the patron of the institute. As he nourished      and defended the child Jesus, so he had to protect the      least institution of the Evangelical Rogation along      with the orphanages.”             The Di Francia family was very devout      to St. Joseph and had a pretty wooden bust of the      saint, before which the whole family renewed its      consecration to the saint, every year. We have many      formulas written and signed by the family members,      beginning with 1876. When the Father's mother      died, the bust was transferred to Avignone.             To improve  his interior  life, the Father      entrusted himself to St. Joseph.      42","“O glorious St. Joseph, I appeal to you, the distributor      of divine treasures. I wish to become a saint belong      totally to Jesus, to serve him in this institute as he      wants” (Vol. 4, page 18). He addresses him, imploring      that devil and nature cheat him no way while treating      his affairs. “O glorious Patriarch, concern yourself with      it so that the affair may be according to the divine      will, for the greater consolation of the most holy Heart      of Jesus ... O powerful saint, see to it that my trust in      you and my appeal to your powerful protection have      good results! I am expecting from you the divine graces      which do not gratify my selfishness and passions, but      please the most holy Heart of Jesus and the wishes of      his soul” (Vol. 6, page 12).             Since the beginning, the Father puts      his institution under the protection of St. Joseph,      invoking him with an ardent prayer.      O sublime, powerful, compassionate saint, all of us are      kneeling at your feet... Deign to look mercifully and      benignly at these places of extreme misery, affliction,      and disorder. This is the kingdom of ignorance, nausea,      dreariness, abandon, and sin, where the hellish enemy      torments the bodies and ruins the souls. We implore      you with raised hands. Come, see, and protect these      places, putting this quarter along with its dwellers      under your powerful protection. Shelter the dwellers      and their slums under your mantle; enlighten so      many darkened minds with your grace and wisdom...      have mercy on the unsafe little virgins, the feeble,      abandoned poor, and the dispersed children who are      growing in stench and abandon. Deign to protect the      works of charity started in this place, helping them                                           43","grow as buds of the most holy Heart of Jesus. Make new      works of charity rise in order to shelter the abandoned      children and to keep the souls away from ignorance      and sin (Vol. 8, page 12).             He called the little house of the first four      sisters, Little Retreat of Saint Joseph, and entrusted      the seed of the nascent congregation of the saint.      “I entrust these four souls to your fatherly charity;      deign  to  sanctify  and  make  them  apt  to  fulfill  the      divine plan... O glorious saint, I beseech you to make      their  will  sincere,  their  purpose  firm,  their  intention      wise, their wish fervent, their behavior holy, and their      devotion perseverant.” Then, he concludes, “If some      of these persons are not called to the religious state,      you see to it that only those whom God deigned to call      to the religious profession dwell in this Little Retreat,      consecrated to you” (Vol. 4, page 23).             The sisters took the garb and the vows      on March 19. When the male community began      taking the garb and the vows, they also were under      the  protection of the  saint. But  to have the Father      available (he was busy with the sisters on March 19),      their liturgy was set on the saint's patronage feast,      which was celebrated on the third Wednesday or      Sunday after Easter.             The feast of the saint was preceded by a      devotion on seven Wednesday and a solemn novena.      Before renewing their vows, the Rogationist said      the novena of the saint's patronage, prayers to the      most holy Heart of Jesus, to the most holy Virgin      Immaculate, and to the saint. Then the community     44","listened to the preaching, or meditated on the      religious state. Usually, the Father  commented      enthusiastically some passage from Paradise      on earth, by Father Natale, S.J., making practical      applications. Today the book is out fashion, but it      confirmed many vocations in the old days.             To implore the saint's help for the      institute and its member, the Father wrote seven      strophes, which the orphans sang, once a day, while      working. We quote one of them:                   Buy this place                And grant us the virtue.                Drive away the devil,              Keeping us sound and safe.                O saint, please implant                  This little plant.              As to the interior life of the community,      the Father counted on the saint, to whom he wrote      a prayer (Vol. 4, page 8). The community said it      every day in March. He also appealed to the saint for      holy vocations, lighted the vocation lamp before his      statue, and often mentioned it in the hymns to Saint      Joseph, beginning with July first 1905. (4)               O saint, see the little flame             Before you by night and by day,            Burning and praying in its frame          The elect and the saint to display (1905).              If the lamp burning around              Begs the elect for our ground,                                           45","Co-founder, hear our case,             And grant us your grace! (1906)                  The burning light                Shining day and night,                 Isn't the aerial bell               Calling others to its dwell?                     ..............              From cities, unknown villages             Call the children God privileges,               Innocent, pure, and sincere          As should be those of our sphere... (1914)      In the institute's early days, before St. Anthony's bread     devotion was born, the ecclesial purveyor was St.     Joseph, to whom the father appealed in his needs. We     recall an episode of those times. The baker had sued     the father for arrears. When the judge asked the father     who was his lawyer, he pulled a picture of St. Joseph     out of his pocket, and said, “This is my lawyer. What     can I do? I have, and I will pay when St. Joseph gives     me the means. I beg my creditor to take things to with     a good deal of patience...” At these words, the creditor,     whose name was Present, came out saying, “Once     again you say \"I have, and I will pay; be patient.\" And     once again I will be patient....” The hearing was closed.             In  1911, an  apostolic  visitor  came  to     our institute. Inaugurating a statue of St. Joseph at     Taormina, the Father proclaimed the saint \"Visitor\":        46","We exult with great joy,          Sisters and Daughters of the Sacred Heart;            We hear the echo of a pious decoy:         Joseph the Visitor has come to our hearth...              The petitions he addressed to St. Joseph     in any circumstance were continuous. Let us read a     report, “The saint's bust in the chapel seemed to be     a post-man, full as it was with envelopes and keys.     Every time the father bought the Avignone slums, he     entrusted the saint with the house keys, as a sign if     the saint's ownership.” Unfortunately, in 1919, the     church caught fire and the statue was lost along with     the petitions. They were a good piece of the institute's     story!             The father sums up St. Joseph's work in the     institute:              The holy Patriarch held it since its beginning     as  though  it  was  entrusted  to  him  by  the  most  holy     Heart of Jesus and by his divine spouse Mary. The little     plant  was  entrusted to  St.  Joseph,  who  protected  it     lovingly amidst the clouds and the storms. When the     soil around was dry, he laid on it the morning dew.     When the sun was about to wither it, he covered the     plant with his mantle. When a passenger was trampling     on, or rooting it out, he defended it.             When animals threatened with  devouring     it, he drove them away into abyss. When the torrents     rushed headlong down the plant, he built up     embankments. He made it grow according to Jesus' and     Mary's wish by strengthening its roots, stretching out     its branches, and bringing its fruits to maturity. Finally,                                          47","he said to the angel of Padua, “Anthony, I appoint you     as distributor of my providence to this pious institution     for the interests of Jesus' Heart!” (S.C. Vol. 3, page 270).             Somewhere  else the  Father  touches  again     upon the same subject. “We are intimately convinced     that St. Joseph won for us St. Anthony's protection.     Rather, we think that St. Joseph himself, as the universal     patron of the Church, gave the devotion of St. Anthony's     bread to the peoples of these last times to console any     class of persons” (Ibid. page 249).             The Daughters of the Sacred Side testify     beautifully, “He was so fond of St. Joseph! He wrote to     us to our communities under the protection of the saint.     He celebrated, and made people celebrate his feast with     a novena and dinner for the poor, where it was feeble.”              “He instilled this devotion to us, who were     needing the Father's help and were in the condition     to  better  appreciate  his  precious  trust in  the  holy     Patriarch.”             Mother Quaranta bears the following     witness, “I still have to say of his great devotion and     trust  to  St.  Joseph.  He  exhorted  us  to  have  a  tender,     simple, ingenuous devotion to the holy Patriarch.              “According to his way of thinking, when     in need, we should pray to the saint heartily and     insistently, even by threatening him taking away the     child Jesus, or covering him with paper, until he helps     us. The Servant of God wanted us to eat bread of wheat     (it was around 1913); wheat came in.      48","He also wanted us to eat fruit every day, even     though we had no money to buy it, fruit never failed.     Sometimes, oil for St. Joseph helped us.”             Mother Quaranta related the above     evidences many times to me in detail, and I quote     them.              The Father saw the sisters eating the     uneatable bread, and said, “Daughters, bread is to be     of pure wheat, otherwise you are unable to work.”             “Who gives us such bread?”             “Ask St. Joseph for it; rather, you place an     empty open sack under St. Joseph's picture, and he will     provide you.”             We did so. Because the building was poor,     and one room served as a parlor, laboratory, and     refectory, whoever came in saw the empty open sack     under St. Joseph's picture.             In those days, the doctor happened to pass     by, and smiled at the singular expedient. “The fact is     that rich man left a big gold coin, such as,” said Mother     Quaranta, “we never saw. As the rich man went out, a     lady came in to offer some wheat!”             Thus, St. Joseph answered the Father's     trust, and the doctor felt himself drawn to a greater     devotion to the saint, when he knew these happenings.                                            49","THE ROGATIONISTS          he Congregation of the Rogationists of the Heart     Tof Jesus (RCJ), is a Religious  Clerical Institute  of     apostolic life and pontifical right, which are composed of     both priests and brothers.      With joy, zeal and dedication, they respond to the call to     constantly  become  a  living  memory  of  the  Lord  Jesus     Christ – his way of being and acting through the public     profession of the evangelical counsels of chastity, poverty,     and obedience. Their goal is to grow in perfect charity, as     Jesus himself taught his disciples.     Their  Founder,  St.  Hannibal  Mary  Di  Francia  received     a precious inspiration from the Holy Spirit, the Rogate;     “Pray (Rogate) therefore to the Lord of the harvest  so     that he may send out laborers into his harvest”(Mt. 9:37-     38, Lk. 10:2). That is why they devote themselves to a     fourth vow, that is, the understanding of and zeal for the     Rogate. It is in accordance to this charism that they live     their consecration, and be dedicated to the building up       50","of the Church and to the salvation of the world, at the     service of the Kingdom of God.      The religious family started as a “small caravan” on May     16, 1897 with the vesting of religious habit of the first     three brothers. These were the first ones who wore the     emblem sown on the cassock they received, which gave     the distinguishing mark of this humble beginnings. On a     cloth was printed a heart with the following inscription     “Rogate Ergo Dominum Messis  Ut Mittat Operarios     In Messem Suam” (“Pray therefore to the Lord of the     harvest to send out laborers into his harvest”). In these     words, the Congregation finds its identity and spirituality.     The Founder himself remindshis spiritual sons:      “Now, here is a new community just being born which     comes forth in the Church…It needs intelligent generous     people, who understand not only its sacred mission of     charity towards the neighbor, like all the other modern     institutions, but also of that divine holy word that makes     it unique and special: Rogate ergo.” (St. Hannibal Mary     Di Francia, Letters)                                                    51","Provincial             Rogate Vocation Center            Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus               ST.
