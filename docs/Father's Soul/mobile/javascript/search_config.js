EDITED BY                          Sister Corinne Clay, O.S.B.                                          GENERAL CURIA OF THE ROGATIONISTS FATHERS","2                                   With the approbation of the Superior General                     Fr. Pietro Cifuni R.C.J.","September 8, 1973                     Birth of Mary                      Rome                               To the Father's sons and daughters:                       THE  FATHER'S  SOUL  is  such  an  alluring  title  as  to  raise                     thrilling  expectations,  which  could  end  in  disappointment,                     however.                           To avoid it, we specify that this work is not concerned with the                     Father's  psychology,  which  deserves  a  research  from                                 3                     professionals.  We  hope  that  one  day  some  of  our  brethren  will                      undertake  it  gladly.  Being  the  psychological  aim  beyond  my                     intentions, and I am not qualified for such a work, I have confined                     myself  within  the  bounds  of  a  humble  collector  of  documents,                      which will enable the experts to weave the story.                          Therefore,  I  beg  the  readers  to  emphasize  the  sub-title:                      Witnesses,  because  I  aim  at  making  the  people  know  how  the                     persons who lived, or knew the Father, have judged him. After the                     Father's  death,  the  superiors  gathered  the  evidence  from  those                     who had spontaneously written concerning him, or were invited                      to do so. Such reports deserve our trust even though they are not                     sworn upon.","I  myself  bear  witness  to  some  episodes,  while  other  events                     have been related to me by reliable persons.                           Logically,  I  could  not  neglect  the  evidence  that  the  Father                     himself has prompted to us through his own writings, which like a                     mirror reflect his soul.                           Because Father Vitale has employed some of the documents in                      Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di  Francia  -  his  Life  and  Works,  my                     project  is  not  entirely  original.  Still,  with  the  blessing  of  the  o                     Bambinella  Mary,))  we  hope  it  will  help  the  communities  by                     kindling in our hearts the wish to imitate our Father, becoming                      sons and daughters worthy of him.

Notes.","1. Becoming always a convert                             Usually,  we  combine  the  idea  of  conversion  with  the  idea  of  a  previous                     sinful life from which people recede. For instance, when we talk of conversion,                     the image of Mary Magdalene from whom the Lord had cast out seven devils                     (Mk. 16,9), as well as the image of Augustine who surrendered to the grace after                     30 years of corruption cross our mind immediately.                         By  itself,  however,  conversion  does  not  imply  moral  corruption.  For                     instance,  Saint  Paul  was  obstinate  because  of  his  extreme  enthusiasm  for  the                     traditions  of  his  ancestors  (Gal.  1,  14).  Saint  Gabriel  of  Our  Lady  of  Sorrow                     converted from worldliness, in which he lived indulgently without jeopardizing            14                     his Christian duties; Saint Louis Gonzaga called the year he spent in Florence «                     year of his conversion, » because Our Lady increased his fervor in that time, and                     yet he lived his youth innocently and angelically. Saint Theresa of the child Jesus                     received the grace of conversion on Christmas night 1886, when Jesus « changed                     her heart, » giving her the « spiritual courage she had lost at the age of four and                     half.  Such  gift  she  retained  ever  since  »  (Autobiographical  manuscripts,  page                     122). People's fancy could freely play on « this spiritual courage, » but history                     tells us that detachment from the Christmas gifts was the point!                         Because  conversion  starts  a  dynamic  process,  a  growth,  a  continuous                     increase in the spiritual life, people look at it from its goal and from its aim. Let                     us call to mind Saint Paul's saying: « You must run ...meaning to wino (1 Cor. 9,                     24). He says of himself. « That is how I run, intent on winning; that is how I                     fight, not beating the air,...because I should not want to be disqualified » (Ibid.                     vv. 26-27).                         Surrendering  oneself  to  God  and  to  his  grace;  persisting  on  achieving                     spiritual growth for holiness; continuously renewing the resolve to become holy,                     that is what conversion is all about.","Ascetics distinguish the first conversion from the second one. In the former, a                     person settles in the grace of God; in the latter, he commits himself to perfection,                     according to the gospel. We quote the following episode: « So he called a little                     child to him and set the child in front of them. Then he said solemnly, \" Unless                     you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of                     heaven  \"  »  (Mat.  18,  2-3).  «  Here,  Jesus  is  speaking  to  the  apostles  who  are                     sharing  in  his  ministry,  who  will  receive  Communion  at  the  Last  Supper,  and                     three of them have been with him on Tabor. They are in the state of grace, and                     yet he speaks to them of the necessity to convert in order to enter the kingdom, i.                     e.,  the  divine  intimacy  »  (GARRIGOU-LAGRANGE,  The  Three  Ages  of  the                     Spiritual  Life,  book  3,  ch.  2).  To  be  specific,  the  scholars  define  the  second                     conversion as the state of a person who transfers from the purgative life to the                     illuminative one.                          The second conversion which the Father invokes continuously with tears has                     an ampler meaning; it engages all of his life and strength. Conversion for him is                     « hunger and thirst for what is right >> (Mat. 5, 6), which we cannot satisfy in                     full on earth! He writes:                          The persons committed to the divine service are like those who are going to                     some destination. The more they think of the short way they have covered and of                     the long way to be traversed, the more they hasten toward their goal. The same            15                     happens to those who are in the mystical way of the virtue. If we think of having                     covered a long way, because we have taken some steps in this regal path, and if                     we think of being on top of the virtue when we are at its foot, we run the risk of                     loosing  our  fervor  and  our  zeal,  slowing  down.  Meanwhile  death  comes  and                     breaks our journey at the beginning of our way! Therefore, the consideration of                     how  little  we  have  done  and  of  the  great  deal  to  be  done  helps  us  always  to                     perform  better  things.  It  is  useless  to  say  that  seeing  things  in  such  a  way                     degrades the soul; this is true for those who are seeking themselves, not for those                     who are  seeking God. God wants our resolve:  « Once the  hand is laid on the                     plough, no one who looks back is fit for the kingdom of God >> (Lk. 9, 62).                     David said, « Today I start! » (Ps. 76, 11) (1) (Vol. 22, page 72).                         When  the  Father  was  a  boy,  he  was  drawn  to  commit  himself  to  piety,                     nourishing  a  special  devotion  to  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament  and  to  the  most  holy                     Virgin.  Even  though  he  had  not  yet  received  divine  enlightenment  on  his                     vocation, he felt himself drawn to a great union with God. Ever since he retired                     from attending the theater where Maieroni recited, and gave up bird hunting, a                     diversion he used to do now and then with his relatives in the","near country. He went more often to the churches, especially the ones having the                     Blessed Sacrament exposed, and in the time when Jesus was alone. Those were                     the  best  hours  when  he  even  gave  vocal  free  play  to  his  soul.  This  is  his                     conversion. Ever since he strove continuously and untiringly to grow in holiness.                          I relate the episode Canon Barsanofio Chieti told us. While walking together                     with the venerable Bishop Di Tommaso along the avenue of Oria station, they                     saw  the  Father  coming  with  difficulty  -  he  was  in  the  last  years  of  his  life.                     Pointing to the Father, the bishop said to Canon Barsanofio, « That man wants to                     become  holy  at  any  cost!>>  He  was  referring  to  the  Father's  strength  and                     perseverance in pursuing holiness.                          The Father, however, was unaware. He rather thought of having buried the                     divine gift, of having disregarded the plans of God, of being tardy in the path of                     his life. Like a lazy worker, he saw himself as letting the weed and the thorns                     suffocate the good seed that the Lord had abundantly sown in his soul. Not to be                     deceived  by  him  when  he  calls  himself  «  a  wretch,  a  monster  of  iniquity,  the                     most unjust man, » and the like, we must always bear in our mind that this was                     the habitual state of his spirit, which is common to all the Servants of God.                          When the saints speak of themselves, they are severe judges. Listen to Saint          16                     Bernard: « How many useless, false, and unbecoming things I have vomited from                     my loathsome mouth! » (Lectures on Our lady's feasts, Pauline Editions, page                     155). The humble saint calls his famous lectures on the topic Missus est useless,                     false, and loathsome. And yet, these lectures are among the most beautiful pages                     that the holy Fathers ever wrote in honor of the most holy Mother!                          The Father insisted by words and by writing, « Do not forget to pray to the                     Lord and to the most holy Virgin for my true conversion >> (Vol. 35, page 1). «                     Pray for my conversion. >> The people who marveled at his request, were told                     again, « All of us need conversion until the last moment of our life... Though we                     may  have  achieved  a  high  degree  of  virtue,  still  it  costs  exertion  and                     renunciation...  The  Lord  tests  our  faithfulness  in  the  battle,  whence  the  merit                     springs. » Writing to Father Callisto Bonicelli in August 1906, he wishes that the                     Monfort  be  canonized,  and  adds,  «  But  he  must  work  some  miracles,  and  the                     miracle  of  my  conversion  will  be  a  resounding  one  which  would  exempt  him                     from any other! » (S.C. Vol. 7, page 145).","2. The prayers for the conversion                             Unless  the  grace  of  God  helps  us,  we  can  do  nothing.  OuR  Lord  states                     explicitly, « Cut off from me, you can do nothing » (John 15,5); and Saint Paul                     writes, « No one can say, \" Jesus is Lord \" unless he is under the influence of the                     Holy Spirit >> (1 Cor. 12, 3). Still less can we think of the conversion as a work                     of ours: « It is God, for his loving purpose, who put both the will and the action                     into  you » (Phil. 2, 13). For this reason the prophet implored from the Lord,«                     Bring me back, let me come back » (Jer. 31, 18).                          The Father held the conversion as the outcome of the prayer. Through many                     prayers, therefore, he meant to force heaven to grant it to him. We quote some                     gleanings from his various, long prayers, picking up some periods particularly                     interesting. He resorts to the Lord, the Madonna, the angels, and his dear patron                     saints with such an impetus, fervor, and fire that he sometimes seems to mobilize                     all of paradise.                          On February 2, 1887, he begins the offering of 33 masses asking for. 1. The                     grace that the divine majesty likes most in order to better achieve sanctification.                     2.  The  true,  sincere,  fervid,  constant  conversion  of  himself  to  the  supreme    17                     goodness,  Jesus.  3.  The  gift  of  making  his  frequent,  clear,  detailed  confession                     with compunction, humility, sorrow, and resolve. 4. The divine forgiveness for                     not having answered the new call quickly because of laziness. 5. The effective                     grace to perfectly answer the new call (Vol. 4, page 13).                          He appeals to the Heart of Jesus, « Do not let me be separated from you. O                     my Jesus, I want only you. May I die to creatures, and creatures to me. May I                     truly say, \" I only glory in the cross of my Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the                     world is crucified to me, and I to the world \" » (Book 6, page 9).                          To the child Jesus:                          My dear Jesus, please convert all of myself to you. I want to belong to you,                     knowing and loving you so much in this life, both because you deserve it and                     because  I  want  to  know  and  love  you  so  much  in  heaven.  I  mourn  over  my                     enormous sins, and desire to atone for your love I outraged and betrayed! I want                     to  detach  myself  from  any  creature,  to  destroy  my  worst  nature,  and  to  unite                     myself to you by love. May the great miracle of your eternal charity come true; i.                     e., the guilty soul of","this most wretched among all human beings and the perfect soul of the holy of                     the holies may be one... But I am not satisfied by loving you superficially. I want                     to  love  you  with  a  particular,  burning,  devouring  love  stronger  than  death,  in                     order to penetrate and to burn the senses of my spirit, the fibers of my heart, and                     the marrow of my soul. May this love be the spirit of my life. May it consume,                     regenerate, and transform me into you. My Jesus, I want to love you so strongly                     and fervently, with the charity of your loving heart that no one, except your most                     holy Mother and the glorious Saint Joseph, may say that he loves you more than                     me!... Give me your love with unlimited generosity. King of eternal origin, let                     me  enter  your  winery  and  elate  me  with  charity!  Make  me  strong  enough  to                     destroy myself in order to face suffering, mockery, and any opposition with love.                     Please do yourself for me what I don't know how, cannot, and don't want to do...                     My Jesus, convert all of myself to you: gather my thoughts in your presence, for                     they are spread like water running through the streets! Fix my mind in you, for it                     withers day by day. Heavenly Doctors, place my ulcerated heart in your hands                     and cure it quickly with the salutary balm of your grace, as you did with leprous                     men... O God, create a pure heart, and renew an upright spirit in me: a humble,                     meek,  docile,  simple,  contrite,  ardent,  strong  heart;  sensitive  to  the  gentlest                     motions  of  your  grace;  compassionate  for  your  sorrows;  insensible  to  any                     uncharitable affection; and sharing in the feelings, the sorrows, and the secrets of                     your loving heart! My child, hear the inexpressible wail of my spirit; hear me,           18                     hear me, hear me. Amen. Amen. Amen.                          He insists on begging the grace from the child Jesus through the intercession                     of the vast paradise:                          I beg  you to grant  me this grace for  your  sake, for the sake of the Virgin                     Mary, your Mother and mine; for the sake of the glorious Saint Joseph; for the                     sake  of  Magdalene,  John  the  Baptizer,  Peter,  Paul,  Francis  of  Assisi,  Teresa,                     Peter of Alcantara, the Capuchin Veronica, and Saint Alphonsus M. Liguori. My                     Jesus,  saint  of  the  saints,  angel  of  the  great  council;  for  the  sake  of  the  holy                     martyrs, the holy confessors, the holy virgins, all saints, and all angels, hear me,                     hear me, hear me. Amen. Amen. Amen !!! (Ibid. page 136).                          How tenderly he resorts to the Madonna!                          O Immaculate Heart of Mary, convert me to the most holy Heart of Jesus !...                     Immaculate  Heart  of  Mary,  deliver  me  to  Jesus,  who  made  me  his  prey  and                     minister; deliver this lost sheep to the Good Shepherd; deliver this prodigal son                     to the loving Father! I return worn-out, wounded","and  dirty!  True  Rebecca,  cover  me  with  the  merits  of  the  purest  lamb;  please                     cure, purify, and set me free to Jesus! Break any string tying me to creatures so                     that I may say, « My string is broken, and I am free! \" My deliverer, redemptrix,                     mediatrix,  and  Lady,  you  did  not  stop  loving  me!  Therefore,  I  do  not  stop                     trusting in you! Mary, my hope, let me totally belong to Jesus!)> , (Ibid. page 9).                          Elsewhere:                          Do  not  look  at  my  demerits,  my  most  holy  Mother;  I  should  cooperate                     efficaciously  to  convert  myself  to  God,  but  I  often  do  quite  the  opposite,                     becoming  unworthy  of  the  grace  of  a  sincere  conversion.  This  is  the  reason  I                     resort to you, my most holy and loving Mother. Be pleased with this prayer that I                     am addressing to you from the innermost of my heart; may it be a complete and                     effective cooperation to the grace of conversion. Do not ask me for anything else,                     because  I  am  unable  to  it;  may  your  merits  before  your  Son  make  up  for  my                     demerits (Ibid. page 120).                          To Saint Joseph:                          O  very  glorious,  powerful  Patriarch  Saint  Joseph,  I  come  to  your  feet  to                     submit the needs of my soul to you... O holy patriarch, I tell your fatherly heart                     that I want Jesus only; may I die to all creatures, and all creatures to me... Set me     19                     free  from  the  hellish  wolf's  snares  and  from  the  consequences  of  my  nasty                     behavior... O glorious patriarch, hear my poor, ardent prayer for the sake of the                     loving Jesus, for the sake of Immaculate Mary, for the sake of your paternity of                     the  Son  of  God,  and  for  the  sake  of  your  inestimable  privilege  of  being  the                     spouse of the Immaculate Mother of God. Amen (Vol. 6, pages 10, 11).                          To the Guardian Angel:                          Abstract me from the vile transitory things of this poor world. Loose me from                     the  worldly  bonds  originated  from  my  sins...  correct  me  with  your  heavenly,                     effective inspirations... speak strongly and effectively to my heart in order that I                     avoid the bad  suggestions  of the devil and of nature, but follow  your salutary                     counsels!... Fix my thoughts in the loving Jesus in such a way that I never depart                     from his presence. Being free from any earthly attachment I may seek, long, sigh,                     find, embrace, and possess only Jesus, only Jesus, only Jesus ! See to it that I                     languish and die out of love for Jesus only! Please kindle in my heart a holy,                     living flame for the loving Jesus, so that my affections, suffering, and wishes be                     for Jesus only, completely forgetting all creatures and myself (Ibid. page 12).","To Saint Raphael, physician of God:                          My spirit is sick. Please give me the heavenly drugs to cure it. A deprived                     spirit  surrounds  me;  please  remove  it  with  your  powerful  hand,  casting  it  far                     away, and keeping it from tormenting me. Defend and free me from the ancient                     murderer. Preserve and keep safe even my temporal health in order that I may be                     faithful  in  the  divine  service  and  in  my  priestly  duties  of  justice  and  charity                     (Ibid.).                           3. Resorting to the saints                              The Father's resorting to the patronage of the saints in the events of his life                     depended on his devotion to them and on his trust in their intercession. We can           20                     imagine                         how fervently he engaged them to attain the grace of his conversion !                          He wrote six prayers to Saint Alphonsus to attain the conversion, asking for a                     grace so < effective and triumphant, » that he might not resist to it: « Obtain for                     me living enlightenment and affection so that I may know myself and God, and                     make the decision of becoming holy... See to it that I belong totally to Jesus as a                     priest of Jesus Christ must, and as he wants » (Vol. 6, pages 124, 125).                          To Saint Veronica Giuliani: « O my particular advocate and protectress, your                     Crucified Love showed you his holy wounds, saying that he would grant you any                     grace through them. I beseech you: pray, entreat Jesus, our supreme goodness, to                     grant me the following grace: my sincere conversion... » (Ibid. page 128).                          While in rapture, Saint Veronica found herself in the presence of our Lord,                     who asked her to make a general confession of her sins in the presence of the                     most holy Virgin Mary and her patron saints. After doing so with great confusion                     and contrite heart, Jesus forgave her sins in full through the intercession of the                     most  holy  Virgin,  making  the  saint  very  happy.  Then  Jesus  dismissed  her  by                     saying: « Go in peace, do not sin any more! »","Such  forgiveness  the  Father  implores  through  a  long  prayer  to  the  saint,                     entreating her: « Grant me the grace of making a general confession of my entire                     life at the feet of the minister of God: an entire, humble, clear, detailed, exact,                     precise, sorrowful confession of the sins I have unluckily committed in my life. »                     He also asks the favor of becoming such a priest as the saint wants the priests to                     be while ministering the most holy Eucharist:                          I beg and entreat  you  for the sake of  your spouse in the Sacrament: make                     haste to help me, the poor! Obtain for me fire and flames, flames and fire ! See to                     it that I become such a priest as you think the priests who minister the divine                     mysteries every day should be! In the solemn moment when the Word of God                     made man descends from heaven to earth on the altar, through the words of this                     poor wretch... in that solemn moment may I be transmuted in the infinite God                     who hides and annihilates himself out of love! May I then become living fire of                     charity, burning with ardent love! (Ibid. pages 129-130).                          To Saint John of the Cross:                          « ... I beg you to obtain for me the conversion I long for: the divine union of                     love  with  the  supreme  goodness,  Jesus,  the  favor  to  walk  on  the  path  of  the                     divine will, the grace to mortify, overcome myself, and to leave everything in                     order to find God » (S.C. 10, page 3). Furthermore: « I beg you to obtain the             21                     conversion I long for and the grace to begin a new life through the mortification                     of the senses, mind, memory and will, in order to achieve the perfect union of                     love with Jesus, through the work of grace and my own cooperation. » Because                     he must be a model in the community, he worries and prays: « I beg you to let                     me avoid those defects which scandalize the poor and the children, keeping me                     from grieving the most holy Heart of Jesus even in the least. Lead me to perfect                     detachment  from  everything;  and  in  my  suffering  and  any  test  be  my  guide,                     comfort, help, support and teacher o (Vol. 6, pages 14-15).                         He  relies  on  Saint  Placid  under  a  gracious  pretext:  «  It  is  true  that  I  am                     plunged into tepidity, indifference, negligence, bad habits and defects, but also                     you were plunged into the water when God's omnipotent hand pulled you out. »                     Then he implores the miracle for himself. « Come to the water of my iniquity and                     save me so that I may belong totally to Jesus >> (S.C. 10, page 11).                         In the original prayer to Saint Anthony of Padua, he interprets in a way of his                     own the saint's privilege to find the lost things - resque perditas - We quote it                     entirely:                         O beloved of God, O sublime and glorious saint, wonder-worker, benefactor                     of  the  people  and  my  benign  benefactor!  Rapid  hearer  of  those","who implore you, I kiss your feet that always walked to spread goodness and to                     evangelize the peace; wailing and sighing, I resort to you for help. For the sake                     of your love toward Jesus, obtain from divine mercy the restoration of my lost                     inheritance so that God, who is the inheritance of the elects, return to me with all                     the favors, mercies, and blessings which I have dispersed or didn't deserve! You                     cannot deny me this favor, O glorious wonder-worker, because those who resort                     to  you to recover their lost things are granted the  grace of recovering them. I                     myself am a witness along with the seraphic Bonaventure who wrote: « Resque                     perditas  petunt  et  accipiunt  iuvenes  et  cani  ».  Then,  if  you  are  so  eager  for                     helping people find their lost things, sometimes the least ones, how is it possible                     that you are so reluctant to help the persons who want to recover their lost graces,                     the  rejected  mercies,  when  they  are  contrite  and  pierced  by  sorrow?  Oh,  it  is                     impossible that you are indifferent to them! I am sure, very sure, because if you                     are able to make the people find their trifles, you are abler to make them recover                     the heavenly treasures unhappily and unluckily lost! Wailing at your feet, I resort                     to your power and entreat you: O glorious saint, let me find my lost inheritance!                     Tu es qui restitues haereditatem meam mihi ! Let me find the Supreme Goodness                     I searched for in vain until now, because I searched for him coldly. I forced him                     to leave me by dint of disgust and unfaithfulness! You can deny me the treasures                     of grace and glory I have unluckily lost, but let me find my Supreme Goodness!                     Oh,  give  me  back  Jesus.  Let  me  recover  Jesus,  my  God,  my  creator,  and  my                     savior!!!                                                                                 22                          O my glorious Saint Anthony, please pray, pray for me! Do not stop praying                     for me until I obtain my lost inheritance and when I obtain it, see to it that I never                     lose it again. Amen. Amen (S.C. Vol. 10. page 46).                          How many are the saints of Messina enjoying the glory in paradise? Don't                     they feel obliged to help a fellow-citizen who appeals to them? He invokes the                     saint priests, martyrs, virgins, penitents, and the triumphant church of Messina by                     saying:                          My dear saints of Messina, who were born, lived, and became holy here, I                     appeal to you to attain the effective grace of the new, true conversion to God.                     Remember that I am a fellow-citizen of yours and a son of the Messina church. I                     really need a true, intimate detachment from creatures and conversion to God!                     For this I entreat you, my dear saints of Messina! (Ibid. page 12).                          On  January  15,  1888,  Leo  XIII  canonized  a  group  of  saints:  the  Seven                     Founders  of  the  Servants  of  Mary  along  with  Saint  Peter  Claver,  Saint  John                     Berchmans, and Saint Alphonsus Rodriguez. The Father considered that event as                     a wonderful opportunity","ity to take advantage of the saints' intercession! After congratulating them upon                     their canonization which was for the glory of God and the salvation of souls, he                     humbly prayed to them for the Pope, the holy Church, and for his conversion:                          O neo-saints, kneeling at your sacred feet I entreat you from the innermost of                     my  heart  to  grant  me  a  sincere  and  profound  conversion.  Please  obtain  the                     conversion I long for, because I languish! I am a priest, but I have betrayed my                     divine Savior as Judas did; I have denied him as Peter did; I have blasphemed                     him  as  the  two  crucified  thieves  did!  O  my  dear  saints,  look  at  my  extreme                     misery from your eternal glory, from your high happiness, and have mercy on                     me!  Plunged  into  the  mire,  worn-out,  wounded,  poor,  sick,  oppressed,  in  debt                     with the divine justice, deaf, mute, blind, leprous, paralytic and perhaps fetid as a                     four day dead, customary sinner, obstinate, relapsing, overflowing with malice: I                     fall  at  your  feet  imploring  grace  and  mercy  from  your  kindness  and  charity!                     Please  pray,  pray  efficaciously  to  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  and  to  the                     Immaculate Heart of Mary for my true conversion! Grant me such a conversion                     to atone for my nasty behavior following upon my first conversion! Grant me the                     second conversion by shaking, permeating, and restoring me to God and to his                     love. Captivate and render me a victim of his divine will! If my unworthiness,                     bad habits, perfidious will, corrupt nature, and aged malice are such that I am                     unable to convert, your powerful intercession, O glorious neo-saints, can obtain                     the effective grace to convert me! What favor can the sweetest Heart of Jesus             23                     deny you? What the most merciful Heart of Immaculate Mary ? Everything is                     granted to the neo-saints who go before the throne of mercy! Therefore, pray,                     pray efficaciously for this wretch, obtain for me the desired conversion! I beg                     you  for  the  sake  of  Jesus,  you  loved  so  much  on  earth;  for  the  sake  of                     Immaculate Mary, to whom you were fervently devout. Hear me, hear me! Dear                     neo-saints, hurry up, obtain my sincere, intimate, and perfect conversion to God!                     Amen. Amen (Ibid. pages 17-18).                             4. Holiness without illusion                             The  continuous  longing  for  conversion  turns  into  the  intimate,  profound,                     constant wish                         for holiness. The Father implores the conversion with all his soul. He writes                     in a prayer: « I put myself at disposal of your divine will. My Jesus, see to it that                     I serve you faithfully. Render me apt for your divine service. I beg you to give                     me holy virtues,","especially humility, obedience, and holy detachment from earthly things. Give                     me the holy fear of you, your love, and the desire to become holy and to belong                     totally to you. My Jesus, concentrate my thoughts on you when I pray. » He asks                     the Madonna for the same grace, and concludes with the ejaculatory prayer, < O                     Mary, my mother, let me belong totally to Jesus! » To Saint Joseph, « I long for                     becoming holy, for belonging to Jesus totally, and for serving him according to                     his will in this pious institute. Please grant me these favors so that Jesus may act                     with this wretch as he wants » (Vol. 4, page 18).                          What is holiness about?                          The Father writes,                          According  to  the  shallow  view  of  some  persons,  holiness  cannot  stand                     without a long retinue of severe penances, of transcendent deeds and works, of                     wonders and first rate miracles. But they are wrong.                         Holiness is the perfect union of our will with God's will out of love for him                     and  of  pure  intention  in  order  to  please  his  divine  majesty.  When  a  person                     achieves this happiest state, he only longs for hiding together with his beloved. In                     such  a  case  this  person  does  not  need  to  work  great  wonders  through  the                     suspension  of  the  law  of  nature,  because  he  has  already  worked  the  greatest                     among the miracles by giving up himself to God. The people can say of him, «              24                     His glory is within him. » And that person can exclaim, « My life is hidden in                     Christ o (Vol. 45, page 132).                          The Father aimed at this sort of holiness, and he pledged himself for it, as the                     following prayer testifies:                          Lord Jesus, for the sake of your mercy let me perceive the motions of my                     nature  and  of  the  temptations,  and  give  me  the  grace  to  detest  and  overcome                     them.  Let  me  also  perceive  the  motions  of your  grace  so  that  I  correspond  to                     them.                         Lord,  I  beseech  you,  help  me  elude  the  motions  of  nature,  the  inclination,                     whim, passion, my own will, and the hellish suggestion; and help me follow the                     move  and  the  guidance  of  your  Holy  Spirit  as  you  did.  May  the  same  Spirit                     guide, lead, enliven, and let me belong to you, let me know the path leading to                     you. Free me from my enemies, for I have appealed to you; teach me to do your                     will, because you are my God. See to it that I may comply with your Father's will                     with fullness of sentiment and affection as you did on earth.                          My Jesus, may no thing on earth be of value for me, except you.","Close my eyes to vanity, but open them in order that I may see you in everything.                     Close  my  mouth  to  the  malicious  words  which  offend  charity,  prudence,  and                     simplicity, opening it to speak of you and to sing your praise. Close my ears to                     the voice of nature, selfishness, passions, and temptations which whisper, trying                     to seduce me; but let them hear your sweetest voice in order to follow your will                     in everything. Keep my hands from performing noxious and unjust works, being                     at your disposal to do what you like. Keep my feet far from the path of fallacy,                     deceit, and iniquity, and let them always follow you, the purest truth.                          My Jesus, do not abandon me, do not leave me in my own hands, because if                     you leave me for a moment, I will fall into a thousand defects, precipices, and                     mistakes. Jesus, accept me as your disciple. Be my teacher. Instruct and lead me                     to the path of perfection and holiness. Let me achieve through your guidance the                     perfection you want from me. My Jesus, place true holiness in my heart, that I                     may not feed on selfishness and passion, nor satisfy my senses and illusion, but                     follow your loving spirit, which only you may give. Amen (Vol. 6, page 135). (2)                             5. His own cooperation                                                                25                              Holiness  is  from  God,  who  demands  the  cooperation  of  man.  The  first,                     indispensable form of cooperation is given by prayer, which enables the people                     to  grow  in  the  grace  and  to  become  stronger.  Prayer  must  be  combined  with                     works, however.                          Saint  Bernard  teaches,  «  Not  going  forward  in  the  way  of  the  spirit  is                     recoiling,  because  we  cannot  keep  still.  Perfection  demands  of  us  to  always                     stretch forth (cf. Phil. 3, 13), to continuously long for doing better, confident in                     the divine mercy, which cures our failings. We must avoid deceiving ourselves                     by  thinking  of  having  achieved  perfection  »  (Sermons  for  the  Feasts  of  the                     Madonna, Pauline Editions, 1970, page 282).                          The Father was engaged to seek perfection in everything, letting any grace be                     fruitful, and giving a personal interpretation to the following words of our Lord:                     « What, then, will a man gain if he wins the whole world and ruins his life ? »                     (Mt. 16, 26). For ruin, the Father did not mean the perdition of the soul, but any                     prejudice, because the acquisition of the whole world would end in a pure loss if                     it would happen to the prejudice of the soul,","even in the least.                          As the' prophet carried his soul in his hands (Ps. 118, 109), so the Father was                     sedulously attentive to purify and to render his soul more acceptable to the Lord                     by the practice of the virtues, which he continuously implored from God. In a                     prayer he says; « O sweetest child Jesus, kneeling before your cradle, I present                     my poor heart and all myself to you... My Jesus, sanctify me. For the sake of                     your incarnation and birth, please grant me the following: 1. Pure intention. 2.                     Detachment.  3.  Sorrow  for  my  sins.  4.  The  grace  to  know  and  see  the  living                     saints for my spiritual profit. 5. Holy humility. 6. A holy death. 7. The spirit of                     prayer. 8. Faith, hope, and charity. 9. Love for you, Saint Joseph, and Mary »                     (Vol. 6, page 28).                          Prayer to the child Jesus to be liberated from the earthly affections:                          O my blessed Jesus, child of my heart, do not leave me alone! For the sake of                     your holy infancy, free me from all the earthly affections!... You see how my                     heart  is  bound,  unable,  and  poor!  O  heavenly  child,  put  your  love  within  my                     heart. May your love burn any earthly affection in me by burning my soul! Oh! if                     only I loved you, my Jesus! If I had the heart of the saints and the angels to love                     you! Oh ! how little do I love you! My love, my child, I know that you love me;                     therefore, see to it that I return your love! My Jesus, where are you ? Soul of my        26                     soul, where have you hidden yourself, leaving me alone in my inability ? I know                     that I am good for nothing; I know and confess it! But you, my child, you can do                     everything. Take my poor heart in your hands, put it in your purest heart, kindle                     it with the love of the  cherubim and seraphim, and  destroy  in  me  any  earthly                     affection so that I may say,                         My sweetest loves, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, I belong to you, not at all to me;                     I suffer and die for you! » (Vol. 4, page 1).                          We  read  in  his  notes  a  work  schedule  for  his  spiritual  growth.  To  be                     illuminated, he premises an invocation, < Show me the way in which I should                     walk » (Ps. 143, 8). Then he notes: I. Sacrifice. 2. Humiliation or abject poverty.                     Beggary. 3. Interior mortification. 4. Annihilation in God. 5. Silent patience. 6.                     Silence. 7. Calm in the oppositions. 8. Patience and meekness with the poor and                     children, gently coping with the latter. 9. Prudence and prudent demeanor. 10.                     Vocal and written prayer. 11. Spiritual reading. 12. Detachment from comfort,                     especially from food and bad habits. 13. Mortification of impulses, anxiety,","and worries. 14. Sorrow and fear of past sins, as well as redemption of the past                     life. 15. Interior tribulation and spirit of compunction. 16. Patience when I see                     my work lost. 17. Perfect union with the commanding or permitting divine will.                     18.  Suppression  of,  or  refrainment  from  giving  free  play  in  the  oppositions  »                     (S.C. 10, page 2).                          On November 20, 1889, he implores the redemption of his past life from the                     Lord:                          Oh,  my  Jesus,  who  can  give  me  the  power  to  give  up  my  life  in  order  to                     redeem  the  time  I  have  lost?  Who  gives  me  again  the  fine  opportunities  to                     practice patience, humility, contempt of myself, through which I could have died                     to myself in order to live in the knowledge and in the divine union with  you,                     supreme  goodness?  I  have  lost  the  most  beautiful  of  my  years  in  idleness,                     dissipation,  distraction,  ignorance,  indifference,  and  defects,  making  the  Holy                     Spirit wail in my heart! I have neglected so many graces, inspirations, and gentle                     impulses through which you called me to you, O supreme goodness! My Lord                     and my God, now I am confused at your feet, imploring mercy! As the prodigal                     son, I return to the loving father, saying, \" I have sinned against you and heaven!                     \"  I  am  unworthy  to  be  called  your  son;  place  me  at  work  as  the  last  of  your                     servants.                                                                                                               27                         Meanwhile, he thinks of having deprived God of the glory that God expected                     from him; therefore, he prays to the Lord to make up for his failure by creating                     another man who will be faithful to God since his tender age, and continues: «                     My  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  God  of  all  mercies,  I  beg  you  to  redeem  my  past  life.                     Endow another person with your particular blessing from his                         tender  age;  redouble  the  graces,  the  inspirations,  and  the  impulses  I                     disregarded; lead this soul through an irresistible gentleness to the divine union                     of love, to which you would have guided me, if I had answered your grace! »                     (S.C. page 27).                          He chooses the following saints as his patrons during Lent time: John of the                     Cross, Dominic, Anthony of Padua, Alphonsus M. Liguori, Camillus de Lellis,                     Theresa, Veronica Giuliani, Catherine of Siena, Blessed Margaret Alacoque, and                     Eustochio.                          In  a  retreat  or  reflection  time,  in  September  of  the  same  year,  he  made                     additional resolves, whose aims are the following: « September 10, 1891: Aim of                     my resolves: 1. To become a perfect slave of the divine will under Jesus Christ's                     feet, being unknown and dead to everyone and to everything. 2. I will seek the                     pure love of God, for the sake of God. 3. To destroy the bad habits. 4. To cover                     the multitude of my sins. 5. To atone for the wrong","I have done to souls and the grief I have caused to the divine Heart. 6. To be                     helpful to my neighbor and to the house: a) To be edifying. b) To prepare myself                     for preaching, c) To obtain the divine mercy through prayer, wails, sighs, tears,                     penance, vigils, nightly prayers, etc. 7. To foster the pious institute in the most                     holy Heart of Jesus. 8. To answer the sublime call to priesthood. 9. To seek the                     eternal interests of Jesus » Heart (Ibid. page 35).                          In 1890 he opened his heart to his spiritual director:                          Father, I feel a great desire for Jesus Christ, and his divine presence is very                     pleasing to me. I wish I could do a great deal for his glory and for the salvation                     of  souls,  becoming  a  great  saint  to  achieve  this  goal.  But  my  miserable  state                     disheartens  me,  because  God  once  called  me  in  a  special  way,  and  I                     corresponded with him for some time. Later, however, I declined and heaped up                     such bad habits that now it is very difficult for me to become holy.                          The spiritual director responded to him,                          «  Ask  the  Lord  to  rehabilitate  you  in  his  grace,  and  humble  yourself.                     Humility must be interior and exterior. Humble yourself before God, imploring                     his mercy, and acknowledging that you are guilty of the state of your spirit. Serve                     your neighbor even in the most abject things, and be meek with people. »                  28                          « He exhorted me not to dishearten, because with God's help I can glorify                     him as he wants. As for the divine presence and my wishes, he told me to pray in                     order to increase them. »                          SUMMARY:  1.  Humility.  2.  Prayer.  3.  Humiliation.  4.  Meekness.  S.                     Courage and trust.                          « October 31, 1980, eve of all saints >> (Ibid, page 6).                          «  The  Father  is  ruthless  in  laying  bare  the  faulty  movements  of  the  spirit,                     laying the blame upon himself even for the miseries belonging to human needs.                     For instance, he lays the blame on himself for being a glutton, a sleeper, a lazy                     man; but, when a person works intensely, is it surprising that he happens to be                     hungry, sleepy, and tired, especially if he never eats nor sleeps to his 611, nor                     rests enough? In his retreat in Noto, he points out his chief defects: 1. Rising of                     anger.  2.  Little  mystifications.  3.  Grumbling  and  Jeering.  4.  Inclination  to                     speaking in order to say a joke, or express an opinion, or contradict someone, or","disclose a secret, or repel a reason, or give, free play. 5. Gluttony. 6. Sleep. 7.                     Laziness.  8.  Resentment  shown  by  indiscreet  zeal  because  of  selfishness.  9.                     Disregard of my duties and of the dutiful formalities. 10. Little respect for other                     people's property. 11. Antipathy, little aversions. 12. Little prides. 13. I dislike to                     be despised >> (S.C. Vol. 10, page 33).                          The little respect for other people's property is noteworthy when it is related                     to the Father who gave up all his own to other people, as well as the antipathy                     and little aversions when it is compared with the practice of the Father who spent                     his life in works of charity toward any class of people! But the Servants of God                     have a special enlightenment about the motions of their nature in order to abhor,                     submit, and overcome them through grace.                          To understand well how the father was engaged in bridling the impetus of                     irascibility, we report an evidence: « 1. I will restrain myself in any impetus of                     perturbation in order to see whether restraining oneself helps the settlement of a                     matter. 2. I will refrain myself by saying, \" Didn't I have to repent for giving free                     play ? For sure, I would have to repent if I give free play now! \" 3. I wills say to                     myself, \" Charity is patient. Patience makes the work perfect. \" 4. I have to edify                     through meekness, because anger and pride scandalize. 5. I will note the defeats I                     suffer: may the good Jesus free me! 6. As to the reproaches, I will say together                     with Saint John Chrysostom, \" It is better to be lacking in severity than in mercy.       29                     \" 7. During the enemy's temptation I will say, \" My enemies will exult if I am                     shaken! \" And I will add the ejaculatory prayer, \" O Jesus, meek and humble of                     heart,... \" 8. When I am at fault, I will do a penance. » At the end he concludes                     with a stanza:                          Refrain! See whether refraining is better.                         As always, you will repent for giving free play.                         Charity is patient: I should rather                         Make up for any scandal, which I did convey.                         If my enemy happens to make me totter,                          He will be very happy of my prey!                         O meek and humble Lord,                          Put my heart on your accord!","6. Specifying the Father's spirit                              The conditions of the Father's spirit are better described in his two following                     reports.                          Exact report upon the defects of my spiritual life which hinder my perfect                     union  with  the  supreme  good:  1.  Strong  and  steadfast  attachment  to  the  little                     comforts  NECESSARY  to  maintain  life,  such  as  food,  clothes,  dwelling,                     satisfaction  of  the  needs  such  as  hunger,  thirst,  sleep,  etc.  (Italics  are  by  the                     Father).  2.  Extreme,  perhaps  sinful,  surely  most  faulty  pusillanimity,  which                     originates in a) execration of suffering and b) extreme fear of death. This fear                     gives rise to: a) a great care of the bodily health and b) a strong attachment to                     life. 3. Indolence, i.e., great spiritual and temporal laziness, and faintness, which                     originates from a) inconstancy in doing good. b) Indifference. c) Transgression                     on many duties. d) Anger, when I am removed from laziness by force. 4. Strong                     attachment to my own will and right opinion, which originates from: a) Anger. b)          30                     Indignation. c) Pique. 5. Anger, which gives rise to frequent lack of meekness                     and grudges (Ibid. page 39).                          We quote the 1896 report:                          Scrutiny of my spirit: « 1. Hostile disposition to suffering: I always seek to                     avoid and try to send it off. 2. Attachment to the comforts of life: not only I seek                     them,  but  I  feel  disturbed  when  I  lack  them.  3.  Gluttony:  I  do  not  become                     detached  from  several  tasty  bits,  I  am  rather  so  attached  to  them  that  people                     notice  it.  I  like  to  find  pleasure  in  food;  in  fact,  I  am  concerned  with  various                     qualities of paste, with variety of cooking, etc. 4. Excessive fear of death, which                     originates  from  immoderate  attachment  to  life.  5.  Some  pride  or  selfishness,                     which causes a great aversion when I have to humble myself or to surrender in                     certain circumstances. 6. Attachment to my opinion. When an idea or opinion or                     event is true in  my judgment, I regret being contradicted and I defend myself                     boldly, taking trouble because the others do not accept my reason. 7. Nuisance                     and indolence to doing good, working, confessing, etc., which sometimes causes                     serious consequences. 8. Plenty","of defects through my tongue... Love for God is too much self-interested! »                     (Ibid. page 41).                          Untiring of searching and researching into his soul, on January 7, 1901, the                     Father draws a new report on the same miseries, which bind him in a daily battle:                          « Know  yourself gluttony, laziness, food, sleep, rest. » That's odd! Did he                     want to do without ? He continues: < Strong attachment to the things necessary                     to  life,  not  to  the  superfluous  ones;  very  sensitive  inclination  to  anger,                     inconstancy,  levity,  selfishness  and  pride,  which  hinder  me  from  humbling                     myself, but give rise to many motions of anger in the oppositions, and lead me to                     behave  imprudently  and  harshly  with  my  neighbor.  Habit  of  simulation,                     falsehood, rashness, great reluctance (I would rather say loathing) for suffering,                     and weakness in the resolves. » Summary: pride, anger, gluttony, and indolence                     are predominant.                          He asks the Lord for five favors:                          «  1.  Strength  in  love.  2.  Patience  without  complaint.  3.  Meekness.  4.                     Temperance. 5. Repression and victory on the first motions of anger. » To attack                     the motions of anger more resolutely, he makes new resolves after meditating on                     the  Passion  of  our  Lord:  «  After  considering  the  opprobriums  our  divine        31                     redeemer Jesus Christ suffered out of love for me, when people wrong or disgust                     me: 1. I will refrain from anger. 2. From resentment. 3. From vengeance. 4. I will                     lay the blame on myself, deciding in favor of others. 5. I will return good for evil                     » (S.C. Vol. 10, page 35).                          The Father would have liked to erase the defects of his past life in order to                     begin a perfectly holy life. During the retreat with the Redemptorist Fathers at                     Pagani in September 1900, he conceived and explained the nature of a religious                     practice aimed at renewing the spiritual life. He called it:                          « Recreating practice for making for the past life »                          What  does  the  word  re-creating  mean?  It  is  worth  for  those  who  after                     entering the way to God, understand the mistakes they have committed in their                     past life, wail for the time they have lost, the grace they have dissipated, etc., and                     wish to have known, loved, and served God since their infancy, or even since                     their conception. Cor mundum etc.                          What kind of practice is this one? Suppose that a man is told that he is going                     to  be  annihilated  in  order  to  be  created  again,  but  endowed  with  a  perfect                     intelligence, a perfect power to do","either Good or evil from the time of his conception. He also will be endowed                     with a 'clear knowledge of God, Jesus Christ, his holy mysteries, and his own last                     end. He also will have the opportunity to redress the wrong he did in his past life,                     to atone for the duties toward God he did not fulfill, and to recover the celestial                     good he would have inherited if he had been faithful in loving and serving God.                          What would this man do in such a case? I do not know what everyone would                     do, but I would do so... (S.C. Vol. 10, page 58).                          Sadly, we ignore what the Father would have done, because he didn't write it.                     Surely  he  told  the  Lord  his  resolves,  but  he  denied  the  inquisitive  eyes  to                     examine the mysteries of his soul. However, we are more fortunate about another                     writing  on  the  same  subject  that  the  Father  wrote  on  July  6,  1901,  on  the                     occasion of his fiftieth birthday, but is unfinished. Its title is:                          Exercise of spiritual rebirth                          Most  high  God,  my  Lord  and  creator,  yesterday,  July  5,  at  9:00  p.m.,  I                     reached the age of fifty.  Alas, what have I  done with these  years? How did I                     spend them for you? My God, what a series of wastes, wickednesses, losses, and                     offenses I have committed in  your eyes! How will I repair  your divine heart?                     How will I repay you? How will I recover what I have lost? Oh, I wish I were              32                     born again in the world in order to love and to serve you from the moment of my                     conception ! Oh, infinite beauty, eternal truth, why didn't I know and love you                     from the very beginning of my existence ?                         Oh, most adorable Jesus, I am just dust and ash. Still I speak to you, who are                     eternal  and  infinite.  My  beloved,  because  past,  present  and  future  times  are                     instantaneous before you, let me do this exercise of love. For instance, if in the                     moment  of  my  conception  in  the  motherly  womb  you  had  infused  in  me  the                     knowledge that I have now; if from the first instant, through your free mercy, I                     had known you as much as I know you now; I would have lived in the following                     way, my beloved Jesus, my life, light of my eyes.                         1. As my head passed from my mother's womb, I would have breathed and                     wailed. Through that  breathing and wailing  I would have performed an act of                     love for you, my God. Then, by means of sighs, cries, and tears I would have                     said what 1 can say now: My God and creator, adorable savior of my soul, I am a                     little creature, an imperceptible atom. I adore you! Newborn, I kneel at your feet,                     kissing them lovingly, and adoring you! I acknowledge and confess that you are                     my God, my Lord, my all. I adore you! Newborn to the world. I adore you with                     my soul,","my body, and my senses! Adorable Jesus, I love the most holy Trinity in you! I                     adore you, God the Father. I adore you, God the Son. I adore you, God the Holy                     Spirit. O most holy Trinity, together with the Sacred Heart of Jesus I adore your                     infinite perfection, your divine attributes, and your most holy operations. O my                     Jesus,  through  you  I  offer  myself,  body,  soul,  senses,  mind,  heart,  spiritual                     powers, will, freedom, and all to the most holy, august Trinity.                          How will I thank you for having creating me ?... (Vol. 4, page 63).                        7. The last resolves                             An  additional  list  of  resolves!  On  July  24,  1906,  after  premising  the                     following quotation: « Show me the way in which *I should walk » (Ps. 143, 8),                     the Father writes,                          I  will  not  approve  with  pure  will  any  taste,  pleasure  or  satisfaction  of                     feelings, or pleasure of the lower spirit, even though such a taste, pleasure, or                     satisfaction is licit. If they are spiritual, I will approve them within bounds. If I     33                     break this resolve, I will renew it mildly and strongly as if it were for the first                     time.                         I will not let my natural instinct alleviate a serious or a light pain, or trouble,                     or annoyance... until I am able to endure it. If enduring it diverts from prayer, or                     religious service... then I will remove it mildly and tranquilly, humiliating myself                     because  of  my  inability  to  endure  the  least  pain  such  as  a  bit  of  hair  or  a                     mosquito landing on my face, etc. If I am unable or it is improper to remove it,                     then I will implore the divine help trying to conform and to endure the thing with                     patience.  Just  in  case,  I  will  pray  to  be  liberated,  always  humiliating  myself,                     because of my inability...                         I will endeavor to deprive my senses of what delights them even licitly in                     eating,  drinking,  etc.,  and  when  I  do  not  succeed  in  doing  so,  I  will  humble                     myself quietly.                          I will ask the divine mercy to enlighten and help me give my senses the basic                     necessities, or what is useful to my spiritual good or the good of others, without                     consenting etc. If I lack effective enlightenment, I will humble myself deeply and                     quietly, acknowledging that such a lack is due to the abuse of my senses, to my                     bad habits which allowed them to grow according to nature instead of grace, and                     to  my  failure  in  prayer  and  self-denial.  Given  all  this,  I  will  humble  myself                     before God entreating","him to give me good will and complete victory over myself through sacrifice,                     strength,  contrition  ...  and  the  merits  of  my  crucified  Lord  and  our  Lady  in                     sorrow!                          In every action and moment, I will endeavor to pay careful attention to these                     resolves and to get used to the divine presence, the meditation upon divine truth,                     the scripture, or the sayings of the saints. By renouncing pleasure and everything                     according to nature, I aim at achieving the happy disposition of the spirit pointed                     out by the apostle: « Those who weep, as though they were not sad; those who                     laugh, as though they were not happy)) (I Cor. 7, 30).                          These resolves are the beginning of the spiritual life that I have not yet begun                     at the age of 55. May divine mercy, that has been tolerating me, call me in the                     last hour. Amen (Vol. 43, page 37).                          Obviously, this is not the beginning of the spiritual life: everyone perceives                     that  these  resolves  characterize  the  Father's  perfection  at  the  age  of  55.  This                     appears more clearly from his notes on September 7, 1907:                          For the divine union: 1. Purification of the soul. 2. Prayer. 3. Detachment. 4.                     Mortification  of  the  senses.  5.  Disposition  to  suffer  a  thousand  pains  and                     persecutions for Jesus Christ. 6. Continuous meditation on the Passion of Jesus           34                     Christ. 7. Meditation on his most holy life and divine words, imitating his virtues                     and works, and loving him fervently. 8. To abstract oneself from occupations and                     to concentrate on God in very quiet silence with such a perfect submission (at                     least in the will and intention) as to resemble a dead person in everything, only                     wanting God's will in everything. 9. Being in this state, to love God and everyone                     in  him,  only  seeking  his  honor  and  his  consolation.  10.  To  treat  friends  and                     enemies with great meekness, humility, kindness, and holy love (Vol. 43, page                     44).                          In the last 20 years of the Father's writings we do not find examinations of                     conscience and reforms of life, nor prayers for the conversion or rebirth. Is it a                     sign  of  tiredness  or  slackness?  Not  at  all!  On  the  contrary,  the  longing  for                     holiness was always alive and ardent in him, and the impetus toward perfection                     was always more compelling. But the constant work of so many years on his soul                     had already matured its fruits. The habit of virtue had become second nature in                     him. His spirit had become more simple; and a rapid, interior look at the copious,                     divine light,","which was pouring into his soul because of his habitual union with God, was                     enough to purify and to regenerate his soul in the fervor of charity.                       Notes                             (1) The Father quotes the old translation by Martini, in common use in those times.                     The new official translation of the Bible is derived directly from the Hebrew, not from                     the Vulgate, and has a different meaning.                          (2)The following prayer for holy mortification is noteworthy:                         My  sweetest  savior  Jesus,  you  told  us  that  your  kingdom  has  been  subjected  to                     violence and the violent are taking it. Kneeling at your feet I beseech you to give me the                     grace to mortify myself in order to take your kingdom.                         I sigh, long for it with all the strength of my spirit. I stare at it, stretch out my hands                     ...But I do not know how to reach it, how to gain it, how to take it, because I do not                     know how to mortify myself in order to overcome my bad inclinations, to embrace the                     suffering, to destroy my passions, to generously overcome my reluctance and hellish                     suggestions.                         My virtue abandoned me! I have become like a man dreaming of running, and yet,                     he does not move. I am lying down on the ground, please lift me up. O Jesus, touch me     35                     with your powerful hand and lift me up. My merciful Jesus, for the sake of your pure                     charity, instill  in my soul  the powerful,  triumphant  grace, which leads us  where  you                     want with strength and gentleness without destroying our free will.                         For the sake of your divine strength, through which you won the human reluctance,                     tedium,  and  sadness,  I  beg  you  to  fortify  my  most  feeble  nature  so  that  I  may  win                     myself,  embrace  any  suffering  with  love  and  patience,  and  repress  even  the  first                     motions  of  selfishness  and  passions.  May  I  overcome  my  reluctance  and  the  devil's                     temptations; mortify my senses;  detach my heart  from  any  created thing;  oppose my                     will  radically,  and  renounce  my  opinion.  Let  me  practice  the  Christian  virtues                     continuously; work for your glory and for the salvation of souls; destroy the bad habits,                     of my spirit; humiliate my pride both before you, who are my God, and the creatures                     that are your images. Above all, may I humble myself before the people from whom my                     pride flees not to humiliate itself!...                         O my omnipotent Jesus,  give me  your most holy  helping hand to  get  rid of this                     lukewarmness, inconstancy, laziness, and extreme weakness! My Jesus, render me apt                     to  take  your kingdom!  You said  that the path  leading to  life is  narrow, and its door                     straight.  See  to  it  that  I  walk  through  this  narrow  path,  subside,  and  strive  to  enter                     through the straight door.                         My God, create a pure heart, and renew an upright spirit in me! Give me a new                     mind and a new will to know you, to act against my nasty nature","vigorously and generously, to seek the good, and to mortify myself in order to take                     your kingdom. You said,’ Whoever wishes to be my follower must deny his very self,                     take up his cross every day, and follow in my steps.' Please grant me the effective grace                     to entirely renounce myself, to carry my cross, to embrace suffering with love, and to                     follow in your footsteps by imitating your divine virtues. My omnipotent Jesus, I am                     unworthy  of  this  grace;  I  am  rather  worthy  of  your  indignation,  and  even  of  your                     rejection! But, for the sake of your sorrows, for the sake of your most holy mother, for                     the ransom  you paid for my soul, I beg  you, my dear  Jesus: come to  my assistance,                     because I am perishing. O my loving Jesus, make haste, make haste. Enliven me in your                     way and mercy. I believe, but I rely on you to help my feeble faith ! I want to belong                     totally to you according to your will in order to please you only, to become a victim of                     your  divine  will  and  love.  My  Jesus,  hear  me.  Infuse  in  me  the  effective  grace  of                     mortifying myself in any circumstance so that I may take your kingdom. \" Thy kingdom                     come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. \" Work with your omnipotent hand                     this miracle of infinite mercy so  that  I may  win my  reluctance, the temptations,  and                     everything  which  hinders  me  from  obtaining  perfect  union  with  you,  who  are  the                     supreme  good.  I  long  and  sigh  ardently,  uniquely,  and  continuously  for  having  you.                     Amen. Amen. (Vol. 6, page 133).                           (3)      Obviously, the Father is referring to the « Exercise for the new life » he                     had written for everyone: I. On the established day everyone goes to confession. 2. That                     day is supposed to be the day of rebirth. 3. The following day they renew the baptismal                     vows, choosing a patron saint, making protestations of faithfulness, and promising new                     life, etc. 4. They redeem the past life by doing practices of piety for as many months    36                     there are years to be redeemed. 5. They apply to each month the merits of one year of                     Jesus  Christ.  6.  After  renewing  the  baptismal  vows,  they  start  the  spiritual  infancy,                     which lasts seven months. 7. They begin the first year of infancy with the practices of                     piety lasting one month. The second  year of infancy they  exercise other practices  of                     piety lasting another month, and so forth. 8. When a month corresponds to a more sinful                     year, the people increase the practice of piety for expiation. 9. To shorten the practice of                     the  new  life,  one  can  consider  a  day  as  one  year.  10.  The  daily  mass,  prayers,                     mortifications, the reception of the sacraments, the practices of piety, etc., are the chief                     points to atone for the past life and to regenerate the spiritual life. 11. Special prayers                     and practices of piety are made at the passing from one age to another, such as infancy                     to puberty, puberty to youth, youth to manhood, etc. 12. The application of the years of                     Jesus Christ to the person who practices this devotion may be varied according to the                     age of the person. 13. « Before starting this practice, one can premise nine days both to                     remember the nine months our Lord Jesus Christ was carried in the womb, and to keep                     him company. To prepare oneself for the confession of the past life, one could spend                     these days in spiritual retreat. When people practice this devotion by days instead of                     months, they may premise nine hours instead of nine days. During the nine days the                     faithful recite the Miserere psalm, every day » (July 29, 1889 - Vol. 40, page 121).","2.                                                                                                 “FAITH                                                                                          SEEING                                                                                    THROUGH                                                                                    ANY VEIL”                            1.

Beginning and Foundation                                The council of Trent teaches that faith is the beginning, the foundation,                     and the root of justification (Densinger Ranher, Enchiridion Symbolorum, 801).                     The Vatican Council tells us that faith is our free answer to the revelation of God                     (Dei Verbum, 5). Consequently, the study of a Servant of God's life begins with                     his faith.                             What was the Father's faith?                             If we listen to him, we will be disappointed. Father Vitale reports: “He                     once told me: our Lord said, \" If you have as much faith as a seed of mustard,                     you will be able to tell a mountain to move and it will obey \" (Mt. 17,20). Then                     the padre added,”It means that our faith is less than a seed of mustard: oh, if we                     had faith “! “(Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 297). In his last will, he                     wrote of himself: “He was feeble in faith “(S.C. Vol. 7, page 242). We know,                     however, know that bearing witness to oneself is suspicious, especially in this           38                     case,  because  the  people  who  knew  the  Father  judged  him  objectively  and                     differently.                             Those who knew the Father, repute him as a man of a living, supernatural                     faith. Preaching to the faithful, to make them understand the nature of faith, he                     explains very plainly:                      Through faith we believe in God and in what he has revealed. The merit of faith                     consists in our believing in the religious truths without having seen them. In fact,                     we never saw God. We never saw Jesus Christ. We do not see the work of grace                     in the sacraments. For instance, in the Eucharist we only see the species of bread                     and wine. And yet, we are sure that God exists, that Jesus Christ came into this                     world, that grace works through the sacraments, and that Jesus is present under                     the species of bread and wine.                             The merit of faith is due to our believing in what we do not see. Those                     who believe in what they have seen, have no merit, because believing in what we                     perceive with our senses requires no sacrifices, nor labor. On the contrary, the                      merit is ascribed to the one who says: “I","believe because God wants me to believe, even though I have seen nothing of                     what I believe. Furthermore, I believe in it more firmly than if I had seen it with                     my eyes! “However, our eyes can deceive us; faith does not! How many times                     we are mistaken because of our bodily eyes!                             Isn't it true that a far off square tower is seen as a round one? That an oar                     in the water seems to be broken, but it is not? The result of our vision sometimes                     does not correspond to reality, whereas, what we believe is always true because                     faith never deceives... Besides, a person pays his respect to his Creator by relying                     on his divine word (Vol. 10, pages 30-31).                             The Father's faith was so alive that it seemed to turn into a vision. When                     he talked of the eternal truths, they seemed as unveiled to him, as if he could                     touch them. In his ingenuity, he said that despite his sins, God endowed him with                     the spirit of faith, and he was so aware of his divine presence as to cry out in                     consolation while thinking of God's greatness and kindness. One day, seeing two                     probationers absent-minded in prayer, he reproached them with these words: “It                     is obvious that you do not believe in the presence of God. “Father Vitale writes:                     “Sometimes  the  Father  told  me,  “I  do  not  know  what  temptation  against  faith                     means.”As a  matter of fact, he did not know it, because he was carrying God                     within himself, living for him, and hoping in him”(Bulletin, 1928, page 51).                                                                                                               39                            Untiring of thanking God for the gift of faith, on every anniversary of his                     baptism he went to Saint Mary of Providence church, where he was baptized, to                     thank  the  Lord.  He  did  so  until  1908,  when  the  church  was  destroyed  by  the                     earthquake. When he celebrated with the community, before the penitential rite                     he used to invite the faithful to thank the Lord for the grace of holy baptism.                             While preaching at the end of the year, he recounted both the general and                     the particular benefits the Lord had granted, first of all the baptism, for which                     everyone should thank the Lord untiringly.                             On March 25, 1922, he mailed a circular to the houses, recommending the                     Holy Childhood, and saying,                             Many children in the savages and infidels' lands perish in the streets, or at                     the foot of the trees,  or are drowned  in the rivers by  their cruel  parents; their                     souls fall into Limbo instead of going to heaven, never seeing God, which make                     us cry with emotion!                             He points to our fortune for having been born in Christian countries by                     God's mercy.","Was  our  adorable  God  bound  to  create  us  in  conditions  so  different  from                     those of the children who are born of savage parents in corrupted regions? We                     are born instead in the holy Church's womb; we are baptized, instructed in the                     holy religion, guided to the holy altars; we are called to the religious life, to the                     divine  service;  we  are  supported  by  so  many  celestial  means  for  our                     sanctification! And yet, we have to love all souls as much as ours, concerning                     ourselves with them as with ours. God wants it!                          Recommending  the  Holy  Childhood  along  with  the  readings  of  its  printed                     matter, he excites in the youth faith and charity:                          I  am  not  urging  you  to  contribute  to  this  holy  work  through  alms;  if  you                     could,  you  would  with  great  pleasure;  I  am  more  concerned  with  fostering                     charity and zeal for winning souls to Jesus, because if you were apathetic, you                     were not Rogationists of Jesus' Heart, nor Daughters of Divine Zeal! (S.C. Vol.                     5, page 57).                        2. I am faithful to my uniform                                                                                                                40                               The faithful must profess before  men the faith they have received  from                     God  through  the  Church...  Hence  they  are,  as  true  witnesses  of  Christ,  more                     strictly  obliged  to  spread  the  faith  by  word  and  deed  “(Lumen  gentium,  11,                     17-35).                          Let us see how the Father complied with these duties.                          The several volumes of prayer he wrote to the Lord, the Madonna, the angels,                     and the saints are a profession of faith. Profession of faith refers mainly to the                     two  religious  orders  that  sprang  from  him,  as  well  as  all  the  works  he  did,                     because  his  firm  faith  in  God  emerges  from  them.  While  we  were  in  stormy                     events, he used to say: “In such circumstances, the only thing we can do is pray.                     “Specifically, I like quoting the letter he wrote on August 12, 1902. By partisan                     spirit, the city council denied the Father help on the feasts of the Assumption,                     and he wrote the","following trenchant letter to the Mayor, Anthony Martino:                         ...You  are  already  convinced  that  the  councilmen  quarrel  with  my  ideals,                     aspiring  to  make  me  compromise  my  principles  and  buy  their  own  for  three                     thousand  liras!  But  in  case  they  do  not  understand,  if  they  are  rationalists,  or                     atheists,  or  enemies  of  priests,  I  am  a  Catholic,  an  apostolic,  a  Roman  priest,                     faithful to my uniform. I am proud of the principles of religion that support me in                     the tremendous fight to save so many unhappy creatures who would otherwise be                     either  in  jail  or  in  houses  of  prostitution,  despite  the  polemic  from  my                     adversaries! (S.C. Vol. 1, page 81).                        3. The catechist                         Now we dwell a little upon his catechetical apostolate.                     From his tender age, the Father longed to teach catechism. On Feb. 5, 1878, on                     the occasion of the first catechetical awards in Saint Philip Neri's church, he was                     the speaker. He revealed his thoughts on the teaching of Christian doctrine, on its                     importance  and  sublimity,  on  the  individual  and  social  advantages  of  this       41                     teaching,  in  which  great  men  engaged  themselves,  such  as  Gersone,  Bossuet,                     Fenelon; as well as great saints, such as Jerome, Augustine, and Alphonsus M.                     Liguori, all of whom preached the miracle of understanding and holiness. The                     latter  “wrote  a  booklet  of  catechism  for  children  during  the  missions,  and  he                     himself, sometimes taught it in the churches of his diocese. “The Father points                     out that teaching catechism is a noble ministry by itself and because of charity,                     which makes such a teaching possible. “So much self-denial is the daughter of                     charity:  it  is  through  charity  that  the  Christian  loves  his  neighbor  as  himself,                     willing  to  bestow  the  treasure  of  his  faith  on  others,  to  suffer  and  to  bear                     everything, feeling himself rewarded when he succeeds in making a poor child                     know that there is one God who created everything “(Vol. 45, page 419).                          In  1882,  Archbishop  Guarino  asked  the  Father  to  see  how  the  project  of                     teaching catechism was implemented or conducted in the city. The Father wrote                     a report, submitting a plan of his own to implement the method already in force,                     and to help children. In conclusion, the Father said:","The plan I have submitted is somehow general. Therefore, it requires work                     and a teaching staff to carry it out. Nevertheless, always trusting in God, author                     of  any  good,  and  in  the  most  holy  Virgin  of  the  Sacred  Letter,  under  whose                     patronage  is  the  Teaching  of  the  Christian  Doctrine,  we  can  achieve                     improvements,  step  by  step.  The  benefits  we  can  reap  from  a  well-guided                     teaching program are great. They include the salvation of many souls. We have                     to pray and work (S.C. Vol. 7, page 262).                          The Father was a theorist and a practitioner of teaching catechism, which he                     did throughout his life with all his love. Besides, his institutions sprang from his                     teaching  catechism  to  the  children  and  the  poor  of  Avignone  quarter,  whose                     minds he enlightened with the light of faith. At the beginning of such ministry he                     wrote the booklet, Little summary of catechism for children (S.C. Vol. 7, pages                     244-253).                          After so many years, I remember seeing him affable and smiling in the midst                     of our children or the poor, teaching catechism in his last times with so much                     love.                          He began redeeming the Avignone quarter by teaching catechism, which he                     warmly recommended to the sisters. He chose religion as the foundation of his             42                     educational system. Therefore, he requires to start the orphans' education with                     catechism, recommending the Rogationists and the Daughters of Divine Zeal to                     learn the best and the more effective methods of teaching it.                          Brother Louis M. Barbanti, an assistant to the orphans for so many years in                     Messina,  recalls  that  the  Father  supervised  the  teaching  of  catechism  and  the                     orphans' improvement every week by questioning and instructing them. At the                     end of each visit, he concluded the supervision by relating some edifying story                     and by awarding the most diligent of the orphans.                          A former orphan, Rose De Blasi, gives a piece of news about the Father's                     family.  She  says,  “While  teaching  catechism  to  the  children,  he  explained  the                     effects of baptism and its necessity, because the children who die without having                     this  sacrament  go  to  Limbo.  And  he  adds,  “I,  too,  have  a  little  brother  in                     Limbo!”Then, he lifted up his eyes as though he were supplicating the Lord to                     take the little brother to heaven! “In his writings to the communities, the Father                     insists on the teaching of Christian doctrine:                           The orphans must be instructed in Christian doctrine from their","tender age. The sisters will avoid teaching the elements of faith mechanically...                     Because teaching the doctrine to children mechanically is almost nothing “(Vol.                     1, pages 252-253). “The sisters will fulfill the aims of the foundation by teaching                     Christian doctrine to the young girls with zeal and holy fervor. They will teach                     catechism diligently, in support and in compliance with the parish program by                     giving appropriate explanations and lessons of history “(R. A. page 436). To the                     Rogationists: “They will apply themselves to the teaching of Christian doctrine                     with love and zeal, following the best  methods in order that their teaching be                     complete and fruitful. They will foster the catechetical contests, will award child-                     ren, and will use various  means  to win the  love of them. They  will apply the                     same  strategies  to  the  celebration  of  first  and  frequent  Communions  “(Vol.  3,                     page 28).                          Any means is good to infuse “in the tender heart of the children the fear of                     God, the dread of sin, love for our Lord Jesus Christ, the most holy Virgin, Saint                     Joseph, the angels, the saints, the holy Church, and the Pope, as well as charity                     for our neighbor, mercy on the poor, and fondness of virtues. “                         4. Longing to spread the faith                                                            43                        What  can  we  say  of  the  Father's  longing  for  spreading  the  faith?  He  ardently                     desired it from his tender age. His zealous teaching of the catechism, the aim of                     his two orders, the spreading of the  Rogate,  the assistance to the unprivileged                     classes and to the poor show how the Father's heart was burning with spreading                     the faith.                          Later we will touch upon his preaching from the time he was a cleric; but he                     also thought of the real missions to the infidels' lands in the hope that numerous                     missionaries would rise from among his communities.                          Writing to the mother superior of the Sacred Side about the training of the                     missionaries, he said,                          It is necessary to form their spirit of obedience and sacrifice in order to avoid                     what  happened  to  the  volunteers  of  the  past  war.  They  enrolled  themselves                     enthusiastically; but, in the trenches, in the terrible risks of","the war, and in the hard labors they exclaimed' \" I wish I never enrolled myself! \"                     The sacrifices in the missions are numerous. Therefore, cultivate the wish of the                     sisters, but first get them used to sacrifice themselves in the office to which they                     are appointed (Vol. 38, page 91).                          The sisters still remember the evening missions in the house of Trani, where                     the Father explained to the communities the importance of helping the foreign                     missions by prayer and other means. Waiting for when the Lord would open the                     missionary  field  to  his  institute,  he  established  some  rules  for  the  missionary                     house  in  order  to  train  the  sisters  appointed  to  this  most  holy  end.  He  wrote,                     “Only  the  mission  enthusiasts  who  are  firmly  resolved  to  face  travels,                     inconveniences, want, and perils; who feel the divine impulse to bear witness of                     their  love  toward  Jesus  through  martyrdom  will  be  appointed  to  such  an                     apostolate”(Vol. 1, page 187).                          To foster such a wish in the communities, while teaching he insisted on the                     witness of love to God. “In his exhortations, he often asked us, “Would you die                     for the faith in time of persecutions?”Readiest to give up his life for Jesus Christ,                     he  took  pleasure  when  we  declared  ourselves  ready  to  follow  him,  especially                     when  he  was  exhorting  us  to  be  firm  in  the  coming  persecutions  against  the                     Church. “                                                                                 44                          “One  sister  relates,  he  wished  the  faith  to  spread,  especially  through  the                     missions.  One  day  he  asked  us,  “Who  wishes  to  go  to  China?”I  answered                     immediately, Me! “But you must pay the fare!”, he said. Surely not, I answered.                     You are the Father. Therefore, you must take care of it. And he concluded, “You                     will pay by saying one Hail Mary \". “                              Was the Father inclined to martyrdom?                          We read in his will: “Envious of the martyr's fortune, he was far from making                     a martyr of himself, even though he trusted in God; and in case of martyrdom, he                     would be given strength and courage “(S.C. Vol. 7, page 241).                          Sometimes, however, he betrayed himself by declaring that he was ready to                     face death for God. We often heard him saying that he was ready to die for our                     Lord. “Oh, if I had the grace to be a missionary!”He also said he was ready to                     face death as many times as there were persons to be converted; but he used to                     add, “God considers me unworthy of martyrdom!... “He was","also envious of the missionaries' fortune, and used to say that if he died and the                     order  stopped  existing  for  any  reason,  his  property  should  be  given  to  the                     missions. In the will of 1918, he appointed Propaganda Fide (the Congregation                     for the Evangelization of People) as heir of his goods (S.C. Vol. 7, page 237).                          I report this touching episode: “Many times he talked to us about the bliss of                     giving  up  life  for  Jesus  Christ,  and,  usually,  he  concluded  by  narrating  the                     martyrdom of Saint Ignatius, to whom he was very devout. He commissioned an                     artist to paint the saint among two lions and published a booklet of prayers along                     with songs in his honor. In November of 1917 (during the war), when he was                     leaving from Oria to Sicily, he came to say goodbye and to bless us. Suddenly,                     he said, “My children, I am leaving, but none knows what may happen to us by                     the  Lord's  will.  How  happy  I  would  be  if  while  passing  through  the  Messina                     strait the Turks would take me prisoner, bind me with chains, and command me                     to deny Christ, threatening me with the sword at the throat! No! No! Would I cry,                     long live Jesus! Then, my head would fall down by  the sword, and my blood                     would glorify the holy faith. What a fortune! “Then he asked each of us whether                     we wished for martyrdom. Happy and radiant with delight for our readiness, he                     suggested the reading of the book by Saint Alphonsus, Victories of the Martyrs.                                                                                                                  45                     5. The faith he lived                          How did the Father live his faith?                     The life of faith, says Pius XII, requires that the faithful “accept submissively                     and  in  full  the  divine  teaching,  applying  it  to  their  lives  so  that  the  faith  be                     always the light of their behavior, and their behavior be the reflection of their                     faith “(Menti nostrae, no. 14).                          Witnesses  assert  that  the  Father  lived  his  faith  in  the  practice  of  Christian                     virtues,  especially  charity,  and  that  his  life  along  with  his  activity  was  the                     manifestation of his faith.                              The Father describes the life of faith,                          The man who lives according to his faith rises above all earthly things with                     the spirit, and takes advantage of his senses to soar to God.","He sees the fertile country covered with  various grass, flowers, and fruits. He                     watches the foaming seas stretching out as far as the horizon. He contemplates                     the sky flooded by the flashing light of the sun or decorated with innumerable                     stars; and in the midst of the beauty and wonders he lifts up his eyes to the sky to                     bless God, who created marvelous things. When he hears the sweet sounds of                     music  or  the  warbling  of  the  early-riser  birds;  when  he  takes  delight  in  the                     tasteful food, or smells the gentle fragrance of roses and jasmines, he praises and                     admires the Creator's omnipotent kindness.                          Whoever lives on faith esteems the earthly  things as nothing. He  loves no                     riches, because faith teaches him that the grace of God is the precious pearl to be                     gained at any cost; and that it is better to heap up riches which thieves cannot                     steal, nor rust waste. He seeks no honor, because it is better to be humble in the                     house of God than to dwell in the sinners' abode. He is not greedy, but is frugal                     even in the use of licit pleasures, because he has already got rid of the illicit ones.                     His spirit guides the body, his reason masters the passions, and he lives a pure,                     simple, spiritual life: the life of faith (Vol. 45, page 312).                         Unwillingly  and  unaware,  the  Father  describes  himself  in  the  above                     word-picture.                                                                                                               46                         He liked so much the litany of the soul living on faith, which begins, “My                     Jesus,  free  me  from  the  wish  of  being  esteemed,  “and  he  ordered  the                     communities to say it every day in March, to help the spiritual life.                              Father Vitale writes,                         In familiar colloquies, he admitted that he felt himself in God's presence from                     childhood. He said, “The Lord has granted me no supernatural gifts, except spirit                     of faith and the awareness of his divine presence. Since I was a child when I was                     with  the  Cistercian  Fathers,  He  visited  me  with  gentle  emotions-interior  joy.                     When He excited me to love him, I knew that it was God's will to stay in his                     presence “(Father  Mary Hannibal Di Francia  - his life and works,  page 275).                     Awareness of being in the presence of God became quickly a habit of his spirit.                          The persons who approached him were quickly impressed. Just by looking at                     him, they had a glimpse of the man whose mind was so absorbed in God that                     even his features disclosed it. His speeches and conversations exuded his habitual                     union with the Lord.                               In an article of our Bulletin, Father Vitale reports his first","encounter with the Father,                          About  the  year  1883  I  was  a  young  student,  and  was  talking  with  a  very                     pious,  fervent  friend  of  mine  on  the  threshold  of  a  shop.  We  were  discussing                     spiritual topics. Doubtful whether to leave the world or not, whether to aim at a                     worldly  occupation  or  at  consecrating  myself  to  the  Lord,  I  do  not  remember                     exactly the subject of my chat with that friend who took the cassock before I did.                     Suddenly, a young, tall, slender priest with a seraphic face passed nearby with                     long, slow steps, as if measuring the street. More than putting his feet on the soil                     he seemed skimming it in order to take off.                          I can hardly express what I felt at the sight of that ascetic, but I am sure of                     one  thing:  I  heard  like  a  voice  within  my  heart,  saying,  “You  need  to  detach                     yourself  from  earth  “;  and  I  was  somehow  afraid,  because  I  am  attached  to                     earthly  things.  My  friend  knew  that  priest,  and  greeted  him  reverently.  To  be                     polite, I, too, took off my hat. Then, I asked, “Who is that priest? “With grave,                     respectful voice he told me, “He is Canon Di Francia, a man of God, a priest of                     great virtue. “I loved him ever since (Bulletin, 1928, page 17).                          In the biography, Father Vitale recounts the Father's interior life: “Walking                     and talking with him, people occasionally noticed what he would do when he had                     grounds for praising God and for instilling holy principles in people's hearts. At        47                     little tidings, he would say, “How good the Lord is!”At the roaring thunder, “It is                     God's voice!\" Before the sea rolling out to the horizon, he exclaimed, “Let us                     remember that God is infinite “! “(Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 278).                          Father  Fazio,  S.  J.,  bears  a  wonderful  evidence:  “On  the  whole  I  feel  that                     Canon Di Francia was a man of supernatural principles. He was a man of God                     imbued and saturated with piety and devotion as always to act in a supernatural                     way...  I  think  he  was  a  saint  endowed  with  a  simple,  interior  life.  It  was  his                     second  nature,  which  always  appeared  in  the  charity  toward  the  unhappy.                     “Because of his supernatural spirit he continuously exhorted his children to live                     in the divine presence. On the feasts, his gift was exhorting us to keep the holy                     fear of God. On his saint's name, birthday, Christmas, Easter... when we were                     around him giving our best wishes, he showed his gratitude and reciprocated our                     wishes by saying, “May you have the holy fear of God, the fear of offending him,                     the fear of meeting him as an inexorable judge. “He often quoted Saint Paul, “It                     is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God!”(Heb. 10, 31). Then,                     he reminded us that the hour of death is unknown. Following Saint Philip, he                     unmasked the dreams of youth by asking, “And after","that? And after that? “But, he did not infuse sadness or horror, because even his                     firm word was always accompanied by a gentle smile, sometimes by a joke, and                     by the explanation of the reasons leading us to trust in the Lord's kindness.                        6. Love of the Holy Scripture                              The Father nourished his faith with spiritual reading, and recommended it as                     a  great  means  of  sanctification,  saying  that,  “Well  done,  it  is  like  a  gentle,                     beneficial rain penetrating the soil of the heart, giving pleasure, and helping the                     soul  “(Vol.  1,  page  90).  He  suggested  the  books  written  by  the  saints  and                     Rodriguez, never getting tired of the books by Saint Francis of Sales and Saint                     Alphonsus.                          Above all, he  drew nourishment from the  Scripture, the purest fountain of                     God's word, which he handled from the time of his earliest youth. He was sorry                     because the affairs along with the works of charity hindered him from dedicating                     himself to such a study in order to deepen his understanding. More than once we           48                     heard him saying that he was eager for the study of the Holy Scripture, but he                     concluded  with  this  submissive  grief,  “The  poor  children  overwhelmed                     me!”Knowing by heart many passages from Scripture, he quoted them as the rule                     of his behavior in various circumstances. (1)                          Father Vitale writes, “From the time he was a boy, the Father delighted in the                     reading of Holy Scripture having asked the Lord for a deep understanding of his                     commandments.  He  knew  by  heart  many  sentences  from  Scripture,  and  he                     quoted them in various circumstances, drawing enlightenment from them to do                     good”(Bulletin, 1928, page 50). Father Santoro remembers that one day he made                     a remark, and the Father quoted many biblical sentences about the topic of his                     remark.  Our  students  of  Oria,  at  the  beginning  of  the  theological  study,  were                     exhorted  to  study  and  meditate  upon  the  Holy  Scripture,  the  chief fountain  of                     theology.","On  the  Silver  anniversary  of  the  Pious  Institution,  the  Father  wrote  an                     Epithalamium of the Celestial Love of God in the Sacrament with his Elects, a                     sacred play which wonderfully applied the Song of Songs to the pious institution.                          While visiting the houses of the institute, he often gathered the sisters to read                     the Holy Scripture, especially in the winter evenings. From the Old Testament,                     he liked best the patriarchs' lives. From the New Testament, the Gospel. Usually,                     he commented upon them properly.                          I remember the first time I listened to him speaking of the Bible.                          I had been in Oria a few days. It was a hot afternoon in August when the                     Father went to the grove to meet us. We rushed around him with an inquiring eye                     at the big book he was carrying under his arm. “Do you want to know this book?                     “He asked kindly. “It is the Sacred Scripture, the word of God... “We sat down                     on the ground, beneath the shadow of the pine trees. Resting upon the rock, he                     read  and  commented  on  a  passage  from  the  prophet  Jeremiah.  The  following                     sentence remained fixed in my mind, “It is good for a man to bear the yoke from                     youth onwards “(Lam. 3, 27). He stretched out his hand, seized a piece of wood,                     and put it on his neck to mimic the oxen's yoke.                          Father Drago recalls that when he was a youth, while reading the Bible he             49                     met  the  Father,  who  asked  him  what  he  had  read  and  understood.  The  Father                     listened  to  him,  expressed  his  satisfaction,  and  promised  to  give  him  a  better                     edition. He kept his word by giving him an illustrated Bible in hard cover. Some                     time later, the Father asked him where he had arrived in the reading of the Bible.                     To  his  amazement,  he  was  told  that  Father  Vitale  had  taken  away  the  book.                     Handling the subject with Father Vitale, who upheld the principle that the youth                     at his age would have understood nothing, the Father closed the little dispute by                     saying that the Holy Scripture is bread for everyone. The book was given back to                     the reader.                          The  Father  demanded  greatest  respect  for  the  Bible,  and  he  never  let  the                     people quote its inspired words for profane use, nor for inappropriate meaning,                     nor by levity. When someone of us ventured to quote a biblical sentence by joke                     in his presence, the Father called him to order by saying that the Holy Scripture                      must be used seriously and devoutly.","7. His preaching                              Reading the Father's preaching, we realize that he is breathing deeply the air                     of his faith from the Scripture. Still a youth, the Father manifested his ideas about                     preaching in an article on The Catholic Word (January 2, 1978).                          It is our hope that many are the persons convinced about the real value of the                     gospel preachers. Please reject the vain boasting of the entangled scholasticism                     and of the nebulous philosophy. When a parable of the gospel is explained well,                     it is worthier than all redundant declamations. The Christian morals are so rich                     that you can always draw from them successfully with a little work.                          After  touching  upon  the  great  preachers  of  the  Christian  eloquence,  he                     concludes,                          Please  accustom  yourselves  to  these  models.  Draw  sound  theological                     doctrine from the Bible, the Fathers, and the Gospel. Plan the contents of your                     preaching, beautify and make them pleasant. Cope with the ministry of the divine          50                     word with pure intention, contrition of heart, order, clarity, opportunity, sobriety                     of decoration, and you will improve souls! We must keep in mind that we must                     preach Jesus Christ crucified, not ourselves! (S.C. Vol. 1, page 22).                          The Father preached this way. He gave himself to this mission from his very                     youth,  preaching  in  the  churches  of  the  city  and  of  the  villages  with  warm,                     vibrant, charming voice. Even though not very strong, his voice was piercing,                     almost  cutting,  and  penetrating  to  the  hearers  like  a  blade.  His  measured  and                     expressive gestures along with the fire of his heart made the people remember his                     preaching. Besides his sacred speeches, we have many of his funeral orations,                     some of which marked an epoch in Messing, such as those on Canon Ardoino,                      Ludwig Windhorst, Cardinal Guarino, and Pope Leo XIII. He believed","strongly in the word of God, and spread it generously in his communities. As                     long as he was able to celebrate mass for the communities, he announced every                     day the intentions of the mass and remembered the mystery or the saint of the                     day along with his virtues and works. On holidays, he had the colloquy before                     Communion; after Communion, the homily. To spread the seed of God's word he                     made use of novenas, triduos, retreats, monthly devotions, etc:                             Out of respect for this word, he never spoke extempore to any audience,                     except  in.  unforeseen  cases;  and  yet,  he  was  a  fluent,  trained  speaker.  Many                     outlines of his preaching pertain to just a few children or very  modest sisters.                     One of his resolves was:                             “Before preaching, I will prepare my sermon and will pray to the Most                     High to give success to the divine word. I will also make a special invocation to                     the most holy Virgin of Good Counsel and to my guardian angel. “Zealous for                     being very clear, he wrote: “Even though I may sometimes use a higher style due                     to  the  supernatural  themes  I  treat,  nonetheless  I  must  be  very  clear  so  that                     everyone, even children, uncouth and ignorant people may understand the spirit                     of my preaching even when they cannot understand some words “(Vol. 44, page                     133).                             In 1887, he presents a petition to the Lord, asking for 69 favors. At the          51                     number 17 he implores “the gift of proclaiming the divine word worthily for the                     edification of souls “(Vol. 4, page 14). In the midst of his writings we find two                     prayers for the preachers. One of the prayers has been drawn out of the Acts of                     the  Apostles  (4,  4-30),  where  the  faithful  implore  from  the  Lord  the  grace  to                     proclaim his word with certainty. The other one is conceived by the Father. We                     quote some passages,                             Please give me the grace to cope with the ministry of the word, which has                     been entrusted to me, an ignorant weak man... Because I need enlightenment, I                     shiver for my inability when I have to teach the faithful. However, I undertake                     this  sublime  apostolate  for  the  sake  of  your  name  and  by  virtue  of  holy                     obedience... May your grace strengthen me so that the divine word be free from                     my  selfishness,  human  respects,  my  foolishness,  and  I  proclaim  you,  the                     crucified,  not  me...  Give  me  the  apostolic  word,  which  overthrows  the  people                     without  vilifying  them,  triumphs  without  making  violence,  kills  sin,  but  saves                     sinners. O Lord, give me the holy science, the understanding of the Scripture,                     which surpasses worldly study. See to it that I proclaim the divine word to your                     people in such a way that while children feed on it, the great receive at their fill;                     and while I speak to the learned persons, the ignorant too understand... Vol. 6,                     page 36).","To  conclude  this  topic,  we  quote  another  prayer  for  the  ecclesiastical                     science:                            Give  me  the  celestial  wisdom,  the  science  of  the  saints  and  of  the                     ecclesiastical discipline... Grant me enlightenment, graces, and opportunities to                     achieve  the  knowledge  necessary  to  my  priestly  ministry  so  that  I  worthily                     administer  the  holy  sacraments  and  the  divine  word  without  prejudice  to  the                     interests of your divine Heart and to souls. Jesus Repairer, repair my past life.                     For  the  sake  of  your  pure  charity,  grant  me  good  will,  understanding,  and                     opportunity to achieve what I am asking of you, what I need, and above all, what                     you want. Amen (Vol. 6, page 142).                             How did the Father judge his own preaching? We quote from the funeral                     oration he made for himself. “His preaching had its ups and downs. Sometimes it                     was  vibrant  and  touching.  Other  times  it  was  trivial!  He  himself  said  that  the                     results of his preaching were two: some yawned and others cried “(S.C. 6, page                     241).                            We know that his witness here is suspect, because no one can judge for                     himself.                            The Father's preaching was always sacred not only because of the subject,                     but also because of the way he treated it. He always proved his assertion with                     Holy  Scripture,  Holy  Fathers,  and  the  examples  of  the  saints  or  events  of     52                     ecclesiastical history.                            Children were very impressed by his living, penetrating, but very simple                     reasoning, fit for their mental capacity, especially when he treated the figures, the                     symbols, and the prophesies about the Messiah and the most holy Virgin Mary.                            As we have seen, he was very intent on being clear to the adults and to                     children. The audience loved his preaching for the simplicity of his exposition                     and for the fervor of his accent.                            When he talked about the Passion of the Lord, the sorrows of Mary, and                     offenses  against  God,  his  tears  and  the  tears  of  the  listeners  were  the  best                     comment on his preaching.                            Simple and plain in form, his speech was profound in contents, affecting                     laity and clergy. Father Cosimo Spina reports that when the Father preached the                     retreat to the Franciscan tertiaries in Francavilla Fontana in 1908, he hastened                     from Ceglie to feel the spiritual delight of hearing the Father. Also other priests,                     attracted by the word of the Servant of God, came from afar. “All of us knew                     what he was saying, but we were subdued by his spiritual unction, and we had a                     glimpse of the saint in him. “","Father Risi of the Divine Providence Sons testifies that when Don Orione invited                     the Father to say some words to the novices and to the priests of his order in Bra,                     he delighted in what the Father said and in how he said it.                         Let us quote a wonderful writing of Father Vitale on the Father's preaching:                         One day he said to me, “If you knew how much I preached in Messina in my                     youth! “                         I was in the early days of my priesthood when the Father recommended me                     not to weary myself through the works of ministry. “For the next five years, “he                     said, “dedicate yourself to the study of the ecclesiastical disciplines to strengthen                     yourself on them. “                         The Father knew the qualities that a preacher of God's word must have in                     order to improve the faithful. If I am not blinded by my affection to the venerable                     Founder,  I  can  assert  that  none  of  the  many  preachers  of  Messina  penetrated                     souls so deeply as the Father did.                         To  announce  his  word,  the  Lord  endowed  the  Father  with  special  gifts.                     Everyone knows that a sacred orator must be a man of prayer, because none is                     able  to  convince  his  fellows  of  the  evangelical  truths  without  being  himself                     imbued with them, nor can he illuminate the listener's mind, without having his                     own mind illuminated, nor can he lead the faithful to virtue and to the hatred of                     vice, without being himself imbued with these feelings. The good effects of the                     preaching depend on prayer.                         We know what a man of prayer the Father was, and how zealous he was for               53                     the salvation of souls. His works showed the Father's most pure aim at achieving                     their  salvation.  Whether  when  he  made  a  simple  appeal,  or  an  important                     panegyric or whether when he taught catechism, or treated apologetic and moral                     topics, he always sought the glory of the Lord and the salvation of souls.                         The Father never sought to become a great theologian, nor a deep moralist,                     but  he  engaged  himself  in  the  study  of  the  Holy  Scripture  and  in  the  Gospel,                     because these books are the living word of God. There he found his nourishment                     for  achieving  the  intimate  union  with  our  Lord.  He  was  so  ready  to  quote                     wisdom's sayings with so much understanding in a variety of circumstances that                     he seemed to perceive those truths in God, as in a vision.                         He combined the knowledge of the Scripture with the knowledge of the lives                     and  works  of  the  saints  through  continuous  reading  and  meditation.  This                     exquisite sacred knowledge was the subject of his preaching and made of him a                     teacher of asceticism and mystics.                         If we consider that sacred knowledge was also supported by a literary culture                     the  Father  fostered  in  the  delightful  studies  of  his  youth,  as  well  as  by  the                     elegant, but sober and austere speech which adorned his talking, we can realize                     how effective his sacred preaching was. Owing to his deep understanding, his                     sensitive heart, and to the delicate topics, the Father easily touched the hearers,                     drawing tears from their eyes while his own filled.","The  great  works  of  charity  he  undertook  to  answer  the  call  of  the  Lord                     forbade him to continue his preaching in public churches. He climbed the pulpit                     only  on  occasional  invitations  when  he  could  not  decline  them,  drawing  the                     people who were eager to hear him.                         But he never stopped preaching in his communities, until his death. Triduos,                     novenas,  panegyrics,  explanation  of  the  Gospel,  moral  ascetic  and  mystical                     subjects  never  failed  the  Religious  and  the  orphans.  He  was  so  zealous  for                     infusing in our heart the love of Jesus that he never became tired. Holidays and                     Sundays without preaching were a nonsense for the Father.                         His preaching transformed the people. We priests of Messina remember the                     retreats he preached to us when we were seminarians, the spirit he infused, and                     the resolves we made as a result of the word of God! I was so impressed by his                     sermons that when I became a Priest I repeated them almost word by word to the                     clerics and to the faithful, as I had heard them from the Father's mouth!                             Declamation was another faculty that the Father cultivated in his youth.                          He  applied  the  declamation  of  classical  poetry  and  of  drama  to  sacred                     preaching. He was attractive also for the dignity and the solemnity of gestures,          54                     voice, and movements.                          The wish Father Vitale expresses at the end of his article is also our wish:                     “May the Father Founder infuse from heaven the true spirit of preaching in his                     Rogationist priests so that we and the souls entrusted to us may foster our love                     for God and holy perfection “(Bulletin, 1928, page 268).                        8. Respect for holy things                         His respect for holy things was derived from his faith.                            First is the respect for the most holy name of God. The padre pronounced                     the name of God and Jesus with the utmost reverence, allowing no one to utter                     His name in vain, even inadvertently. Among many examples of this reverence,                     we remember that he once protested against the Gazzetta, because the first letter                     of God was written in lower-case","in  a  quotation  by  the  poet  D'Annunzio.  If  he  happened  to  see  on  the  ground                     pieces of paper with the name of God or of the saints written on them, he picked                     them up so they would not be trampled on or slandered. These pieces of paper                     should be preserved or burnt “(Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 275).                         The Jesuit, Father Raimondi, a spiritual director at the seminary of Messina,                     once asked for a few religious papers to adorn the walls of the seminary on the                     occasion of a Eucharistic procession. He also wished some strings to be thrown                     down  with  the  flowers  at  the  transit  of  Jesus.  The  Father  answered,  “Very                     willingly, save the strings: while we honor Jesus in the procession, we have not                     to trample on his name, even though materially. “(2)                         The Father held priests in great respect. A manservant reports that the Father                     attracted  his  attention  because  of  his  free,  confidential  behavior  with  a  priest                     friend of his. He said, “Be careful. You must see in him a priest and a minister of                     God more than a friend. “As soon as he saw a priest entering the house, he paid a                     great respect to him with humble gestures, such as kissing his hand and asking                     his blessing. He also exhorted us to behave devoutly with the priests.                         The  Father's  respect  for  holy  things  at  the  end  of  his  life  moved  him  on                     February 1926 to mail a circular to the bishops of Italy at his own expense in                     order to remedy the anomalies in their dioceses. He relates three episodes. Once,                     celebrating in a renowned sanctuary, he saw the name of the Madonna written on                     the  footboard  of  the  altar.  “I  was  confused,  because  I  did  not  know  where  to                     place my feet in order to avoid trampling on the beautiful, venerable title of the        55                     most holy Virgin. “We harm no one by revealing that the sanctuary is that of                     Mary Helper of the Christian in Turin. The footboard was there from the time of                     Don  Bosco.  Neither  he  nor  his  successor  realized  any  inconsistency.  But  the                     Father felt that way, and he endeavored to obtain it from Don Rinaldi, the major                     rector. The Father replaced it with another one at his own expense. The former                     footboard is now in Messina, restored in a place of honor.                          On  September  21,  1897,  a  tornado  hit  the  town  of  Oria  (Brindisi),  Italy.                     Eighty  persons  died  and  hundreds  were  wounded.  The  stone  statue  of                     Immaculate Mary which was on the Hebrews' door, was beheaded. The statue                     remained in such a state for about twelve years. After the 1908 earthquake, when                     the Father opened his houses in Oria, he saw that indecent view, and wrote, “I                     was  shaken  with  terror.  After  asking  permission,  I  commissioned  an  artist  to                     remodel the Madonna's beautiful stone head with fluent hair. Now, seeing the                      statue of Our Lady crowned with twelve stars is fine. “","The  third  episode  happened  in  Gravitelli  district.  <<  There  is  a  church                     dedicated to the most holy Virgin. On the threshold were the words, \" Hail Mary                     .\" Out of necessity, people stepped on her name as they entered the church. So,                     many people trampled on the greeting of the angel who announced the human                     redemption and on the august name of the most holy Virgin !                          I easily had that step removed and substituted by another at my expense. The                     former one with the greeting of the angel and the sweetest name of the most holy                     Virgin is placed at the foot of Our Lady of Lourdes in a recess of the Holy Spirit                     institute. “He concluded, “If in your diocese there are such abnormalities as the                     names  of  our  Lord  or  the  Virgin  Mary  in  places  were  people  step  on  them                     harshly, I am ready to replace them at my expense on the condition that the old                     words  be  sent  to  me  upon  their  replacement,  because  our  institutes  will  atone                     forever. “                          Someone could say, “These are childish trifles... “People, however, should                     see  in  them  the  light  of  faith  and  the  finesse  of  love  from  which  spring  the                     spiritual  infancy  to  which  the  kingdom  of  God  is  promised.  To  understand  it,                     people had to see the Father in these circumstances... Sister Prisca bears witness                     to how the Father received that step. “He gathered all of us in the parlor, placed                     the  step  at  the  foot  of  Immaculate  Mary  while  we  were  praying  and  singing.   56                     Then he made a speech about the Madonna. At the end, we kissed the name of                     the Virgin written on the step, and returned to our work. “The same sister points                     out that the Father ordered a novena when the footboard arrived from Turin. At                     the end of the novena, they walked bare footed to pay a visit to it and to thank                      God for the granted grace.                        9. The Sacred Images                                0wing  to  his  great  love  for  the  Lord,  the  Madonna,  and  the  saints,  the                     Father revered their images.                            Today, some would like to return to the iconoclasts' times and eliminate                     the sacred images from the churches. And yet, the holy Church fought so long to                     defend them. The second Nicene Council decreed that the respect for","the sacred images is licit, and the Council of Trent confirmed the Nicene decision                     against the protestants. The second Vatican Council has confirmed the Catholic                     doctrine, but recommended moderation to avoid surprise and improper devotion                     among the faithful. However, it prescribes to keep the practice of exposing the                     sacred  images  in  the  churches  for  the  veneration  of  the  faithful  (S.C.  125;  cf.                     L.G. 67).                          The  Father  confessed,  “We  feel  a  special  transport  for  the  sacred  images                     “(S.C. Vol. 1, page 187). Sometimes, he may seem excessively devout, but it was                     customary  in  those  times,  and  the  liturgical  rubrics  even  permitted  additional                     pictures on the altars in front of the chief image!                          But, the Father wanted the images to be fitting for fostering devotion. Indeed!                     He was fond of sacred art and he never liked papier-mache' statues. He wrote,                      “A great means to lift up our mind to God and to keep faith and worship alive are                     the  images  of  our  Lord,  the  most  holy  Virgin,  and  the  saints.  So  that  sacred                     images may produce this beneficial effect, they must be beautiful and expressive.                     A  beautiful,  artistic,  devout  image  showing  a  divine,  celestial  mark  draws  our                     heart  to  contemplate  and  pray,  exciting  our  hope  and  trust.  But,  if  the  sacred                     images are not beautiful, they produce quite the opposite effect “(S.C. Vol. 1,                     page 187). (3)                                                                            57                          He sometimes showed original pretensions. Acknowledging receipt of Saint                     Luke's  Madonna,  the  Father  wrote  to  the  artist  he  had  commissioned,  “Even                     though  I  would  have  preferred  greater  eyes,  I  liked  it;  but  compared  with  the                     image, the eyes are somehow small. “So far, we do not find any originality, but                     he adds, “The Madonna had big eyes, because she had to watch the whole world                     and all the creatures! “(S.C. Vol. 5, page 125).                          We also recall the remark the Father made to Father Callisto Bonicelli of the                     Monfort Fathers, editor of Queen of Hearts, who in March 1917 printed a picture                     by Sianese Girolamo of Pacchia (1477-1538), a minor artist of the fifteen century                     orbiting around Raffaello and Sodoma.                          The  picture  presents  a  double  image:  the  Annunciation  and  the  Visitation.                     The Father writes to Bonicelli,                          To tell the truth, I did not like the picture at all. I enclose it. Please examine                     it. I am sure that  you will agree with me on the fact that the picture does not                     reproduce the sublimity and excellency of Our Lady, because no celestial, sacred,                     divine feature transpires from it. It is worthless to say that Girolamo of Pacchia is                     an artist of great repute,","because  the  reproduction  lacks  the  aesthetics  which  fosters  devotion.  It  rather                     leads to lose it.                         If the picture is a perfect replica of the original, the author made something                     inconsistent, his ability notwithstanding.                         I took the liberty to mail this letter, begging you to pardon my sincerity for                     the sake of my passionate love toward our celestial Mother (S.C. Vol. 7, page                     154).                             Father Bonicelli seeks a justification,                         Let  us  concede  that  the  most  holy  Virgin  assumes  a  strange  posture...  de                     gustibus... we cannot debate our taste... However, because we are dealing with                     two images, if you do not like the first Madonna, consider the second one, being                     lenient with Girolamo of Pacchia and with ourselves... (Queen of Hearts, 1917,                     page 380).                        10. Sacred relics and sacramentals                                                        58                              The Father paid extraordinary reverence to the holy relics, above all to the                     holy cross, preserving them in the house and providing them to the communities                     he founded. On the day of the ordination to priesthood, the Father gave to the                     first two Rogationist priests a crucifix ornate with several relics. The relic of the                     cross was in the center.                           The Father had a great reverence for the relics of the saints. Hoarding them                     devoutly, he sometimes said special prayers about them and with them because a                     relic, to his way of thinking, could save a house, a family, or a city from divine                     punishment. When in the presence of renowned relics, he celebrated the feasts of                     the respective saints solemnly “(Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 114).                     After the 1908 earthquake, he and Father Palma searched the destroyed city for                     pictures, statues, and relics.                         The Father thought of being favored by God when he happened to receive                     and preserve the relics in his institutes before","transferring them to the chancery office or to the rectors of the churches; and he                     paid them daily reverence. On February 21, 1909, he wrote from Oria to Messina                     for  the  stone  on  which  Saint  Anthony  whipped  himself,  sprinkling  it  with  his                     blood,  according  to  tradition.  He  recommended  “to  carefully  preserve  Saint                     Anthony of Padua's stone, and to give it to no one. Were any priest to ask for it,                     tell him that I will come back in a few days  (Vol. 34, page 248).                          He  preserved  with  greatest  devotion  Saint  Alphonsus'  skullcap,  the                     warming-pan and the mask of Saint Veronica Giuliani. Sometimes, he made us                     kiss  Saint  Alphonsus'  skullcap  before  giving  it  to  the  Redemptorist  Fathers  of                     Francavilla Fontana. How he behaved in his last years, when he obtained from                     the  generous  Pius  XI  the  body  of  Saint  Giulia,  virgin  and  martyr,  for  his  neo                     community  in  Rome!  “The  remains  were  received  enthusiastically.  Songs  and                     hymns to the  saint were performed by  the padre. The tomb was placed in the                     sanctum  sanctorum,  where  it  is  revered  by  the  community  and  by  the  faithful                     “(Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 262).                          The  Father  had  great  faith  in  the  sacramentals.  He  used  holy  water  in  his                     room, signed himself in the morning and in the night, and sprinkled his bed with                     it. When someone was sick, the Father suggested < a pious, effective expedient “:                     drinking holy water, “because it has the power to stop sickness. “                                                                                                               59                         In his booklet Preservation from Divine Punishment, the Father recommends                     the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God). “It is a mold of wax, in which the shape of the                     divine lamb is impressed. Its sacred value is great. “The production of them is                     entrusted to the Cistercian Monks of the Holy Cross of Jerusalem in Rome, while                     the Pope reserved to himself to “bless the Agnus Dei, imploring from the Most                     High that the persons who wear or honor them in their house be free from storms,                     falls, snares of the enemies, sickness, and any evil; and the parturient give easy                     birth. Thousands of examples show the Agnus Dei's effectiveness. “The Father                     adds some considerations,                          I  think  that  by  means  of  this  sacramental  the  Church  wants  to  eliminate                     superstitions,  such  as  the  horns  of  the  bull,  grass  against  the  evil  eye,  the                     good-luck-charm, and so on. The Christians must get rid of these superstitions,                     which weaken, destroy their faith, and attract divine punishments! How pitiable                     it is to see great men, such as scientists, who disdain to accept Christian dogmas                     and the liturgy of the holy Church, but are superstitious. They are punished in                     their conceit by God! On the contrary, the people who wear the Agnus Dei with                     faith, behave as good Christians, and fulfill the other conditions. They receive","the good effects we are talking about. Otherwise, it can become a superstition.                     God forbid! (Preface to Preservation from Divine Punishments).                          The Father had a collection of Agnus Dei: the small ones, which the persons                     wear  enclosed  in  a  case,  and  the  greater  ones  that  are  exposed  in  the  houses.                     When he was invited to bless a factory, especially if there were machines, he had                     a  beautifully  framed  Agnus  Dei  hung  on  the  wall.  In  the  1915-18  war,  his                     children who went into the army were given an Agnus Dei and were exhorted to                     wear it with faith. How many Agnus Dei the Father distributed to the persons                     running perils! In the early years of the century, when people made an attempt on                     Alphonsus XIII, king of Spain, the Father mailed to him an Agnus Dei enclosed                     in a silver case, and recommended him to wear it with faith. He did the same                     with Benito Mussolini.                          Today the sacramentals are of little importance for the faithful. The Church's                     teaching, however, through the Second Vatican Council says, “By them men are                     disposed to receive the chief effects of the sacraments, and various occasions in                     life are rendered holy... There is scarcely any proper use of material things which                     cannot thus be directed toward the sanctification of men and the praise of God.                     “Furthermore,  the  Church  suggests  the  institution  of  additional  sacramentals:                     “When  rituals  are  being  revised  as  laid  down  in  Article  63,  new  sacramentals                     may also be added as necessity requires “(S.C. 60, 61, 79).                               60                         11. Against a spreading superstition                                 I  am  closing  this  chapter  by  recalling  a  superstition  which  the  people                     practiced  in  the  Father's  time,  and  against  which  he  raised  his  voice.  We  are                     hinting at the chain letters that people mail inviting to say specific prayers, and to                     write a replica for other persons, or else. Besides preaching against this practice,                     the Father also wrote an article on God and","Neighbor to enlighten the simple and the ignorant. We quote a few passages:                          Such  a  propaganda  is  abominable,  because  it  aims  at  weakening  the  faith                     directly  and  insidiously!  Compelling  the  people  to  say  specific  prayers  or  to                     perform a religious act under pain of misfortunes is a big superstition, and those                     who believe in it become superstitious and sinners.                          Superstition is the most suitable means to weaken the most holy faith! The                     man who is afraid of an anonymous person threatening the people who do not                     say a prayer, does not fear the Lord any longer, nor trusts God. Consequently, sin                     matters  little  to  them,  even  under  the  pain  of  divine  punishment;  but  stupid                     anonymous threatening matters too much.                          Doesn't it lead to loss of faith in God? For instance, many women who are                     afraid of anonymous threatening do not fear God for dressing immodestly. They                     even receive Communion at the altar in that attire!                          And if preachers threaten them with divine punishments for sins, they do not                     believe!                          Threatening with misfortunes the people who neglect a specific prayer and its                     propaganda influences the simple. The Father warns them,                                  61                          Be quiet!... Misfortunes are averted by  the holy fear of God, because it is                     written, “If a man fears the Lord, evil will not come his way “(Si., 33, 1).                          What is the fear of God all about? It is avoidance of sin, observance of the                     commandments of God and of the law of his Church, love for Jesus and the most                     holy  Virgin,  doing  good  to  our  neighbor,  respect  for  people,  reception  of  the                     sacraments,  and  prayer.  This  is  the  real  preservation  from  misfortunes!  Some                     persons instead would like to live in their own way, and to be free from God's                     punishments because of a superstitious work or prayer.                          The Father explains the difference between the punishments of God and the                     tribulation  of  life,  which  we  have  to  accept  from  the  divine  hand  in  order  to                     achieve eternal life. At last, he shouts,                      Long live Jesus and the most holy Virgin! Long live the Catholic faith! Long                     live the Catholic, apostolic, and Roman Church! Long live the Pope, Vicar of                     Jesus Christ! Down with deceit, superstition, and hellish snares of the enemies of                     God and the holy faith!>) (S.C. Vol. 1, page 183).","Notes                             (1)  These are some of the Father's thoughts on the gospel, from his panegyric on                     Saint Mark: “The gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is the divine covenant gentlest, and                     loving mysteries of incarnation, birth, infancy, life, passion, death, and resurrection of                     our Lord Jesus Christ, as well as the delightful mysteries of our redemption and eternal                     happiness. The light of the gospel dispersed the darkness of death looming on miserable                     humankind. The clear source of the gospel watered the Church of Jesus Christ, making                     her blooming and pleasant like a pretty garden. The beauty of the evangelical doctrine                     opened new horizons of peace and love to man, making him love the true, eternal good                     and making his nature nobler. In short, the gospel is the restoration of fallen humanity,                     its salvation, its earthly and eternal happiness. The redemption itself would be fruitless                     without  the  gospel  “(Vol.  145,  page  256).  The  following  thoughts  are  from  his                     panegyric  on  Saint  Euplio  deacon,  martyr  for  the  gospel.  “The  Gospel!  Here  is  the                     divine  code,  which  amazed  the  wise  of  the  world,  replacing  the  teaching  of  the                     Areopagus  and  of  the  Peripatetics.  It  manifests  the  greatest  mysteries  with  greatest                     simplicity. It is the holy book which revealed the eternal destiny of man and proclaimed                     that all human beings are children of the same Father! The gospel is destined to triumph                     over  human  bias  and  to  redeem  the  peoples  from  the  darkness  of  death  by  being                     preached over all the world. \" The power that has conquered the world is this faith of                     ours  \".  “(1.  John  5,  4).  The  Father  recalls  that  meditation  on  the  gospel  in  the  first   62                     centuries  of  the  Church:  “Christians  died  for  the  gospel  to  confess  the  divine  truths.                     However, they had already meditated on these truths before facing trial. As a matter of                     fact,  the  Christians  gathered  even  in  the  catacombs,  where  the  deacons  read  and                     expounded the gospel. The Supreme Pontiffs supervised everything, and moved by the                     Holy Spirit they directed this divine teaching of knowledge and salvation with infallible                     “magisterium \". In those times the Christians held in such esteem the holy books that                     they did not convey them to the pagans, even at the cost of their lives. If one yielded                     under pressure of persecution, he was considered a traitor o (Ibid. page 332). May the                     gospel  be the rule of our behavior:  “Let  us conform our life to  the principles  of the                     gospel, bearing in our mind that in the judgment day, we have to give an account to God                     who will judge according to the teaching , the rules, the precepts, and the examples of                     that divine book “(Ibid. page 344).                      (2)  A  sister  writes  that  on  the  occasion  of  a  Eucharistic  procession  the  Father  made                     people throw out slips of paper with the inscription, “Jesus, heal us! “Obviously, the                     sister does not remember well.                         The invocation, “Jesus, heal us, “took place in 1914 in an extraordinary occasion, i.                     e., the international Eucharistic congress of Lourdes, which ended","with the solemn procession among files of sick people imploring healing from Jesus.                            On that day, the Father ordered a Eucharistic procession in our communities to                        be  in  spiritual  communion  with  the  procession  of  Lourdes.  Moved  by  faith,  he                        planned  an  original  practice.  Along  the  way  of  the  procession,  some  groups  of                        persons should represent the activities of the institute: the religious congregations,                        the orphanages for boys and girls, the poor, etc. Each person should bear on his/her                        chest a badge indicating the specific activity of the institute, and all of them with                        raised hands should implore Jesus,  while passing in  procession, by saying, “Lord                        Jesus in the Sacrament, have mercy on us, heal us, heal us! “The Father wrote, “All                        of us are sick in  the soul more than in  the body. Therefore, we have to long for                        healing  our  spiritual  more  than  our  bodily  sickness  “(S.C.  Vol.  5,  page  26).                        Obviously, the slips of papers have nothing to do here.                      (3) The Father introduces the painter, Basile of Taranto, to the public with these words                        in an article: “More than once she vividly painted pictures of particular beauty for                        our churches... We have presented the famous artist to the public esteem and to the                        pastors of the churches of Italy so that they may take advantage by commissioning                        beautiful pictures according to their necessity “(Ibid.).                      (4) He had written before: “Pure Christian behavior, holy fear of God, prayer, devotion                        to  the  Sacred  Heart  and  to  the  most  holy  Virgin,  alms,  and  then  prudent  human                        means and surrender to God. “                                                                                                               63","64","3.                                                                                                   “SON                                                                                         OF THE                                                                                    CHURCH”                           1.

Love for the Pope, sign of predestination                              0ur Founder inherited faithfulness to the Church and love for the Pope from                     his family. We remind that his Father was appointed Pontifical Vice-Consul in                     Messina and honorary captain of the papal navy for his orthodoxy of principles.                     His uncles, the Priests Joseph Toscano and  Raphael Di Francia, in the stormy                     times of the revolution when quite a few of the clergy were sympathizing with it,                     openly declared themselves defenders of the papacy and became co-founders of                     The Catholic Word. It was the only Catholic periodical of the city; it defended                     the rights of the Church and of the Pope in an environment so hostile that the lay                     authority condemned and suspended it.                          One  day,  dressed  in  his  Sunday  clothes,  Hannibal  dashed  toward  a  young                     ruffian who was shouting profanities against the Pope Pius IX before the people                     in the cathedral square, assaulted him quickly, and thus silenced him. The love                     for the Church and the devotion to the Pope vibrated strongly in his heart. In his                     own funeral oration he bears an open witness to these feelings:                      He loved the Church, humiliated himself very lovingly before the Pope, was                     sorry  when  evil  progressed  but  was  glad  when  good  did  “  (S.C.  Vol.  7,  page   66                     241).                          In a prayer, he presents to the most holy Trinity the praises and the blessings                     of the angels and the saints, of the most holy Virgin Mary and Jesus in hypostatic                     union with the Word, and adds:                           Through  these  praises  and  blessings  I  intend  to  thank  you,  up  to  the                     consumption of myself because through the suffering and death of our Lord Jesus                     Christ  and  through  the  sorrows  of  his  most  holy  Mother  you  established  your                     Church  for  the  salvation  of  souls:  the  Catholic,  apostolic,  Roman  Church                     endowed with the priesthood, the sacraments, and the merits of your","incarnate Word” (S.C. Vol. 9, page 228).                          The Father thought that love for the Pope was a sign of predestination. Let us                     quote the wonderful closing of his funeral oration on Pope Leo XIII in Messina                     Cathedral:                          When our Lord Jesus Christ, betrayed by Judas, condemned by the impious                     Jews, and nailed to the cross breathed his last crying aloud, a beneficial change                     of heart resulted in a few. One of the two thieves crucified at Jesus' side, touched                     by  the  patience  of  that  just  one  who  died  forgiving  his  enemies,  repented,                     acknowledged him as God and asked that he be allowed to share in his kingdom.                     Contemplating at the foot of the cross the celestial features of the divine victim,                     the centurion exclaimed: “He really was the Son of God! “ Some of the Hebrews                     standing there came down from the hill beating their breast!                          Recently, Jesus Christ' Vicar died after a wretched, crucified life inside the                     walls of his uninterrupted dwelling, and his last day appeared to be a test of the                     judgment on the reprobate and the elect.                          Many adversaries of the papacy, who opposed the Pope through the press,                     and  others  who  disagreed  because  of  different  religious  ideas  awakened                     exclaiming  before  the  venerable  remains  of  the  sacred,  illustrious  dead:  “He    67                     really  was  Jesus  Christ's  Vicar!  “  But,  others  remained  impassive!  There  are                     Hebrew crucifiers that persist in their devilish hate against the Pope, whatever                     may be his name, Pius or Leo or Gregory; others are hopeless; others run to hang                     themselves as Judas did!                          “These are children of perdition, destined to the Gehenna's fire; but those of                     gentle heart who love Jesus Christ's Vicar, have their name written in the book of                     life !” (Vol. 45, page 59).                       2. To understand one another                        Before continuing our topic, we need to recall the Father's times.                            “The  current  process  of  secularization  repudiates  the  past  and  even                     charges of fetishism the manifestations of respect and the dutiful obedience to                     authority. This is the reason why some difficulties spring in the Church's womb;                     indocile, unfaithful ministers, and consecrated souls cause sharp grieves” (Paul                     VI, October 9, 1971).","These persons try to justify the spirit of contradiction and revolt in the name                     of the Council, interpreting falsely and abusively; as though the Council wanted                     to break off the doctrine of the tradition, repudiating the pre-Council Church in                     order  to  conceive  a  new  Church  from  within:  “new  in  the  constitution,  in  the                     dogma, in the morals, and in the canon law “ (Paul VI, June 23, 1972). In the                     name  of  democracy,  they  seem  to  want  a  clean  sweep  even  of  the  personal                     institutions of our Lord. Paul VI declares: “The government of the Church cannot                     assume the aspects and the rules of the temporal governments, which today are                     sometimes  guided  by  excessive  institutions  of  democracy,  or  by  totalitarian                     forms which are contrary to human dignity. The government of the Church has                     its own original form which aims at expressing the wisdom and the will of its                     divine Founder “ (October 11, 1969). Therefore, “the constitution of the Church                     cannot be changed in such a way as if the authority should originate from the                     basis or from the majority, and not from Christ by the will of God “ (June 18,                     1972).                          The Holy Father feels that the “smoke of Satan entered the temple of God                     through a leak; that something preternatural came into the world to perturb, to                     suffocate the fruits of the Ecumenical Council, and to hinder the Church from                     singing the hymn of joy for having recovered the awareness of itself “ (June 29,                     1972). Specifically, the enemies < seem to aim at dissolving the ecclesiastical \"         68                     magisterium.  \"  They  so  by  equivocating  on  the  pluralism.  As  though  the                     pluralism were the free interpretation of the doctrine and the free co-existence of                     opposite ideas. Or by equivocating on the concept of subsidiariness. As though                     subsidiariness were synonymous of autonomy. Or by equivocating on the local                     Church. As though the local Church were cut off, free, and self-supporting. Or by                     leaving out of consideration the doctrine defined by Popes and Councils “ (June                     24, 1972).                          In  the  Father's  times  it  was  different:  \"  Satan's  smoke  \"  did  not  enter  the                     Church. The Father is a traditionalist: he sees in the bishops the successors to the                     apostles; he sees in the Pope the successor to Saint Peter, the successor to the                     same  Christ.  He  sees  in  the  Pope  the  Sweet  Christ  on  earth,  according  to  the                     expression  of  the  seraphic  Catherine  of  Siena.  The  Second  Vatican  Council                     reaffirms the perennial teaching of the Church: “These apostles he constituted in                     the  form  of  a  college  or  permanent  assembly,  at  the  head  of  which  he  placed                     Peter, chosen from them “ (L.G.,","19). And: “Just as, in accordance with the Lord's decree, Saint Peter and the rest                     of the apostles constitute a unique apostolic college, so in like fashion the Roman                     Pontiff,  Peter's  successor,  and  the  bishops,  the  successors  of  the  apostles,  are                     related with and united to one another “ (L.G. 22). The Catholic will listen to                     their  teaching  this  way:  “Bishops  who  teach  in  communion  with  the  Roman                     Pontiff  are  to  be  revered  by  all  as  witnesses  of  divine  and  Catholic  truth;  the                     faithful, for their part, are obliged to submit to their bishops' decision, made in                     the name of Christ, in matters of faith and morals, and to adhere to it with a ready                     and respectful allegiance of mind. This loyal submission of the will and intellect                     must be given, in a special way, to the authentic teaching authority of the Roman                     Pontiff, even when he does not speak ex cathedra in such wise, indeed, that his                     supreme teaching authority be acknowledged with respect, and sincere assent be                     given  to  decisions  made  by  him,  conformably  with  his  manifest  mind  and                     intention “ (L.G. 25).                          The Father lived this doctrine with spirit of faith. We will prove it later.                        3.  Love and subjection to the holy Church                                                                                                                69                          In a chapter of the 1914 constitutions for the Rogationists the Father wrote:                         “The Rogationists of Jesus' Heart will be very loving, obedient children and                     most  humble  subjects  of  the  holy  Church,  which  is  represented  by  the  Holy                     Father, the Roman Sacred Congregations, the prelates, and the bishops who have                     juridical power over their religious houses.                         They will nurture such a reverence, subjection, and greatest tender love as to                     reach  veneration  (1)  toward  the  Holy  Father,  holding  him  as  our  Lord  Jesus                     Christ,  whose  Vicar  he  is,  and  his  word,  either  written  or  spoken,  as  Jesus                     Christ's word. They will make almost no distinction between ex cathedra and not                     ex cathedra,  holding  even the Holy  Father's  private opinions and  sentences as                     venerable. Heartily concerned with his","vicissitudes, pains, and works, they will recommend him to the most holy Heart                     of Jesus in their prayer in common. On his patron saint's day, his birthday, and                     the  like,  they  will  present  their  homages  and  wishes,  also  publishing  articles                     through the institute's periodicals. While preaching or teaching Christian doctrine                     or educating the  youth, they will inspire love, reverence, and obedience to the                     Holy  Father,  giving  lectures  on  the  doctrine  about  the  Roman  Pontiff  and  his                     infallibility, as well as calling to mind the ecclesiastical history's glorious events,                     which are related to the Supreme Pontiff “ (Vol. 3, pages 32, 33).                        4.  Contributing to                        “The Catholic Word”                                 Let  us  see  how  the  Father  showed  his  love  for  the  Church  and  for  the                     Pope.                            When a youth, the Father used The Catholic Word to publish his works.                     During the First Vatican Council he published in installments a poem in black                     verses,  under  the  title  The  Church  and  the  Ecumenical  Council  of  1870.  The    70                     author  sings  the  praises  of  the  Church,  its  holiness  and  grandeur,  gradually                     recounting the triumphs of its chief events from Christ to the Nicene Council,                     and to the First Vatican Council:                             Hail, Church of God! On your forehead,                            Crowned with eternal flowers,                            The majesty of your triumphs shines!                            Like a queen wrapping up her tresses                            With manly band, you flash the royal eyes                            To the warlike clangors of the battle.                            Untamed and severe empress,                            More beautiful in your holy fury,                            You are shining with triumphs, hinting                            At a victory, which an immortal angel                            Is preparing for the bow of your holy days,                            Where God is resting, waiting for you!                          After singing the battles and the victories of the Church","through the centuries, he ends wishing its triumphs all over the world with the                     Council:                            ...Oh, come,                            Come, O Lord; here the world summons you                            Through the voice of thousand famous children                            Gathered in the divine temple! Oh, come and unify                            The world in your Church!                          On July 18, 1870, when the papal infallibility was proclaimed, he ended his                     dedication to the Pope with this wonderful adhesion:                          We  join  the  Catholics'  universal  vow,  and  looking  at  Peter's  infallible                     cathedra we say: we greet you, immortal Pius IX, the universal Church's doctor,                     Christ's Vicar, the mystical bride's sublime guardian, Peter's boat's celestial pilot.                     At last, we greet you, glorious Pontiff, that in 24 splendid years sublimated your                     name, which is a new pearl of the coming history and a sacred glory of posterity.                     We greet you, loving father, and with the five regions of the earth we salute you                     five times great! Five times infallible! (S.C. Vol. I, page 10).                          The Father's youth reminds times of great tribulation for the Church: the fight                     against its temporal power and “magisterium. “ These are the Syllabus' times,                     when the hellish powers awakened, filling the Pope's heart with bitterness. The           71                     Father seized any opportunity to protest his faithfulness to Pius IX, through filial,                     passionate verses springing from his heart.                              He shares in full the Pope's sorrows in those sad times:                             O saint,                            Look at me; kneeling at your feet                            I wail, hope, and pray. In my youth,                            Worn out by the fight of the shuddering abyss,                             I felt the execrable, inevitable hurricane                            Rushing upon my soul!                            It was the madness of the fool, and the cruel                            Arising of an Erinys in the midst of the camp                            Of the boiling spirits, and the idea                            Of an Italian grandeur! O mournful                            Stories of blood! May they fall into                            The eternal oblivion, O Father: so gloomy a remembrance                            May never return to your angelic heart! ...                             ... Watered                            With tears is my life; either I delight                            In the gloomy notes, or I seek","A joyous song, I always feel                            The string of the sorrow under my fingers,                            Error enraging !                          The name of Pius IX will give splendor to his poems:                             ...Inspired by your holy picture,                            I will sing, girding my strings                            With the most beautiful roses, reaped                            In the early morning, in my native valley;                            Pilgrim of songs, I will move around                            To awaken the sons of men.                            Of my song, your name will be                            The most beautiful note;                            As it is true that the poet has a faithful                            Future, secret echo of his song                            Running on the winds, I will broadcast                            The harmonious note of your name                            Through the immensity of the world,                            Awakening the sweetest affections;                            For in your name I find something                            Holy, fondling with celestial breeze                                               72                            And worthy a thousand songs!...                                                    (Vol. 47, pages 112 and 114).                          We have the verses for the Golden Priestly Anniversary of Pius IX, on April                     11, 1869; those of August 23, 1871, when the Pope fulfills the  years of Saint                     Peter's  Pontificate;  and  Recollection  in  the  City  of  Rome,  written  after  the                     occupation  of  the  city  by  the  Italian  army.  The  poet  hints  at  the  grandeur  of                     pagan Rome, singing the praise of the Christian city around the Vicar of Christ.                     Above all, we recall Sorrows and Triumphs, a long poly-meter song on the 25th                     anniversary  of  Pius  IX's  crowning,  June  21,  1871;  with  fleeing  touches,  he                     describes  the sectarian fight against the  Church and  the Pope. It is one of the                     Father's  best  works.  Very  fine  are  the  octaves  where  the  poet  describes  the                     condition of Italy betrayed by its children. We quote:                             As one day on the impious Babel,                            The genius which deranges the world                            Terribly arising to the stars                            In the battle defied God.                            Here he came from the horrid hell,                            From its thundering abyss,","And from the Italian mountains                     To new battles he again defied God!                      Beautiful Italy, bearing divine eyes                     Wet with dewy tears,                     You are dragging yourself into error                     Like a merciless object.                     Where is the mysterious sparkle,                     Which enlivened you in your faith,                     Showing you the foreign eyes                     As the lady of great beauty ?                      You, sublime in the great perils,                     You, celestial in the genius of art,                     You, generous mother of children,                     Were bearing the shining faith in your breast.                     Today, crushed by deadly fury,                     As a slave you are dragging out your life,                     Betrayed by your own children,                     Furiously binding your feet!                      Among the elation and the new faults                     Of the folk that calls you great,                     That passes like a deadly wave                                                            73                     Breaking the cross and the altar;                     While you are in the hands of a rebel mob                     Tearing your splendid dress,                     Tell me, O Italy, are these the glories                     That your children's zeal is giving ?                      Unfortunate! Don't you feel                     The hideous combat of thousand rages ?                     Don't you see them offering you                     The poison hidden in the goblet of flowers ?                     The hand which interweaves and lays                     Delicate flowers on your high forehead                     Is the hand which tears your diadem,                     Is the hand which tears your womb!                      Oh! Don't you see the hideous challenge                     Of a mob fed on blood,                     That directs the homicidal sword                     Against an incomparable angel ? But the horror of the serpent's children                     Has filled up the divine cup,                     Perhaps the day of God is coming,                     That day will be for all!","5. Dreaming of the reconciliation                             We  know  the  events  and  the  happenings  following  the  end  of  the  Popes'                     temporal power.                         Writing about these events in a footnote to Recollection in the City of Rome,                     published in Faith and Poetry (1921, page 108), the Father expresses his ideas:                          The author wrote these verses shortly after the Italian army took over the city                     of Rome, when the feelings of the Catholics lovers of the Pope were wounded in                     their attachment to the Vicar of Christ, being unaware of the future.                          History has showed that, as usual, any event goes to the glory of God, who                     has permitted the end of the Popes' temporal power for the glorification of the                     papacy. In fact, since Rome has been joined to Italy, the enemies of papacy have                     realized  its  glory  and  the  unshakable  stability  of  its  divine  institution,  against                     which human and hellish powers cannot prevail. The infallible promise of our                     Lord Jesus Christ has been confirmed in 20 centuries!                          In the whirl of passions, in the clash of parties and the excitement of nations,                     the  Vicar  of  Christ  performed  his  noble,  sublime  duty  as  a  pacifier  and       74                     admonisher for over fifty years since the taking over of the city of Rome, being                     the generous, holy representative of Christ Redeemer and God!                          The  Italian  conscience  remained  enchanted  at  the  foot  of  the  unshakable                     Vatican  rock,  at  the  triumphs  of  an  unarmed  very  old  man,  whom  the  world                     admires  with  amazement!  The  people  who  only  knew  the  papacy  through  the                     mockery and the calumnies of the press were disenchanted and began admiring                     and loving what they now see and touch with their hands!                          As for the Roman Question, the author of these poems relies completely on                     the Vicar of Jesus Christ and his successors, also longing that our mother Italy be                     great, generous, and powerful as the nation privileged by God.                          The action of Providence is evidently marvelous, but it does not relieve from                     responsibility; if the papacy's temporal power in","those times seemed to be anachronistic, the Italian government's arbitrary taking                     possession of it perturbed the conscience of the Italian Catholics. The situation                     was made clear through the treaty and concordat on February 11, 1929, when,                     according to Pius XI's saying, “God was given back to Italy, and Italy to God. “                     (2)                          Oh, how long the Father dreamed of the reconciliation! One of our Religious                     had  hardly  heard  the  announcement  of  the  great  event  in  the  afternoon  of                     February 11, 1929, when he exclaimed: “I wish the Father were here now! The                     joy would have cured him! “ But he was not allowed to see the day he desired,                     which made Italy envied among the nations!                              In the funeral oration on Leo XIII, he said:                          < O my Italy! O my Italy! When will you understand your great privilege,                     your glory for being predestined by God to be the center of the Catholicism, the                     See of the Supreme Pontificate ? Don't you realize how the world looks at you,                     how two hundred million Catholics all over the world palpitate when they hear                     your name, how the great powers wait for the divine oracle which is born and                     dwells in you, and almost always is one of your children ? O glory of the glories!                     The prophet was speaking of  you, when he said: \" He dealt not so with other                     nations! \" O Italy, understand your divine fortune. If you were close to the throne       75                     of  Peter,  obedient  to  the  Vicar  of  Christ,  full  of  his  blessings,  and  free  from                     anathemas, you would be the queen of the world, and the nations would serve                     you as your maidservants ! “ (Vol. 45, page 53).                        6. For the Pope's freedom                                The liberals and the sectarians who formed the Italian government after                     taking  over  Rome,  thought  that  the  match  with  the  Pope  was  over.  On  the                     contrary, Pius IX and his successors did not accept the arbitrary action and the                     injustice that overwhelmed the Church compelling the Pope to live as a prisoner                     in  the  Vatican.  Now  and  then  the  Pope  renewed  his  protest  against  such  a                     situation, and the Catholics could not help taking sides with him. In those years,                     the","Father continuously reminds the persecuted Church and the Pope as prisoner. On                     May  10,  1906,  he  conceives  the  “plan  for  a  spiritual  crusade,  a  universal                     association of prayer for the liberation of the Pope from his long captivity in the                     Vatican.  “  Quoting,  “The  Church  prayed  to  God...  unremittingly  “  for  the                     liberation  of  Peter  (Acts,  12,  5),  among  other  practices  he  proposes  that  each                     associate consecrate an hour a day to this purpose in order to cover the daily 24                     hours. Furthermore, the associate should face suffering and even death for the                     liberation of the Vicar of Christ, in order to comfort him through obedience, love,                     offering, pilgrimages, the press, etc.                          The  Father  asks  a  question:  “How  can  the  Pope  be  free  ?  Through  the                     breakdown  of  Italy  ?  Through  a  pact  ?  Through  the  conversion  (of  the                     government) ? “ Since he is not a politician, he offers no proposal. The solution                     of  the  question  was  so  hard  that  more  than  one  who  suggested  a  proposal,                     failed... For this reason the Father says: “What God wants. He is able to change                     the hearts, the circumstances, and everything. We want to see the Pope free in his                     personal liberty, which he is lacking, even though he is the Vicar of Jesus Christ                     !  Let  us  consider  the  Pope  as  a  person:  this  sacred,  august  person  who                     embodies... is in chains “ (S.C. Vol. 9, page 158).                          The plan of forming such an association wasn't put into practice because it                     would  hurt  the  civil  authority.  The  Father,  however,  did  not  forget  it,  and  in   76                     1908,  when  he  founded  the  Pious  Union  of  Saint  Anthony  of  Padua,  he  also                     assigned to the associates the following intention: “That the present situation of                     the  Vicar  of  Jesus  Christ,  who  out  of  necessity  stays  like  a  prisoner  in  the                     Vatican, may come to an end quickly and he may go out and act freely. “                          Among the intentions assigned to the spiritual pilgrimage to Paray in 1923,                     the  intention  for  the  Pope  is  worded  in  the  following  way:  “For  the  reigning                     Pontiff and his holy freedom, as well as for the freedom of his successors up to                     the end of the world “ (S.C. Vol. 5, page 64). While writing, especially in the                     years  nearer  to  the  taking  over  of  Rome,  the  Father  often  reminds  the  sad                     conditions of the Pope and of the Church.                          When the Father was still a young priest, he wrote a prayer to Immaculate                     Mary,  calling  her  “Type  of  the  Church,  “  which  title  has  been  given  by  the                     Second Vatican Council (L.G., 63). We quote: “O Mary ! As a priest I entreat                     you for the whole","Catholic Church! You were image and type of the Church! O Mary, see to it that                     the Church become pure and without wrinkles, as in the apostles' saying. Sanctify                     the clergy, recall the religious orders to spiritual life, crowd the Church with holy                     virgins! “ (Vol. 7, page 158). Here is a piece of incomparable apostrophe:                          O Immaculate Mary, O conqueror of hell, look devoutly and benignly at the                     Catholic Church! See the vineyard watered by the red vein of your beloved Son.                     O Mary, see how the storm passed over it! The branches are broken, the trees                     thrown down, and all of it is covered by briers and thorns. Here is the city placed                     on the top of the mountain. O Supreme Queen, see how the murderers rushed in                     it: the temples are deserted, the religious houses crumbled, and even the stones of                     the sanctuaries are dragged in the mud!                          The mystical fold is assaulted by wolves; the ewe lambs sway, disperse, ruin,                     and  perish!  O  Mary!  O  Mary!  Come,  hasten!  You  are  the  army,  the  tower  of                     David: the enemies of the name of God will disappear at your appearing!                          You are implored by all the people; please come, do not be late! O Morning                     Star, bring the sun of grace and virtue! You are the star of the sea; Peter's boat is                     shaken by the storms; it cannot perish because of your Son's promise. The souls,                     however,  perish,  and  Satan  devours  his  victims!  Come  and  crush  his  head.  O                     Immaculate Mary, your will is enough; if you ask your Son, he will make his               77                     Church triumph.                          Oh! Why doesn't your Jesus come to untie the chains binding his Church ?                     Isn't his Vicar prisoner and wailing in the Vatican ?                          But his judgments are holy, his ways unfathomable, and he is always as just                     as praise worthy. Flat on our face, we adore him. But we do not stop wailing,                     crying, howling, and spreading ashes on our head, because the enemies of the                     name  of  God  are  triumphing,  keeping  the  queen  of  the  nations  as  a  slave!  O                     Mary,  O  beautiful  Immaculate  Mother,  remember  that  you  are  the  glory  of                     Jerusalem, the joy of Israel, the honor of the people of God! Therefore, hasten,                     come  all  at  once  to  throw  down  and  disperse  the  hellish  troops,  making  the                     mystical spouse of your divine Son resurrect to a new life (Vol. 22, page 79).                          On the occasion of the national pilgrimage in the 1881 jubilee, the Father                     wrote an article on  The Catholic  Word  for  Leo  XIII  (October 12, 1881), and                     after touching upon the obstinate war against the Pope, he said:                          Unhappy! They do not know that your weapons are more powerful and terrible than theirs.                     They do not know that your sword is prayer, your shield is justice, your fortress is sacrifice,                     your armor is faith, and your lightnings are your words!... Your holy prayer is a sweetest","music when you are moved in the innermost of your Fatherly heart mourn over                     the misfortune of the poor, and pray to God to appease his anger. O venerable                     Pontiff of Jesus Christ, may God bless your lips; wording the wise and effective                     prayer!  O  august  Chief  of  the  Catholic  Church,  blessed  be  your  heart  which                     harbors  the  holy  wishes  of  perfect  charity.  O  holy,  O  great,  O  unconquerable                     Pontiff, please do not stop praying for the whole world. May the angels present                     your  petitions  in  the  odor  of  sweetness  to  God  so  that  the  Church  raise  from                     depression more pure and beautiful becoming again teacher of the people, queen                     o1 the nations, and salvation of all !                          We  have  various  works  by  the  Father  in  prose  and  verses  about  several                     Popes, until Pius XI. Here we quote only two ideas concerning these times of                     general protest !                          People  speak  so  much  of  the  Vatican's  luxury  !  Listen  to  the  Father,  who                     remembers  his  staying  in  the  pontifical  waiting-room,  before  going  to  the                     audience with Benedict XV:                          What  decorum,  what  majesty  in  these  Vatican  antechambers  adorned  with                     deep blue satin and arabesque carpets, as well as with checkered gilded vaults!                     Here we feel that luxury in its severe simplicity is not luxury, but demonstration,                     symbol, reflection of the superhuman pontifical grandeur. It is a slight homage to        78                     the Vicar, the vicegerent of Jesus Christ, the Pope, the ruler of the consciences,                     the  emperor  of  all  emperors.  There,  people  long  with  thrilling  reverential                     expectation to be presented to the chief of the holy Church, to the vice-God, to                     whom the divine Savior said: “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven                     ! “ (Mt. 16, 19). (S.C. Vol. 1, page 158).                          In 1891, in the eulogy of Ludwig Windthorst, a valiant hero of the Church                     who opposed Bismarck's arrogance, the Father proposed him as a model of the                     militant Catholics who are unconditionally faithful to the teaching of the Church:                          We must be valiant without letting us be frightened by human respect; we are                     not  ashamed  to  be  called  Catholics,  because  Jesus  Christ  said,  “The  one  who                     disowns me in the presence of men, I will disown in the presence of my Father in                     heaven. “ We have to manifest our religion both in our works and in the purity of                     the principles. Far be from us the half-Catholicism which accepts the articles of                     the  law  reservedly;  which  respects  the  Vicar  of  Jesus  Christ  under  condition;                     which compromises with the adversaries of the Church; in short, the Catholicism                     which is not pure, not entire, but mixed with the false","principles of the world. Those who belong to such Catholicism call themselves                     children of the Church, but are not afraid of being suitors and supporters of the                     Church's enemies (S.C. Vol. 1, pag. 70).                        7. Affronts to the Pope                                The  Father  was  very  sorry  for  the  affronts  to  the  Pope;  to  atone,  he                     ordered  triduos  of  prayers.  The  Pope  was  Jesus  Christ  for  him,  as  he  often                     repeated in his preaching.                     In Perugia he saw the monument built in remembrance of the 1859 revolution,                     named “the Perugia's massacre. “ This episode was widely exploited against the                     Church by diplomacy and by national and foreign liberal press through the image                     of the griffin (symbol of the city) crushing the tiara. The Father was wounded by                     that sight until his death.                         When  Father  Santoro  went  to  hear  Father  Gavotti  of  the  ACI,  who  was                     responsible for morals, the Father recommended to him candidly and warmly to                     tell  Father  Gavotti  to  do  his  best  to  eliminate  that  obscenity,  which  was  a                     perennial affront to the Pope and to the Church. People remedied this a few years                     later.                                                                                    79                         We know the Father's opinion about Carducci: “A scholar, a writer, a man of                     letters, but not a poet “ (Vol. 47, VI). Such an opinion is questionable, (3) but we                     cannot help agreeing with him when he disapproves the priests involved in the                     “conventional admiration of Carducci, “ hater of the Pope and of the Church.                          When a writer, says he, brazenly exceeds the bounds of honesty, offending                     sacrilegiously and satanically God, or the adorable divine Savior along with his                     most holy Mother, or the saints, or the religion, or the Pope, we assert that even                     though such impious a writer be a real poet, or artist, or scholar, etc. etc.... if a                     minister  of  the  religion,  a  priest  of  Christ  admires,  praises,  celebrates  him,  he                     commits a misdeed. Making distinction between the poet and the unbeliever, the                     artist and the sacrilegious man in the same person is an irrelevant reason !... I                     compare  these  admirers  to  a  man  who  while  seeing  his  father  being  beaten,                     admires the skill of the beater in managing the stick by saying: I am sorry that                     my Father is being beaten, but I cannot help admiring the skill and the agility of                     the beater !","He concludes:                         Are the children of darkness that admire the writings and the works imbued                     with  satanic  hate  against  God  and  his  Church,  even  though  these  works  have                     some literary or artistic value. Satan knows how to appear as an angel of light,                     breathing in the intellect and in the fantasy of the men associated with him!...                     And  yet, even some priests let themselves be bound to  the  Carducci's balloon                     inflated by the sectarians! (S.C. 1, page 105).                        8. Witnesses                                The Father was always very reverent to the dispositions of the Church. He                     often  spoke  to  us  of  the  Pope  enthusiastically,  exciting  feelings  of  love  and                     devotion to the Vicar of Jesus Christ, received the teaching of the Church with                     veneration,  and  required  of  us  to  make  no  distinction  between  teaching  ex                     cathedra and not ex cathedra. In his last will, he specified that he was a devout                     son  of  the  Church.  Holding  in  veneration  the  definitions  of  the  Councils,  the                     ecclesiastical law, the decrees of the Roman Pontiffs and of the bishops, he never        80                     allowed people to deviate from the teaching of the Church... Among his writings,                     the  Letter  to  the  Friends  follows  the  traces  of  the  old  apologists  and  bears                     witness  to  his  perfect  adhesion  to  the  Catholic  faith.  When  the  Church  had                     spoken  through  the  mouth  of  the  Pope,  any  distinction  between  dogmatic  and                     disciplinary decisions was irrelevant for him.                          If people criticized the Pope, the Father blushed. He forbade his clerics to                     read the books which did not bring forth the exact teaching of the Church with                     veneration. For this reason he disliked Grisar's work on Saint Peter, which had a                     great vogue in those times, lest the youth deviated from full submission to the                     Pope.                          A former orphan remembers that the Father went to Rome in the first days                     she had entered the institute: “We were wailing for his leaving, but he consoled                     us by promising a gift for each of us. On his return, he related to us a report,                     giving the blessing of the Pope and the promised gift. “","9. The prayers for the Pope                                In addition to the Father's protest of love for the Church and the Pope (cf.                     no. 1), we add his following words: “In my humble prayer... first I will remember                     the Pope and his holy intentions “ (Vol. 44, page 123).                         Sister Vittoria reports: < The Father loved the Pope with a singular affection.                     In the  mass,  Communion, rosary, and in all the feasts the Father  exhorted the                     Religious and the orphans to pray first for the intentions of the Holy Father. How                     lovingly he spoke of the Pope, and how much he longed that one flock and one                     shepherd be made! “                          In plenty of prayers to the Lord, the Madonna under various titles, and the                     saints, the Father implores for the Pope “perfect holiness, special consolations,                     and the grace to guide the elects to holiness and eternal life. “ He also prays for                     the triumph... of the holy Church and for the “sanctification of its members “ so                     that “they flourish everywhere like a pleasant garden of holiness and virtues “                     (S.C. Vol. 10, page 17).                          Saint Pius X once sent an offering to the orphans through Cardinal Gennari,                     asking their prayers for a special grace. You can imagine how the Father fostered         81                     the children's fervor! He himself, on that occasion, wrote an ardent “petition to                     the Lord in the Sacrament to obtain the grace for the Holy Father through Saint                     Anthony of Padua “ (Vol. 4, page 104).                          When France parted from the Church, the Father ordered his communities to                     say a prayer for the conversion of that nation:                          <<  Draw  France  from  the  abyss  in  which  it  has  fallen,  give  it  Christian                     chiefs, who consecrate it again to your Sacred Heart... give it the faith: see that                     the first born of the Church may revive. “ He also invokes several French saints                     (Vol.  6,  page  53)  and  writes  another  prayer  to  the  Madonna  of  La  Salette  to                     achieve the same goal (Vol. 7, page 90).                          When  Pius  XI  addressed  an  exhortation  to  the  world  in  1926,  the  Father                     wrote a petition. The communities said it every evening before the Eucharistic                     blessing. The intentions were the following: 1. For the end of the persecution in                     Mexico; 2. For universal peace; 3. For the return of the dissident nations to the                     Church;  4.  For  the  holy  Church,  that  through  the  Pope  it  may  have  proper                     supremacy on the sacred sites of Palestine (Vol. 5, page 116). (4)","Very concerned with the life of the Church, in his last years he used to have                     on his desk the History of the Church by Balsamo, to read it in his free time. That                     reminds me another book. The Father was not skilled in the rules of liturgy, but                     he over-states when he says: “Very unsuited to rubrics and liturgy and always                     absent-minded, he was a pity while performing sacred services “ (S.C. Vol. 7,                     page 241). On the contrary, while saying mass, he excited devotion; but, because                     he was not inclined to rubrics, on the side of the History of the Church he also                     had the handbook of rubrics by Ugo Mioni.                          Resuming the topic of prayer, we let be known that the visits of the Father to                     the Pope were preceded by the servant of God's warm recommendations to his                     communities to pray for the success of his petitions.                          A personal petition to the child Jesus and to the bambinella Mary on January                     23, 1906, says:                          I am going to Rome, and hope to arrive with your blessing. May I be at the                     feet of the holy Father and perform something good for the consolation of your                     loving  hearts,  for  the  improvement  of  these  least  institutes,  and  for  the  works                     connected  with  them.  Please  bless,  guide,  and  support  me,  seeing  to  it  that                     everything succeed according to your will (Vol. 4, page 93).                              82                        10. Only asking for blessings                             In his relations with the Pope, the Father was only concerned with blessings.                     In the early times of the institute, directly or indirectly, he asked the Pope for                     some help, without receiving it. Writing to Father Cusmano, he said “My hope                     was deceived “ (S.C. Vol. 7, page 33). He never again appealed to the Pope for                     material help, not even when in serious need. Making reference to the period of                     1890-1900,  one  of  hard  financial  situation  for  the  institute,  Father  D'Agostino                     says, “He never asked the Pope for money, but for blessings. “","That has been the Father's policy all his life long. Father Drago relates that Don                     Orione revealed to Father Vitale Saint Pius X's amazement, because the Father                     never asked for financial help, but only for spiritual favors and blessings. Really,                     the Father used to say, “The Pope has to provide for all the world; therefore, we                     appeal to him only for spiritual favors. “                          After the 1908 earthquake, Pius X gave the Father a nice wooden church for                     Messina,  and  to  the  bishop  of  Oria  a  sum  of  money  to  help  the  Father's                     communities in Apulia, but the Father did not appeal to the Pope. Don Orione                     and Bishop Di Tommaso themselves did.                          The Father instead used to give his offering to the Pope. He introduced in his                     communities the custom of “saving the first earnings of some works every day. “                     In July, the saved amount was distributed to sacred services. The first amount                     was sent to the Pope, and the Father asked him to accept the humble offering and                     to  give  his  apostolic  blessing  “upon  our  wishes  and  hopes  “  (Vol.  28,  1).  He                     desired the Pope's blessing “as a gift of heaven, as a copious compensation for                     our humble work “ (Vol. 41, page 25).                          On  another  occasion,  the  Father  sent  his  offering  with  expressions  full  of                     love and faith:                                                                                                               83                         By saving some coins from the earning of their small works, (my orphans)                     gathered  25  liras.  They  lay  them  at  the  feet  of  Your  Holiness,  asking  you  to                     accept them benignly as a sign of our deep love and very humble submission and                     waiting for your generous, paternal, holy apostolic blessing. May this blessing of                     the Vicar of Christ descend upon us as the blessing of Isaac descended upon the                     head of Jacob! (March 3, 1899) Vol. 28, page 2).                          He entreated the Pope to pray, and how much the Father trusted in the prayer                     of the Pope ! Once, while under the weight of serious tribulation, he appealed to                     Leo  XIII,  who  assured  him  of  his  “prayer  to  the  Lord  to  free  him  from  the                     present tribulation through celestial grace” (Jan. 11, 1893). The Father quickly                     points out: “Immediately we experienced the effects of the Pope's prayer! “ The                     tribulation which seemed to threaten the institution with death disappeared, and                     everything ended in its favor (S.C. Vol. 10, page 212).                          In  1909,  he  informs  the  Pope  of  the  opening  of  a  house  in  Oria,  of  the                     sickness  afflicting  the  female  community,  and  implores:  “May  Your  Holiness                     give your paternal apostolic blessing to our entrance in this sacred place so that                     the Sacred Heart of","Jesus accept now and in the future our taking possession of it. May you also pray                     during the celebration of the mass, giving your blessing to these communities so                     that the Lord, despite my sins, have mercy on the sick and cure them according                     to his divine Heart through the intercession of his most holy Mother “ (Vol. 28,                     page 13). The same year he writes in the book of the divine benefits: “This year                     we  have  experienced  a  close  approach  to  the  Holy  Father  Pius  X  in  private                     audiences for me and the sisters. Blessing and help “ (S.C. Vol 10, page 242).                          Because things were going pretty well by God's help, the Father attributed the                     merit  to  the  Pope's  prayer,  saying:  “The  Pope's  words  are  true.  “  When  I                     complained  about  obstacles,  hardships,  sickness,  and  want  of  my  children,  he                     responded: “Be calm, Mr. Canon. Your work is of God, and the works of God go                     forth by themselves. “                        11. Candid like a child                                While expressing his love toward the Pope, the Father showed some                  84                     childish candor.                            When the mill was opened, he ordered to send the first paste to the Pope,                     as he did with the first earnings of the works.                          Once the year's crop of tangerines in Oria was abundantly blessed by God in                     quality,  size,  and taste. The  Father conceived the  idea  of sending  some to the                     Pope,  and  he  himself  manufactured  the  boxes  gracefully,  manifesting  to  the                     present community his smiling appreciation for the loving gift to the Holy Father                     and his candid, unreserved respect for him, which he always infused in us.                          A picture of Jesus, his hands tied up, and the wording: “But Jesus was silent,                     “  (Mt.  26,  63)  impressed  the  Father.  To  publicize  it,  he  had  many  varnished                     copies  printed  in  our  typography,  and  distributed  them  to  the  people,  bishops,                     and cardinals. He mailed","some  of  them  even  to  the  Pope,  to  whom  he  used  to  write  candidly  and                     confidently: “Your Holiness, we humbly beg your pardon and offer this precious                     picture of our adorable Savior before the tribunal; I had many copies printed to                     publicize it. I think that you appreciate it; therefore, I mail a box of them to Your                     Holiness “ (Vol. 28, page 19).                          During the second world war, after a real or supposed attack to the ferry in                     the strait of Messina, he asked the Pope to obtain from the emperor of Austria not                     to repeat such attempts (Vol. 32, page 50).                          When  Benedict  XV  invited  the  faithful  to  fast  severely  for  three  days  to                     implore peace, and he was the first to practice such a penance, the Father mailed                     a very touching petition on behalf of his communities begging His Holiness to                     spare himself from the fasting. With how much faith he did so!                          All the persons of my least institute, shedding tears, beg you to accept their                     humble, filial proposal to fast in your behalf because of your advancing age and                     the duties to govern the Church. By the help of the Lord, the orphans and the                     ruling stall' will perfectly observe the three severe fasts and three more in behalf                     of Your Holiness (May 29, 1915).                          His Holiness accepted the letter with supreme kindness, but he liked giving           85                     an authoritative example of prayer and fasting as well as an offering to God. The                     community, however, observed the six proposed fasts.                          The  Father  also  offered  his  life  for  the  Pope.  He  writes  to  Sister  M.                     Nazzarena  of  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  (July  8,  1919)  about  the  trouble,                     rather the revolution of the post-war-period: “Time presses terribly! It is worst                     than war! Socialism and anarchism are getting the upper hand! The government                     is  powerless,  and  no  one  knows  where  we  will  come  to  end!  Inform  the                     community about the perils; may they pray, fear God, and atone !... “ Then he                     continues: “Do not forget the Pope, our Holy Father Benedict XV. God forbid                     that they assault the Vatican ! Even though it is a far possibility, still the peril                     exists... Let us pray for the Holy Father, offering our life for the Pope's life! “                     (Vol. 35, page 217).                          Sister Vittoria reports that after the death of Benedict XV the Father gathered                     the community to announce the event. Eyes wet with tears, he told us to offer our                     prayers and sacrifices of several days for the repose of the Pope. In addition he                     ordered other prayers for the successor.","In  those  days  the  Father  bought  a  wooden  statue  of  the  child  Jesus  and                     exhibited it to the community for veneration. The child Jesus was presented as a                     pontiff  and  king  to  be  crowned  with  tiara  the  same  day  of  the  new  Pope's                     crowning in Rome, Sunday, February 12; 1922.                          The Father performed the liturgy of the coronation before the mass with the                     following formula:                          We  crown  you  as  eternal  pontiff,  king  of  heaven,  of  earth,  and  of  your                     Church. You are the invisible Pontiff supporting, illuminating, and guiding the                     visible Pontiff of Rome that has been elected as your Vicar, Pius XI.                              He entreats the eternal Father:                          For the sake of the child Jesus, defend more than ever your holy Catholic,                     apostolic,  Roman  Church;  protect,  defend,  enlighten,  and  guide  your  visible                     Vicar, the Roman reigning Pope Pius XI; infuse in him unusual intrepid faith,                     and  make  him  prevail  over  his  visible  and  invisible  enemies  (Vol.  9,  pages                     58-59). He repeated the same rite in Taormina on February 26, 1922.                                                                                                                 86                     12.  Above all, obedience                             to the Holy Mother Church                         The son of the Church is proved by his obeying its laws and by being faithful to                     its teaching. This was the habitual behavior of the Father in any event, and he                     recommended us to do the same.                          Let  us  listen  to  Father  Vitale  on  this  subject:  “Following  the  law  of  the                     Church  is  like  following  holy  obedience!  We  never  go  wrong.  First  of  all,                     obedience to the holy mother Church “ (Vol. 32, page 107).                         His letter of February 11, 1926, to Mrs. Zuccaro, who had","considered the Father inclined to accept the doctrine of theosophy, bears witness                     of his attachment to the Church. The immediate and vigorous action of the Father                     proves his deep feeling with the Church. He writes:                          I  protest  with  all  my  strength  that  I  was  never  inclined  to  that!  If  I  had                     accepted  this  wrong,  false  doctrine  for  a  moment,  I  would  have  committed  a                     serious sin, denying my Catholic faith, opposing the teaching of the holy Church,                     and the Apostle Paul saying: “And let me warn  you that if anyone preaches a                     version  of  the  Good  News  different  from  the  one  we  have  already  preached,                     whether it be ourselves or an angel from heaven, he is to be condemned” (Gal. 1,                     8).                          Theosophy is a false, fantastic doctrine, one of the heresies which appeared in                     the  world  since  the  beginning  of  the  Church,  failing  one  after  another...  It  is                     temerity  to  trust  in  this  queer  teaching,  whose  doctrine  and  books  oppose  the                     Church, and are forbidden by the Church!... Dear lady, please take my advice:                     burn these books, which are the results of insane minds far off from God and the                     truth; simply adhere to the Church's teaching.                          After reminding again the above quotation from Saint Paul, he continues:                          This  way  the  apostle  defends  the  revelation  of  Jesus  Christ  God-man,        87                     conveyed  to  us  by  the  Church.  Christ  said:  “If  he  refuses  to  listen  to  the                     community, treat him like a pagan or a tax collector” (Mt. 18, 17). Saint Paul                     teaches that the Church upholds the truth and keeps it safe! (1 Tim. 3, 15).                         But for you, my dear, the people far off from God, the insane minds teaching                     that the soul transfers from generation to generation, are the people who uphold                     the truth and keep it safe.                              He concludes:                          Dear  lady,  yield  to  the  holy  Church  and  adhere  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's                     revelation  upon  the  destiny  of  humankind  through  holy  Scripture,  the  Gospel,                     and the holy Church. You must know that the divine revelation cannot be added                     or deprived of something. The book of revelation of Saint John -ends the Old and                     the New Testament by saying: “This is my solemn warning to all who hear the                     prophesies in this book: if anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him                     every  plague  mentioned  in  the  book;  if  anyone  cuts  anything  out  of  the                     prophecies in this book, God will cut off his share in the tree of life and in the                     holy city “ (Rev. 22, 18-19).                         Now  I  have  to  humbly  pray  to  the  Sacred  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary  to                     illumine and help you in order to adhere to the teaching of the","Catholic faith, to the holy Church founded by Jesus Christ on the rock of papacy,                     which is the trustee of the evangelical truth.                         Postscript: “I dedicate a last thought to the over-wise of the reincarnation or                     theosophy, quoting from Scripture: \" Their deeds are corrupt and vile \" ! “ (Ps.                     13, 1) (Vol. 42, pages 16-18).                        13.  The value of the private revelations                                Now  we  touch  upon  a  very  important  issue  in  the  Father's  life:  his                     unreserved faithfulness to the Church about the apparition and the revelations at                     La Salette.                            First, let us see how the Father reacted to the private revelations on the                     whole.                             Some  persons  pointed  out  that  the  Father  was  somehow  inclined  to                     believe  in  private  revelations.  He  himself  declares  such  an  inclination,                     specifying, however, that he does not allow himself to be subdued: “I love the            88                     private revelations of holy persons, but I never accept everything “ (Vol. 37, page                     115).                             Father Vitale gives exact information on this subject:                             Very fond of mystics, as soon as he knew one was near, he approached the                     person endowed with supernatural gifts. He made connections with him/her; on                     occasion he was a guide, a counselor and/or a proofreader. Always well balanced                     in  faith,  he  discriminated  true  from  false  revelations  and  demanded  faith,  not                     private revelations as  a foundation  of action. Not to  make a false  step toward                     mistakes  or  danger,  he  liked  inner  virtues  best,  especially  obedience  (Father                     Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 280).                             Just now we have read the letter to Mrs. Zuccaro where the Father says                     that  the  apostles'  death  ended  the  revelation  in  the  Church.  He  also  explains:                     “The  revelation  is  the  one  Jesus  Christ  entrusted  to  the  Church  through  the                     apostles, which contains the","destiny of human beings. No new comer can change it at all “ (Vol. 42, 16).                             People  should not accept private revelations supinely. The Father  treats                     this subject in his letter of May 10, 1925, to Msgr. Liviero, bishop of Citta' di                     Castello. He criticizes the publication of Saint Veronica's entire diary:                             Being taught by the teaching of several mystics, I have always deemed                     that  the  visions  and  locutions  of  even  holy  persons,  especially  women,  may                     contain deceptions. Paulin attributes errors even to saints the Church venerates                     on the altars. How many contradictions we see between Saint Brigid, D'Agreda,                     Emmerich, etc. We cannot consider the revelations and the locutions as words of                     the Scripture. Some of them  must be omitted, and others explained in a right,                     prudent meaning (Vol. 29, page 82).                             The Father details these ideas in a letter to Father Peter Bergamaschi, who                     had  published  all  the  writings  of  a  renowned  Benedectine  mystic,  Sister  M.                     Cecilia  Baij  of  Montefiascone  (1694-1766).  The  Father  criticizes  such  a                     criterion:                             Conforming to prudence and sacred accuracy, people cannot deal with private                     revelations  as  if  they  were  canonical  books  or  decrees  of  the  Holy  See.  The  most                     enlightened  persons,  especially  women,  may  be  greatly  mistaken  in  the  visions,   89                     revelations,  locutions,  and  inspirations.  More  than  once  the  divine  operation  is                     restrained  by  human  nature.  For  instance,  who  could  ratify  in  full  all  the  visions  of                     Emmerich and Saint Brigid, (5) which show evident discrepancies ? I love very much                     the  private  revelations  of  holy  persons,  but  never  I  accept  them  in  full  !  Were  I  to                     publish  revelations,  I  would  eliminate,  or  revise  what  is  inconsistent  with  a  sound                     criterion,  or  reliable  traditions,  or  opinions  of  sacred,  learned  writers.  I  think  of                     behaving prudently...                            My dear father, to consider any expression of the private revelations as dogma                     or  proposition  near  the  faith  is  always  imprudent!  The  mistakes  could  amount  to                     thousands. Paulin substantiates this fact with the examples of saints we venerate on the                     altar. It is not surprising, because the vision or the news undergoes some modifications                     while  passing  through  human  channels.  Even  though  the  personal  dispositions  or                     aptitudes to receive the mystical operations may be habitual, the act of receiving such                     operations  is  actual.  The  same  dispositions  or  aptitudes  are  not  always  the  same;  a                     psychological, moral, spiritual, physical event                            can modify them, hindering the spiritual enlightenment from shining perfectly in                     the soul. Thus, the person is unaware of circumstances, details, or propositions, and is                     mistaken  involuntarily.  In  fact,  everything  is  received  through,  and  according  to  the                     subject.                            This is proved by experience, by the mystical theologians, such as Saint John of                     the cross, Saint Theresa, Castrovetere, Paulin, etc. by prudence and reason we cannot                     accept all the words (of the revelations)","as they were propositions near to the faith; still less when they are contrary to the                     authoritative opinion of renowned writers and to the simple, beneficial devotion                     of the saints (Vol. 37, pages 115-17).                             No  one  in  the  Father's  communities  was  allowed  to  adhere  to  private                     revelations, as to a rule. He writes to Msgr. Zimarino, bishop of Gravina:                             Mystical  theologians  teach  that  no  institution  must  be  taken  or  be                     approved  on  the  ground  of  private  revelations:  people  must  behave  as  though                     such revelations do not exist. I read that Saint Teresa asked her spiritual directors                     the  consent  to  found  an  institution,  but  she  concealed  the  revelations  which                     moved her to found it (S.C. Vol. 7, page 164).                             On  one  occasion,  to  reorganize  itself,  a  community  was  expecting  a                     revelation of a holy person, but the Father intervened:                             Do not provoke the Lord. We have faith, trust, counsel, reason, and prayer                     at our disposal; these are the means our Lord gave us to know his adorable will,                     or to follow it without gratifying our selfishness. Therefore, let us pray. Our Lord                     taught  us  how  effective  is  the  humble,  trustful,  perseverant  prayer  when  we                     surrender ourselves to the divine will with pure intention (Vol. 39, page 74).            90                        14. The apparitions at La Salette and Lourdes                                 Now we touch upon the Father's behavior on the issue of La Salette.                            The  apparition  of  the  Madonna  at  La  Salette  on  September  19,  1846,                     touched the world for a period of time. Several authors elucidated it with their                     writings, sacred preachers spread it from the pulpit, and the new devotion was                     introduced  in  cities  and  countries.  But,  while  the  devotion  to  the  Madonna  of                     Lourdes  was  increasing,  the  Holy  See  intervened  with  two  decrees  to  remove                     some abuses introduced in the devotion","to Our Lady of La Salette; consequently, the devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes                     kept  increasing  while  the  devotion  to  Our  Lady  of  La  Salette  decreased.                     Furthermore, several people considered the devotion almost prohibited, whereas                     the decrees meant to put the devotion in the right terms.                             The diocesan authority has recognized the two apparitions.                             After a rigorous canonical process that examined the events, the persons                     involved, and the miracles, Msgr. Lawrence, bishop of Tarbes, declared:                             We judge that Immaculate Mary, Mother of God, has really appeared to                     Bernardette Soubirous on February 11, 1858, and in the following days, 18 times,                     in  the  Massabielle  cave  on  the  outskirts  of  Lourdes.  This  apparition  has  the                     characters of the truth; therefore, the faithful can surely believe in it (Trochou,                     Saint Bernardette Soubirous, Marietti, Turin, pages 326-27).                             Likewise,  the  bishop  of  Grenoble  recognized  the  events  at  La  Salette.                     After a regular process of five years, Bishop Philibert de Bruillard declared on                     September 19, 1851:                             We judge that the apparition of the most holy Virgin to two shepherds on                     September 19, 1846, on a mount of the Alps' mountain chain, within the territory          91                     of La Salette parish of Corps deanery, has the characters of the truth; therefore,                     the faithful can surely believe in it (Barbero, La Salette, Pauline editions, page                     229).                             Pius XII referred to this document when he wrote the letter to the superior                     general of La Salette Missionaries on October 8, 1945, for the first centenary of                     the  apparition.  He  said:  “The  canonical  process  of  the  diocesan  authority                     ended  positively  “  (The  Marian  teaching  of  Pius  Xll,  Pauline  editions,  page                     141).                             To fully understand what we are going to say, we need to keep in mind the                     policy of the Holy See with regard to the two apparitions. In 1877, three bishops                     questioned  the  S.  Congregation  of  Rites  on  this  subject,  and  they  were  told:                     “Those apparitions or revelations have been neither condemned nor approved by                     the Holy See, who has permitted the faithful to believe them only with human                     faith, on the ground of the traditions referring them, substantiated by the proofs                     and the trustworthy witnesses... Therefore, the Holy See gave neither approval                     nor condemnation, but has showed a permissive attitude. Thirty years after, the                     above quotation of Pius XII was inserted in the encyclical of Pius X against the                     Modernism  “  (Volken.  The  Revelation  in  the  Church,  Pauline  editions,  page                     203).","15.  Why is La Salette in the twilight ?                                 Why does Lourdes flash new gleams while La Salette seems to fall into                     oblivion ?                            Father Volken (Ibid. page 115) says, “A particular revelation is open to                     criticism by itself; however, if it is destined to edify the Church, it will reach its                     goal at the time destined by God. “ He substantiates his statement with the devo-                     tion  to  the  Sacred  Heart.  “Saint  Margaret  died  in  1690,  but  the  events  of                     Parey-le-Monial and the devotion to the Sacred Heart were acknowledged in full                     200  years  after  Margaret's  death.  The  devotion  to  the  Sacred  Heart  by  Father                     John Croiset, S. J., was published in 1691, but it was put in the Index Librorum;                     it was taken away from the Index in 1887. “                             We wish and are praying that the devotion to Our Lady of La Salette may                     triumph; meanwhile we listen to our Padre saying the motives that hindered the                     course of this devotion.                             He  attributes  the  fact  to  “the  enemy  of  any  good,  who  raised  fanatical                     defenders  of  the  apparition,  who  backed  some  supporters,  in  good  faith          92                     pretending to, impose the apparition of the most holy Virgin and her words as a                     dogma,  before  the  Holy  Church  expressed  its  serene  and  wise  judgment;                     furthermore, they offended the ecclesiastical authority. The books they published                     were put in the Index Librorum. The French clergy felt offended and reacted with                     the press, to the prejudice of the apparition. “ It was during these events that the                     quoted  decrees  were  promulgated.  “The  enemies  seized  the  opportunity  to                     discredit the apparition; the supporters became more fanatical and boisterous.                             As  a  consequence,  many  people  thought  that  the  holy  Church  had                     prohibited the devotion to Our Lady of La Salette (which never happened), and                     their  enthusiasm  cooled  down.  Meanwhile,  the  apparition  of  Our  Lady  in                     Lourdes was renowned, and the people moved forward in that devotion, whereas","the devotion of la Salette decreased everywhere, except in the holy mountain “                     (S.C., Vol. 1, page 188). (6)                         16.  A book by abbot Combe is condemned                                The Father found himself involved in the question of la Salette because of                     the  little  shepherd  Melanie,  sister  of  Massimino,  to  whom  the  Virgin  had                     appeared.                            In 1897, at the age of 66, she was in Messina for one year as a directress                     of the Daughters of Divine Zeal, when their institute was on the verge of death.                             Whatever people may say of this yet debated woman, the Father thought                     of her intervention in the institute as of “an unexpected blessing from God, an                     unforgettable fortune.” The year of her government regenerated the community                     to  such  a  degree  that  the  Father  said:  “She  laid  the  foundation  of  the  humble                     institute of the Daughters of Divine Zeal “ (Vol. 45, page 444).                             Therefore it is no wonder that the Father admired her uncommon virtues             93                     and  nourished  a  deep  feeling  of  gratitude  as  to  hold  her  as  a  co-founder.  In                     December 1905, on the first anniversary of her death in Altamura, he went there                     to the cathedral with a group of sisters and gave the funeral oration. His speech                     was published.                             In 1907 the Sacred Congregation  of the Index happened to prohibit the                     reading of a book by Abbot Gilbert Joseph Combe who had translated the funeral                     oration of the Father on Melanie into French language and had inserted it in his                     book.                             This event made the Father so grieved that he quickly wrote to the Sacred                     Congregation, protesting his perfect obedience to the orders of the holy Church.                     We quote his declaration.                         Messina, May 31, 1907                      Your  Eminence  Cardinal  Prefect,  Eminences  Cardinals  and  Excellences                     Consulters of the Sacred Congregation of the Index:                              It has come to my knowledge that the Sacred Congregation of the","Index has prohibited the reading of the book published in Paris,  The Secret of                     Melanie,  the  Little  Shepherd  of  la  Salette,  and  the  Present  Crisis,  by  Abbot                     Gilbert Combe, pastor of Diou (Allier).                             Because  my  funeral  oration  on  the  little  shepherd  of  La  Salette  at                     Altamura has been inserted on pages 21-36 of that book, I feel obliged to declare                     the  following  statement  to  Your  Eminences  and  to  the  Eminent  Consultors:  if                     you have found in that oration any reason for prohibiting the book, besides those                     found  in  the  same  book,  I  perfectly  conform  to  the  upright  judgment  of  the                     Church expressed by this Sacred Congregation, and I retract everything of the                     funeral oration which might have caused the prohibition.                             As  to  the  apparition  of  the  most  holy  Virgin  of  la  Salette  and  to  the                     marvelous  deeds  that  people  attribute  to  the  late  Melanie  Calvat,  I  give  only                     human  credence  according  to  the  mind  of  Pope  Urban  VIII,  being  ready  to                     forbear  from  it  if  the  judgment  of  the  holy  Church  and  of  His  Holiness  is                     contrary to such a credence.                             Humbly kissing the hands of Your Eminences and Excellences, I declare                     myself                                                           your humble servant,                                 94                                                        Canon Hannibal Mary Di Francia                     (Vol. 28, page 52)                             The Sacred Congregation did not answer the above protestation, and the                     theologians censors found no fault in that oration, for they affirm that the book                     by  Combe  was  condemned  for  different  reasons.  In  fact,  the  Father  was  not                     compelled to retract or correct anything, as he should have done if some fault                     were found in his funeral oration.                       17. A letter to Abbot Combe                                0n August 15 of the same year, the Father mailed to Abbot Combe a                     copy of his protestation and a letter, which is a monument to his ecclesiastical                     spirit.                            First,  he  exhorts  the  abbot  to  accept  the  condemnation  of  his  book                     deservedly:","My dearest brother, you know that we have to accept everything from the hands                     of God  with  great  humility, acknowledging that everything  comes  for our  good. We                     always  deserve  being  mortified  by  his  divine  hand.  But,  when  contradictions  or                     admonitions  come  from  highest  ecclesiastical  authorities,  such  as  the  Sacred  Roman                     Congregations  that  represent  the  Pope,  then  our  submission  must  be  perfect,  our                     humility  deep,  and  our  prudence  holy.  In  such  a  case,  we  must  not  consider  the                     circumstances which caused the admonition or contradiction  from  the prelates  of the                     holy Church. God makes use of several means, but the decisions of the high prelates of                     the holy Church are work of the Holy Spirit, who governs the Church. We must heartily                     reprove what the Church reproves, even by renouncing our judgment. If God himself                     wants to change things,  he will do so at the proper time and place. But, the less we                     submit to those who represent him, the less he will change things.                          The Father seized the opportunity to expound the sound principles to which                     the defenders of La Salette should adhere.                             My dearest brother in Jesus Christ, I cannot help submitting to you some ideas                     of mine about the mistakes in which people fall while they defend La Salette, to the                     prejudice of the holy cause.                             From several apologies about La Salette and from several persons I have dealt                     with, I have noticed that when they defend the apparition of the most holy Virgin, the                     secret,  and  the  Rule  of  the  Apostles  of  the  Last  Times,  their  way  of  acting  is  not   95                     according to prudence, caution, and charity.                             These are the errors in which they usually fall:                             1. They put on the same plane both the apparition of the most holy Virgin and                     the  dogmas  of  the  holy  Church,  whereas  the  marvelous  events  are  nothing  else  but                     private credences. People believe in them with humble, simple faith according to the                     reasons for believing, but they should not put them on the same plane of the dogmas.                             2.  They  put  the  secret  on  the  same  plane  of  the  gospel.  The  criterion  for                     accepting such revelations should be very different from the criterion through which we                     accept  the  gospel  as word of  God. Private revelations  are subject to  errors owing to                     human beings who receive such revelations, by permission of God.                             That the defenders of La Salette think of the apparition as a dogma or a gospel                     of secret cannot be approved. Because error calls upon error, they become enflamed and                     excited while defending La Salette and the secret, and pretend that all should believe;                     they almost cry out for lightning from heaven to strike down those who do not believe,                     as some disciples did with Jesus for the people who did not receive him. “And yet, the                     Lord turned toward them only to reprimand them “ (Lk. 9, 55).                             My humble opinion is that the apologies for La Salette and the secret went too                     far, to the prejudice of these divine events, letting the devil make a gain.","But  the  enemy  of  any  good  made  the  best  gain  when  he  pushed  the                     defenders of La Salette and the secret beyond the limits of defense, offending the                     ecclesiastical  authority,  to  a  great  prejudice  of  the  Lord's  works.  All  this                     displeases the Lord.                             According to the teaching of sound theology, what God works in private                     in the Church must be submitted to the judgment and will of those who represent                     him. God is jealous of this order he established, and wants no one to alter this                     rule  of  faith.  When  people  deal  with  high  personalities  of  the  holy  Church  to                     make them accept private revelations or works, they must act with great humility                     and submission to the Church's authority. They must act humbly and prudently to                     gain their assent and the approbation of the ecclesiastical authorities. The saints                     did so, their private great revelations notwithstanding.                             Without  such  humility  and  prudence,  the  defense  of  the  truth  becomes                     fanaticism! (S.C. Vol. 8, page 61).                             This is the doctrine of the Second Vatican Council about the charismas:                     “Those  who  have  charge  over  the  Church  should  judge  the  genuineness  and                     proper use of these gifts, through their office not indeed to extinguish the Spirit,                     but to test all things and hold fast to what is good “ (L.G. 12).                                                                                                               96                       18. ... and to Leon Bloy                                The  Father  presents  the  same  remarks  to  the  famous  Leon  Bloy                     (1846-1917).                            Also the apocalyptic French writer concerned himself with La Salette and                     published  his  volume  Celle  qui  pleure.  He  sent  a  copy  to  the  Father,  perhaps                     following a suggestion from Combe. The book shows traces of the disputes of                     those times, and, above all, of the author's intolerance.                            The Father writes to him on September 18, 1918, acknowledges receipt of                     the  work,  and  “like  a  friend  and  admirer  “  submits  his  remarks  to  him.  Very                     important is the first one:","Writing and printing invectives and offensive words against the bishops,                     who are united with God, endowed with the fullness of priesthood and with a                     very high dignity, cannot be approved. If some of them do not comply with their                     duty, it is out of our business to judge and condemn them. They depend on the                     Roman Pontiff; who will take care of them.                             Then he insists:                             I think that the passionately fond of La Salette and Melanie used a wrong                     system to defend and to credit the apparition; their system instead discredited the                     apparition and Melanie. What benefit can la Salette derive from laying the blame                     on the ecclesiastical authority and from discrediting the French bishops ?                             Besides,  your  whole  publication  is  illegitimate  for  lack  of  the  eccle-                     siastical  imprimatur.  Nor  can  one  say  that  the  imprimatur  was  unnecessary;  it                     was indispensable for your book! If the Roman Curia gives some weight to your                     book, it will put it in the Index, as it happened to other publications on Melanie                     and La Salette. I question the authors of these works: are the books worthy of the                     index  librorum  the  best  means  to  credit  Melanie  and  La  Salette  ?  A  French                     proverb says “Surtout pas trop de zel ! “                             The Father concludes with a proposal worthy of his love for Our Lady and           97                     the Church:                             Highly esteemed Mr. Bloy, I beg you a favor in the name of the most holy                     Virgin of La Salette, in the name of Melanie: withdraw all the copies of your                     book and mail them to me; if they are all, I will buy and destroy them; later, you                     will correct and publish them with the curia's imprimatur (S.C. Vol. 8, page 80).                             Leon Bloy, however, did nothing; on the contrary, he said that if his book                     were put in the Index, that would be the best advertisement. The Father writes to                     Combe:                             I want to forget to have read this phrase unworthy of a Catholic; I think it                     just  escaped  your  lips  when  you  were  thoughtless;  therefore,  you  deserve  our                     pity. I too, in a moment, could do worse! S.C. Vol. 8, page 64).","19. For Melanie's biography                                 The  remembrance  of  Melanie  is  connected  with  the  apparition  at  La                     Salette.  The  Father  held  her  as  a  soul  of  great  virtues,  perhaps  worthy  of  the                     honor on the altar, but having some defects to which he hints here and there in                     his  writings.  When  Abbot  Combe  resolved  to  write  her  biography,  the  Father                     congratulated  him  on  his  resolve,  but  warned  him  in  order  to  avoid  another                     condemnation.                             If you want this publication to achieve the goal we all wish, you have to                     develop the work in such a way as to avoid another prohibition from the Sacred                     Congregation of the Index.                             A style and a language of great moderation, reserve, limitless respect, and                     submission  to  the  prelates  of  the  holy  Church  should  predominate  in  your                     publication. No word should offend priests or journalists, detractors or opposers                     of La Salette. Let the critics of the future value these events. Now, the state of                     things,  prudence,  charity,  the  satisfaction  for  the  offended  ecclesiastical                     authority,  as  well  as  the  need  to  destroy  any  mark  of  fanaticism  in  this  story   98                     require a very great caution. History is to vindicate some deeds. By publishing                     Melanie's biography, we must take the only care of expounding the great holiness                     of that soul, her inner, continuous communication with God, her extraordinary                     virtues, her suffering, and the gifts she received from God.                             At last, he ended his writing with a stupendous conclusion:                             The judgment of the  Church excepted, in which I believe  more than in                     what I have seen with my eyes and in what I have touched with my hands (S.C.                     Vol. 8, page 63).                             This  profession  of  faith  is  enough  to  measure  the  Father's  total,                     unconditioned faithfulness to the holy Church. (7)","20.  Protestation of faithfulness to the Pope                                 We  conclude  this  chapter  by  quoting  the  following  protestation  to  the                     Pope that the Father wrote for the Rogationists:                             As  a  Christian  by  Lord's  mercy,  as  a  priest  unworthy  of  the  Catholic                     Church, and as a congregant of an institute aiming primarily at increasing the                     priests, I declare that I will have the greatest respect, an unlimited subjection, and                     subordination to the Holy Father. I will hold, love, and obey him as our Lord                     Jesus Christ up to my last breath: The Holy Father's interests will be my heart's                     living  interests;  his  words,  either  said  outside  cathedra  or  privately,  will  be                     oracles of eternal salvation for me. His opinions and ways of thinking will be the                     rule of my opinions and the ways of my thinking, to which I will always conform                     myself. His sorrows and pains will be mine.                             When I preach, confess, and talk I will instill in the people these feelings                     of  unlimited  subjection  and  filial  love  toward  Jesus  Christ's  Vicar.  The  first                     intention  I  will  put  in  the  mass,  thanksgiving,  divine  office,  meditation,  and                     rosary  will  be  for  the  Holy  Father  along  with  his  intentions.  When  he  issues   99                     encyclicals or delivers speeches and I am fortunate to read them, I will conform                     myself  to  his  feelings  obeying  exactly  what  he  commands  or  suggests.  I  will                     consider the Holy Father as sacred and venerable, and if I am fortunate enough to                     see him, I will repute the opportunity of kissing his feet and even the dust on                     which his feet trample as my fortune.                             I have declared all this for the following reasons:                             1. Because I know that our Lord Jesus Christ wants us to honor, love, and                     obey his Vicar as his own person.                             2.  Because  the  predominant  spirit  and  the  rule  of  this  humble  institute                     command it.                             3. Because I feel profoundly and intimately that such things must be.                             4.  Because  the  perfect  subjection  to  the  Holy  Father  brings  about  the                     Lord's blessing on each institute and each soul, whereas a lack of this subjection                     under the pretext of these distinctions ex cathedra and","3. SON OF THE CHURCH                      not ex cathedra, person and sacred character is the beginning of serious faults for                     the  individuals  and  the  beginning  of  ruin  for  the  communities  (Vol.  44,  page                     123).                             This  splendid  declaration,  transcribed  on  an  artistic  parchment  was                     handled  in  the  hands  of  Pope  Paul  VI  by  the  superior  general  in  the  private                     audience given to our capitular Fathers on September 14, 1968. On the following                     October  1,  Msgr.  Giovanni  Benelli,  substitute  for  the  State  Secretariat,                     communicated His Holiness' satisfaction for the filial homage, adding:                             While  reading  the  document,  the  Holy  Father  has  been  touched  by  the                     fervent expressions of deep faith in the Pope's mission, the sincere love toward                     the  Person  who  carries  the  burden  and  the  responsibility,  and  the  complete                     adhesion to the teaching and the directives of the Pontifical Magisterium... Sure                     that  the  feelings  of  the  venerable  Founder  continue  to  be  a  stimulus  and  a                     program for the members of the two Congregations instituted by him, the Holy                     Father wishes that this exemplar attachment to the Cathedra of Peter be rewarded                     with copious celestial favors and be a source of merits and happy increase.                                                                                                                 100                          Notes                       (1) The Father makes use of the word adoration in a very large meaning. He points out                        one's own submission, out of “inner feeling of respectful love toward the beloved                        object... Hence it is easy to explain the ecclesiastical custom to genuflect before the                        Pope, the diocesan bishop, as well as to kiss the Pope's foot, The term adoration also                        explains the act of respect and veneration that the cardinals give the neo-elect Vicar                        of Christ “ (Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 1. adoration, columns 320 and 323).                      (2) The battery which opened fire against Porta Pia on September 20, 1870, was                        commanded  by  Second-lieutenant  Carlo  Almirante,  a  young  engineer  from                        Catanzaro. Later he was ordained a priest, lived 86 years, and at his death in 1934                        Naples  mourned  over  him  because  of  his  extraordinary  virtues.  The  Sacred                        Congregation  for  the  canonizations  is  concerned  with  his  beatification.  Jokes  of                        Providence! (Msgr. Canestri, L'anima di Pio IX, vol. 3, page 283).","(3) We have developed the Father's opinion on Carducci in our Bulletin of 1967, pages                        236-67 and 376-77).                      (4) Keep  in  mind  that  in  those  times  the  state  of  Israel  was  not  yet  born,  and  the                        condition of the holy land was precarious.                      (5) Because of the precarious condition of the Church in those times, Saint Brigid in her                        revelations announces a catastrophic future; but a biographer remarks:                         As it happens to the souls who are zealous for the Lord's cause, or for the cause                        they think is the Lord's, Brigid mistakes her voice for God's voice “ (G. Joergensen,                        Saint Brigid of Vadstena, vol. 2, page 187).                      (6) Now  the  renewal  of  the  devotion  is  increasing:  “Even  though  the  hospice  of  the                        sanctuary of La Salette, the highest in Europe, has almost doubled its pilgrim rooms,                        it has been always ` full house ' during summer time. Besides the private Pullmans                        and the lines of cars, about 25-30 daily bus of line climbed along the winding roads                        of the fascinating mountain up to La Salette. The ample parking lots were hardly                        sufficient. But in the days immediately previous to September 19, anniversary of the                        apparition, a comforting great number of confessions and Communions put to a hard                        test the zealous missionaries of La Salette, who were helped by numerous brethren                        who  on  purpose  had  come  from  Italy,  Swiss,  Germany,  Belgium,  Spain  “                        (L'Osservatore Romano, September 29, 1971, page 6).                      (7) Combe did not write the biography of Melanie; Leon Bloy published The Life of         101                        Melanie, which is made of the Melanie's notes about her adolescence (1831-1846).                        Unfortunately, we do not have yet a biography on documentary evidence; therefore,                        Melanie remains a variously discussed figure.","102","4.

He was born for that                                     Now  we are entering the field in which the Father  gathered his  best                     laurels:  the Rogate.  He himself acknowledges such  a merit  in  a phrase of his                     own  funeral  oration,  which  somehow escaped  from his pen,  and he attenuated                     soon after:  \"About the ROGATE we say this only: he devoted himself to this                     prayer either for zeal or out of obsession or both\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 24l).                                 History  assures  that  he  was  very  zealous,  and  the  censors  of  his                     writings  have already acknowledged that.  One of  them  has stated  alluringly:                     \"The  Servant of God was so touched  by  the needs  of  the  Church due to the                     lack  of    workers,    and    by    the  effectiveness  of  the  remedy  suggested  by  the                     gospel that to carry out  such  a remedy,  which is the prayer,  he moved  heaven                     and earth.  This  topic  was the reason of his  life,  the  prevalent motive of his                     writings, the characteristic of his institute.\" This  statement  reminds me of the                     words I wrote  long  ago: \"The  Rogate  was  the light of his way,  the  star  of         104                     his  thought,    the    sun  of  his  life:    he  was  born  for  the    Rogate.    We  cannot                     imagine  our  Father but waving the shining flag  of  the Rogate,  and  longing to                     bring it all over the world.\"  \"Ah !\"  he exclaimed,   \"we  pray  for  the  rain,  the                     good  harvest,  the liberation from divine punishments,  and for so many human                     needs, but  we  leave  out praying to God that he send  out  evangelical workers                     to his mystical harvest.\"  In a fervent prayer   to  the Sacred Heart, he wails:                                  Why don't your sacred lovers lift up this prayer to you? Why doesn't                     the Catholic world get up as one man to implore plenty of priests  from  your                     divine heart,  while the souls perish?   Lord, spread  this spirit of prayer from east                     to west,  from  south  to north.  May the hearts of the high prelates,  of your                     bishops, of the priests, of the whole Church overflow with it. May the hearts of                     the  virgins and the sisters consecrated to you  be  enflamed with  it.  Lord  Jesus,                     we    ask  the  triumph  of    the    Evangelical  Rogation  of  your  heart  all  over  the                     Church and the world. Make it a universal rogation.  May all people fulfill this                     divine  desire of your heart;","may  their  ears  be  penetrated  by  the  lasting  cry  of  your    longing  heart:    \"The                     harvest is great,  but the workers are few:  pray,  therefore,  to the owner of the                     harvest that he send out  workers to his harvest!\" Here is the Father's enflamed                     soul ! These words come out of his bones permeated by heavenly fire,  as the                     prophet Jeremiah said,  \"From on high he sent fire down  into my very frame\"                     (Lam.  l,  l3).  (The priesthood, letter circular, page 43).                             This is the Father's charisma.                            The  Second  Vatican  Council has recalled the  doctrine  of Saint  Paul                     about the charismas:  \"It is one and the same  Spirit who  produces  all these                     gifts,    distributing  them  to  each  as    he  wills\"  (l.    Cor.    l2,    11).    \"He  also                     distributes special  graces among  the faithful of every rank.  By these gifts he                     makes    them  fit    and    ready    to  undertake  various  tasks  and  offices    for    the                     renewal  and  building up of  the  Church\"  (L.G.  no.  l2).  The Father's  charisma                     was  the understanding and the zeal  for  the Rogate,  which are the base of his                     works.  It will appear clearly from the present and the following chapter.(l)                       2. The hour of  Providence                                                                                                                  105                            We admire the Providence's intervention at its proper time.                             To  face  the  needs  of  the  Church,    God  sends  his  servants  for  specific                     missions  in  time and place established by him.                             The   founders   of  orders  and  religious   congregations, beginning with                     Saint  Benedict  up  to  the  great  souls  who  in  modern  times  have  adorned  the                     Church with marvelous institutes, arose to meet  the  needs of their time.  God                     raised the Father  when  the Church in Italy was having troubles for the clergy's                     condition.                             The revolution of the liberals,  socialists,  and masons had already pushed                     many  priests  astray,    had  suppressed  the  religious  communities,    had                     impoverished the dioceses and the  seminaries, and  had spread into the classes of                     society,    the    common    people  included,    the    secular  spirit  of  religious                     indifference.  Such a spirit","was often combined with the spirit of an open  scorn  and persecution  to the                     Church,    the  Pope,    and  everything  related  to  religious  life.  We  cannot  help                     reminding the insult to the corpse of  Pope  Pius IX on the night of  July  l3,  l88l,                     while  being transferred from the Vatican to Verano.                            Above   all,   the   worldly   way   of   disobedience   and licentiousness                     had penetrated the clergy, whose desertion reached the  20%  in some regions of                     south Italy;  but the  disorder  had already  invested all the nation.  In l87l,  when                     Msgr.  Bonomelli  took    possession  of  the  diocese  of  Cremona  (population                     350.000), he mourned over the apostacy of 35 priests.  Msgr.  Corti, bishop of                     Mantova, died all of a sudden of a broken heart because of the apostacy  of  his                     clergy,   several  teachers  of  the  seminary included.                            In    Sicily,      the    ecclesiastical    battalion,    also      called  sacrilegious                     battalion,  was  formed  by  priests  and  friars.  Most  of  them  deserted  the  divine                     service when Msgr. Cirino Rinaldi, Judge of Royal Monarchy, mailed a circular,                     inviting  the  ecclesiastical  superiors    of    Sicily    to    give  their  subjects    full                     freedom  of enlisting Garibaldi's army.                            “A    very    awkward  situation  reigned  in  the  diocese  of    Lecce  and                     Messina,  where  serious moral  disorders  were  established because  of  the                     Ordinaries' old age.>> Writing to the  king  of Naples  on  Oct.  2,  l857,  Pius IX                     regretted  for    the    \"serious  disorders    in  the  diocese  of  Messina,    due  to  the                     cardinal's  old unaptness  and  his  present  imbecility\"  (Aubert,    Pius  IX's         106                     Pontificate,  appendix  by P.  Martina,  page 673).  In  Historic Events of Messina                     Seminary,    page  26,  Msgr.  Minutoli  re-establish  the  good  name  of  Cardinal                     Villadicani,  archbishop  of  Messina;  for  sure  he  had  positive  merits  (Oliva,                     Annali di Messina,  vol.  8, pages 358-59),  but he was a simple man without the                     nerve to rule discipline in those stormy times;  furthermore,  he was also weak                     because of age,  and the ill-intentioned persons took  advantage.  Hence,   the                     regret  of  Pius  IX,   who  sent  an  apostolic administrator.  When  the  Father                     had the  funeral  oration  upon Cardinal  Guarino,  he soberly touched upon the                     condition of  the diocese  of  Messina in l875,   when the archbishop took  up  the                     office: \" While singing the praise of Guarino, God forbid me from  putting  his                     predecessors  of happy and blessed  memory  in  the shade.  But  the  period                     from  l860 up to us  has  been  one  of exceptional  torments to the Church of                     God  !  We  have  witnessed  the  desolation    of    the    kingdom  of  God  and  the                     abomination  of  his house,  mentioned by the seer of Babylon.  As","soon as  Archbishop Guarino arrived, with a quick glance and by intuition he                     knew  and  savored    the  miserable  condition  of  our  diocese\"  (Vol.    45,    page                     30).(2)                              More  or  less  pitiable  was the  condition  of  the  other dioceses in                     Italy,  which  was  ominously  reflected  in  the  shortage  of  religious  and                     ecclesiastical vocations.  The statistical  data for  the diocesan and regular clergy                     during the Father's life are the following: in l86l, the priests were ll8,488 for a                     population of 2l,777,334;  in l92l, the priests were 62,942 for a population  of                     38,033.000. Anemia had entered the body of the Church; to give it freshness and                     vigor,    new  lymph  should  run  in  its  veins.    But,  because    the  splendor  of  the                     Church is usually connected  to  its priesthood,  a  means  to raise numerous and                     holy priests in  the Church was to be found.                            The  priest  is  a divine man that  no  human  industry  can create,  and                     Christ  himself took the care of pointing  out  the prayer as the proper means to                     obtain  them.    He  said,  \"Pray  to  the  owner    of    the  harvest  that  he  send  out                     workers to gather in  his harvest.\"                                 To make this means known,  adopted,  and esteemed,  God sent our                     Father to the Church as an apostle of this prayer: Rogate.                        3. The Rogationist Vocation                                                               107                                When  and  how  was  the Father called  to  the  Rogationist vocation?                            Referring    to  Rogate,    he  confesses  that  \"the  Lord,    by    his  infinite                     goodness,  enlightened  him about a great word  of  the gospel,  which contains                     the secret of the Church's and  society's salvation\"  (Vol.  38,  page ll).  Under an                     anonymous  veil,  the Father  relates  the  action  of the grace  which  connected                     his thought  and heart to the evangelical word:                             \"There    was    a  person  who  paid    specific  attention    to    this  divine                     command  before  he  read  it  in  the  gospel,    and    began    his  career  with  this                     attention\"  (Precious Adhesions, l9l9, page l0). Such an attention was due to a                     divine inspiration in the bloom of his youth:  it was \"a great, sublime idea that the                     spirit of God, who   blows wherever he wishes it to,  inspired to a young man in","the  beginning  of  his spiritual youth,  many  years  before  he started the Pious                     Institution\" (Ibid. page 7).                             Let  us  read  an additional  anonymous  confession  of  the Father:                             At  the beginning of his spiritual life and  before  knowing these divine                     words of Jesus:  \"Pray,  therefore,  to the owner of the  harvest  that  he  will send                     out  workers  to    gather    in    his  harvest,\"    a    youth  was  immersed  in  the                     predominant    thought    of  increasing    chosen  priests,    holy  and  apostolic  men                     according  to the Heart of Jesus by winning them from God through an  insistent                     prayer.  He  felt that such a prayer was the best means to work a greater  good  in                     the holy Church,  to save many  souls,  and  to expand the kingdom of God on                     earth as it happened in the times of Saint Dominic,  Saint Francis,  Saint Ignatius,                     Saint Alphonsus, etc.                            For this youth, this idea was clear and unquestionable.                            Later  he was amazed and absorbed after reading these divine words in the                     gospel:  \"There is a large harvest,  but few workers to  gather it in.  Pray to the                     owner of the harvest that he  will send out workers to gather in his harvest\" (Mt.                     9, 37). (Vol. 2, page l43)                             Father Vitale has:                                                                                                               108                            Perhaps  before  taking the cassock,  in the fervor  of  his prayer at the foot                     of the Blessed Sacrament,  Mary Hannibal  felt that  one  of the most important                     issues he could address  to  the Lord  concerning the saving of souls was to ask                     him to bring holy priests into his Church. He searched for an appropriate prayer                     in books  but he did not succeed in finding any that  expressed  his sentiments.                     From    that  time  on,    he  always  kept  in  mind  that  the  Church    needed    such                     prayer.  Later,  when he  came  across  the following gospel, he heard a voice                     inside him telling him to make himself  an apostle and a propagator of this prayer                     (Ibid.  page 42).                             The  last assertion is unlike the Father's  declaration:  he heard  the voice                     before he knew the word of the gospel and before he  took  the cassock.  He                     already used to visit  every  day    the Blessed  Sacrament  exposed  for the 40                     hours in  shifts  in  the churches of the city,  and he told us that one day, in a visit                     to Saint   John   of  Malta's  church,(3)  he  received  the   first inspiration  to                     consecrate  himself  to  the  prayer    for    obtaining  priests,  still  ignoring  the                     evangelical command.                            We recall additional thoughts of the Father on the origin of his Rogationist                     vocation.  He told us that he was very grieved by                      the desertion of priests and friars because of the revolution  of that  time;  on  the","other  hand,  holiness seemed  to  him  too transcendental,  and  he admired the                     great heroism of the  saints while  studying  the  frescos  in  the  churches  and                     convents, especially in Porto Salvo's.  To make piety bloom in those times, he                     thought that prayer was the only means,  and he wrote some of them to obtain                     holy  priests.    One  day  he  read  in  the  gospel  about  the    Rogate,    and  he  was                     surprised that none of the prayer  books pointed it out; therefore, he felt himself                     drawn to cultivate the evangelical rogation.                        4. The First Writing on the Rogate                               As  the  sun does on earth  in its  rising,  so  the  divine Rogate  began                     illuminating  the  Father's  mind  when  he  was  still    a  cleric,    characterizing  his                     spiritual life.   However,  we do not have  any vocation prayer of that time by the                     Father.    His    first  prayers    for    vocations  date  back  to  his  early  work  in                     Avignone. Yet,  we are convinced that the anonymous article \"An  Invitation to                     Prayer,\" on The Catholic Word of March l3,  l875, addressed to the  citizens  of                     Messina expecting  the  new  archbishop  after Msgr.  Natoli's death,  is by the                     Father. As a matter of fact, it contains  thoughts  and  phrases  in tune  with  his                     spirit  and mentality.                                                                    109                            After  quoting  the divine command,  he  continues:                            \"If we hasten to ask the Lord for the rain, all the more  we must  pray  for                     help through the care of a  shepherd  of  divine wisdom.\"                            He    exhorts    the    faithful  to  implore  from  Our  Lady    of    the  Letter  a                     learned,  holy archbishop,  a wise,  prudent, and strong man  very  devout  to her;                     and insists  on  the  importance  and necessity of prayer to achieve this grace:                             Let    us    send    up  the  sigh  of  the  prophets  who    desired    the  Savior,                     praying  heaven  to pour out the Just and the  earth  to germinate  him,  for a good                     shepherd is the image of  the  divine shepherd, who gave up his blood for his                     sheep.","\"As the Father sent me, so I send you,\" the Lord said to the apostles,  who                     were the first bishops of the Church.  They  were entrusted  with this sublime                     mission,    and  converted  thousands  of  people.    Likewise,    many  learned,  holy                     archbishops, called by the Lord to this very hard mission,  consoled,  loved,  and                     made  the peoples prosper”... We take delight in reading how Saint Ignatius and                     Saint  Blaze  were a heavenly blessing for  their  dioceses, giving up even their                     blood.                            We are very touched while reading how Saint Charles Borromeo stood out                     for self-denial and charity.  He gave up his possession to  the poor,  and cared                     their bodily and spiritual good even  at risk  of  his  own   life !  Saint Francis  of                     Sales  ruled  with meekness the people entrusted to him.  He strove for the good                     of souls,  and  converted  them by the thousands through  preaching, example,                     writing,    and  sacrifice.  How  sweet  it  is  for  us  reading  how    Saint  Alphonsus                     Mary Liguori improved  his  diocese  through various  means  and a vigilant care;                     he rendered his  diocese  a model  and a field fecund of merits and virtues.  These                     men  were called  by  the  Lord...   Catholics  of  Messina,  let  us  lift continuous,                     ardent  petitions to the Lord and to Immaculate Mary so that God send to us a                     bishop according to his heart.                             We    think    that  this  is  the  Father's  first    article    on    the  Rogate;    his                     vocation,  however,  did  not allow him to  confine himself  to  this.  We try to                     follow him in the  affirmation  and development of his great ideal.                       110                        5. The Great Revelation                                Let  us hear the Father's interpretation of the  evangelical text:                             The  evangelist Saint Luke and Saint Matthew registered  our Lord Jesus                     Christ's great word.                            Saint  Matthew says:   As he saw the crowds,  his heart  was filled  with                     pity  for  them,  because  they  were  worried  and helpless,  like  sheep  without","a shepherd.  So he said  to  his disciples,  \"There is a large harvest,  but few                     workers to gather it  in.  Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will  send                     out workers to gather in his harvest\" (Mt. 9, 36-38).                            Saint  Luke (l0,  2):  he said to them,  \"There is  a  large harvest,  but  few                     workers to gather it in.  Pray to the owner of the  harvest  that  he will send out                     workers  to  gather  in  his harvest.\"                            The    meaning  of  these  words  is  obvious.    Harvest  means    the  people;                     workers  means  the priests as well as those who are  in charge with saving the                     people  entrusted  to  them:    the  people    are  many,  but  God's  ministers  few,                     therefore Jesus said: \"Pray to the owner  of the harvest,\" that is to say,  pray to                     God that he will send out numerous priests to his Church for the salvation of all.                            Rogate   - it  means  pray -  implies both  exhortation  and command,  and                     each Christian is obliged to obey it;  hence all of us  have to pray to reach this                     goal,  because Jesus Christ  wants it.                            These passages from the holy Gospel make a great revelation:                                 l. First, they manifest the desire of the most holy Heart of Jesus,  who                     was  to  create  the  true,    eternal    priesthood  on  earth  in    order    to  perform  the                     divine worship,  to offer  forever  the victim  of  infinite value,  and to continue                     on earth his  divine ministry of eternal salvation for souls.  Thirsty for souls as he                     was,    Jesus    could  not  help  letting  burst  forth  this  great    word,  this  divine                     command;  to quote a biblical phrase we say that  his zeal  was  devouring his                     divine Heart for a greatest interest  of his.                                             111                                 2.  Second, through those symbolical words Jesus represented the holy                     Church, the whole world, and each social organization as a harvest which should                     be cultivated by good workers to fill  the mystical  barns with copious crops;  if                     the harvest is neglected, it perishes miserably.                                 3. Third,  through these words our Lord Jesus Christ pointed out that                     his priests are the means of salvation for the  mystical harvest of souls;  no doubt                     that obedience to this divine command is  the  secret key that saves the Church                     and   society;  such  a prayer  is the holy Church's greatest means to expand the                     kingdom of God and to reach all goods in time and eternity.(l)                                 4.    Fourth,    our  Lord  wants  us  to  understand  that  to    obtain  this                     priceless good we have to pray to the owner of the  harvest, who is God,  who is                     himself. He taught us  that his priests do  not come   by   chance,   nor are self-                     formed,  nor are formed by  human effort;  they come from divine mercy that                     creates,  begets,  and gives  them to the world;  he teaches us that we do not get                     them, unless we pray !  Isn't it obvious? It is God that sends forth the saints on                     earth.  Isn't it a greatest mercy of his?   How can  we pretend  to  have  it  without                     asking for  it?   Our  Lord  Jesus Christ's command is very clear:  \"There is a                     large  harvest,  but few workers to gather it in:   Pray,  therefore,  to the owner of                     the  harvest  that  he will send out workers  to  gather  in  his harvest\"  (Precious                     Adhesions, l9l9, page 7).(2)","6. The Secret of all good works                                 Unfortunately,    the    Father    wrote  no  complete  work    on    the  Rogate.                     Treating the topic about prayer,  he promises \"a special chapter\" (Vol.  l, page                     66) on the Rogationist prayer; but, death prevented  him  to  do so.  However,                     because  the   mouth   speaks whatever  fills the  mind (Mt.  l2,  34),  and the                     Father's    heart  overflowed    with  love  and  zeal  for  spreading  the  divine                     command, being  never satisfied with calling the attention of the   people on  this                     subject,  the  Rogate emerges from  all  his  writings, revealing his spirit. Let us                     glean this field.                            The Father gives prominence to that divine word.                             More  than an exhortation,  the Rogate is a command  of  our Lord  Jesus                     Christ to the Christians on the whole,  and  to  the priests  specifically...   This                     word  of  the  incarnate  wisdom contains  a secret of salvation for the Church                     and society  (Vol. 3, page 57).                            It  is  God who raises his ministers,  who  sends  out  holy vocations from                     heaven,  but he wants us to pray.  The Rogate is a command.  The  most holy                     Heart of Jesus burns with the desire  of granting  such a mercy,  and hopes that          112                     the peoples (and all  the priests)  leave  out the negligence of this command by                     imploring holy  vocations.  While  seeing the ruin of many  generations  of souls                     redeemed  by his very precious  blood,  Jesus  cries  out: Rogate  ergo. Plenty of                     souls  would  be  saved,    and  many  of  them  would  achieve  sanctification  if  the                     mystical  workers    catechized,  edified,    and  instructed  them  in  the  faith  and                     religion  (Vol.  37,  page    l23).    \"The    Church  and  the  peoples  could    achieve                     copious  goods    from    the  faithful  obedience  to,    and  from    the    universal                     propagation  of this evangelical rogation (Vol.  44,  page  ll2). \"That  word  keeps                     the secret of the salvation of souls  and  the curability of the nations (Vol. 45,                     page 399).                            God made the nations curable,  but no remedy is so effective as  plenty of                     evangelical workers,  who are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.                     This is a radical  cure:  therefore, let  us adhere to this holy radicalism, if we want                     a sure  social rebirth ! (Precious Adhesions, l90l,  page 38). With regard to the                     Church,  society,  and the world,  the Rogate is the means  which achieves  all                     goods  and  the salvation  in  time  and","eternity  (Precious  Adhesions,    l9l9,  page  7).  This  word  of  Jesus  Christ  is  a                     command  of  the  zeal  of  his  divine  heart;    word  and  command  of  a  supreme                     importance,  sure remedy for the salvation of the  Church and society (Vol. 2,                     page l44). The Rogate contains the secret of all   good  works  and  the  salvation                     of  all  souls  (Precious Adhesions,  l90l,  page 5);  therefore,  it is not surprising                     if Satan  sees  the destruction of his kingdom in the  spreading  of this divine                     prayer (Vol. 2, page l45).                            It  goes  without saying that the obedience to  this  divine command  is                     the  holy Church's greatest means to  build  up  the kingdom  of God;  on the                     contrary,  the negligence of this  great means is the very cause of the desolation                     of the holy place,  the ruin of the peoples,  and of the nations...  Rogate ergo!                     This is the great word, the divine command which only the most holy heart of                     Jesus' zeal could give.  As the Bible says, this zeal devoured the divine heart with                     a  greatest  interest  of  the  holy  Church,  the  interest  for  copious  ministers  for  a                     greater  glory  of  God  and  the  salvation  of  souls  (God  and  Neighbor,    special                     issue,  June l925, page l3).                       7. The need of  priests                                                                                                                  113                            To  better  understand  the importance of  the  Rogate,  the Father reminds                     us of the priests' role in the Church:                             The  holy  Church  and  the  peoples  all  over  the  world  need  this  prayer                     because  God fixed beforehand that the priests guide human beings  to the truth                     and salvation.(6) God also established  that even  redemption is useless without                     the priests,  since they  are entrusted  with continuing it and applying its fruits.                     For  that reason  Jesus  said to the priests:  \"You are the  light  of  the world,  you                     are  the salt of the earth\"; but there is  no  light without the lantern shining on the                     lamp-stand;  there  is  no  way  to  preserve  food  from  corruption  without  the  salt                     keeping it.                            Both  Church  and society are  in  trouble.  Jesus  Christ's mystical  bride                     cries  for lack of  evangelical  workers,  while society's ruin increases!                            Wherever  good  appears,   faith  blooms,   the  souls  find salvation,  the                     youth  grow  faithful,    the  poor  are  relieved,    the  good  works  rise;    wherever                     religion is supported,  defended,  and protected,  error is defeated; wherever the                     laity is Catholic and active,  there you find the priest's work.  It is the","work  of  the  bishops,    of  the  holy  Church's  prelates,  and  of  the  clergies  that                     operates all the good you find on earth;   but all people receive light and splendor                     from  the  supreme  pontiff,    who  is  the  Church's  sun  receiving  light  from  God                     directly.  This great ecclesiastical hierarchy  is made of elect workers who are                     appointed  by    God    to  the  divine  ministry.  The  world  receives  life  from  its                     splendor.                            Please  imagine for a moment the priesthood dying out as the sun dies at                     sunset.  Wouldn't the world stay in darkness?   Where would  you  find God's                     worship,  the sacraments,  the  Eucharist, God's word, faith, and charity?  All of                     them would end!                            Now,  please imagine the opposite. Suppose that the earth is full of God's                     elect ministers, of numerous, holy priests: one for every  hundred persons and all                     of them are as holy as the ancient apostles. Wouldn't you think it would be the                     sudden salvation and happiness of all souls, no one excepted? (Vol. 3, page 59).                       8. How few are the priests today!                                The  Father describes the clergy's condition of those times, which is not                     better off today.                                                                         114                            To the question;  \"Which is the greatest torment of  today's Church?\"  he                     answers:                             The  great lack of clergy (Special issue,  June  l925,  page l4).  As in the                     old days, through the streets of Palestine, Jesus laments: \"The harvest is great,                     but the workers are few.\"                            When our Lord Jesus Christ said these words,  he was looking through all                     the centuries at the cities, the peoples, the regions of the world till the end of                     time,  and lamented over the lack of evangelical  workers,  which  at  times is                     worse  than  at  other times... (Vol. 43, page l49).                            If we look at our pitiable times,  we cannot help sharing in the  adorable                     Jesus'  Heart's  pains  for  the  great  lack  of    people  dedicated    to  the  mystical                     harvest;  the Church is  impoverished, the  souls  perish,  and  the desolation                     foreseen  by  Daniel  is expanding under the eyes of the shepherds of the Church.                     All  of them experience the lack of priests in the dioceses,  cities, and country                     sides.","A bishop wrote to me that 42 country parishes of his diocese have no priest.                     Other bishops complain too,  some of them   more,  some  less.   What  about the                     people?  My God,  what an  abyss  of misery!... (Vol. 43, page l50).                            And yet, the regions lacking ministers perhaps have innocent children who                     would feel drawn to ecclesiastical vocation, if they were cultivated in piety and the                     love of God.                             The    lack  of  financial  means  sometimes  prevents  the    parents  from                     encouraging  their  children to  enter  the  ecclesiastical status;  in  this case,  the                     seed  of  piety  instilled  by  the    Lord  fails    to  grow,    because  the  children  are  not                     cultivated,  or are hired  for a quick profit,  or the families are  indifferent.  In short,                     many  are  the reasons why so many youths remain  in  the world  to the prejudice of                     their souls and the souls  of  others, while they might have become holy priests (God                     and Neighbor,  May l9l5).                            Meanwhile,  who  saves the new generations?   Who breaks the bread  of                     God's word to the children who ask for it,  but do  not find  any?   Who  teaches  the                     poor  youths  so  much   betrayed everywhere?  \"Let  the children come to me\" (Mc.                     l0,  l4),  said Jesus Christ.  But,  who lets the children go to Jesus?   Perhaps the                     philanthropic societies?   Or the civil  colleges?   Or  the protestants? These  plunged                     in  everywhere    after  the  European  war  as  richly  hired  emissaries.  They  opened                     kindergartens - my God! - and  schools and colleges and orphanages free of charge                     in    order  to  get  hold  of  children  and  unchristianize  them.  They    teach  that  Jesus                     Christ founded no Church,  that the Church  is  invisible,  that  praying  to the most                     holy  Mary  offends  Jesus    Christ,    that  using    sacred    images    is    against    the    115                     commandments,    that    the  Eucharistic    Sacrament  is  not  Jesus  Christ,    and  that                     confession has been fabricated by the priests,  etc.  etc.?   My God, what a ruin for                     souls!                            It  is  our  priestly  duty  to  take  care  of  the  coming generations;  we                     cannot generate them to the grace with the holy baptism,  and abandon them to the                     wolves!...  But we are very few everywhere!  Very few workers...The people did not                     ask them  from the  Lord,  we ourselves did not;  we have neglected  the  remedy                     pointed  out by Jesus Christ,  and we have hundreds of priestless parishes... (Vol. 43,                     page l55).                            Oh!  how  many  youths  go  astray  in  their  prime  of  life  because  no    good                     evangelical worker receives them,  showing the  way  of piety  through pious unions,                     associations,    good  readings,    holy  industries,    and  true  zeal.    The  endangered                     honesty of common and civil  young women perishes,  for no minister guides them                     to  the sacraments through untiring preaching,  hearing confessions,  and teaching;                     no  one  helps  or shelters  the  poorest  among  them  through  resources of charity.                     How many beggars are immersed  in crass ignorance because no priest teaches and                     relieves them!  Who blesses and legitimates marriages?  Who safeguard the virgins                     who long  for  the  mystical wedding,  joining them with  the  divine spouse?   Who                     assists the dying when they are on the threshold of eternity?   Oh,  how  many sick                     people    languish,    dying    without  confession,    viaticum,    and    extreme  unction                     because no priest is available>                            Impiety,  unbelief,  anarchy  of any holy principle in faith and  civilization","make their way more and more into  the  world. Debauchery,  bad press,  sects,                     plots,  revolutions, misery, and desperation are increasing.                            The only effective, vigorous remedy to such a great evil and to  the  social                     wounds is to increase the  number  of  the  good ministers (Prayer book Good                     Workers page 6).                            If  we  look at the infidels' regions,  which are  the  most extensive,  our                     heart bleeds for the abandoned souls which are of as much value as ours,  are                     redeemed  by  the  adorable  blood  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,    and  are  willing  to                     meet the truth.  How  many thousands  of not-baptized  children are eaten by                     animals or  are thrown  down by wild parents in a river or at the foot of a tree,                     still   gasping!   How  many  thousands  of  wild   people   grow brutalized,                     dying  without  knowing  God and the  why  of  their existence.                            All  this  happens  for  lack of  workers  in  the  mystical harvest,  for  the                     missionaries are not enough for the needs  of the infidels' regions (Vol. 43, page                     l50).                            In short, today we can repeat our Lord Jesus Christ's words: \"There is a                     large harvest, but few workers\" (Precious Adhesions,l90l, page 11).                       9. Who are the workers?                                                                                                                116                             For sure, the priests. The Father writes:                             Aren't  the  priests  the new Christs sent to the  world  as Jesus himself                     was  sent  by  the  Father?...    Only  the  priesthood    is  able  both  to  destroy  the                     kingdom  of  sin  and  to  change  the  face  of  the  earth.    Its  power  is  unlike  the                     worldly power; it is a divine force,  a  miraculous  secret  attracting hearts and                     making    the  contrary    powers,    terrestrial  and    hellish,    impotent.    Nineteen                     centuries   of  Christianity  show  and  strengthen  this   truth evidently.   Without                     the  priesthood's  divine  efficacy  it  is impossible  to explain both the supreme                     prodigy  of  the    apostles,  who  regenerated  humankind  through  the  cross'                     foolishness,  and  the  wonders  that  the  apostolic  men  worked  to  support  the                     Church and save souls (Prayer for \"Good workers,\" page 7).                             The  Father acknowledges that good workers are also  outside the clergy:","Also  the  Catholic  laity  is  a  fountain  of  innumerable workers;   but,                     how    could  the  Catholic  laity  exist  without    the  priesthood    which    creates  it                     directly or  indirectly?   And  the sacred  virgins,  who  commit  themselves to                     the  spiritual  and temporal beneficence of the neighbor,  are also daughters of                     the Catholic priesthood (Miraculous Secret, l907, page l35).                             In  another place the Father touches upon the source of  the lay  apostolate                     which is associated with the  priesthood:                             There are apostles of charitable works who are not  priests; but they receive the                     grace of working the good at the foot of the altar,   where  the  priest  has  immolated                     the  divine  victim, depositing  him  in  the  tabernacle.  The  most  holy  Eucharist                     communicates    the    priceless  fecundity  of  all  good  works    to    the  priesthood,    and                     through the priests to the faithful  (Vol.  45, page 502).                             The Father's idea  widens:                             The    divine  word  is  always  a  sublime  synthesis    which    holds  innumerable                     mysteries,    spreading  manyfold  teachings  to  us.    The  divine  Rogate  ergo  must  be                     considered not only in relation to the priests  who are raised by the supreme vocations                     obtained by  the obedience  to  the divine command,  but also in relation  to  the persons                     that God raises for the good of his Church and  for  the souls (Vol.  43,  page l57).                     Asking workers for the holy  Church from  the Lord means first to ask priests according   117                     to his heart, and  second,  zealous Religious and lay people,  who full of  the spirit  of                     God commit themselves to the salvation of souls  (Vol. 2, page l44). As some persons                     sow and others  harvest, some people water  the  blooming seed with  their tears  and                     others  come  home happy with the reaped sheaves, some separate wheat from straw and                     others keep it in the barns and others distribute it,  so several agents work for the eternal                     salvation of the souls in the  social classes.                            The first agents are the princes of the nations,  the kings, the   statesmen,   and                     the  government  or  administration  high officers,  who  are abler  to cooperate with the                     Church  and  the Catholic priesthood for the salvation of the souls.  Oh, how much the                     culture  of  the  souls'  mystical  harvest  depends  on  those    who  are  in  power  !    The                     Catholic, pious rulers who are children of the holy  Church,   fearing,   loving  God,                     and  humbly  submitting themselves to Jesus Christ's Vicar, are the religion's right hand                     because    they    are  able  to  do  a  very  great  good  in   the    mystical  field  of  the  souls'                     harvest... Therefore, when they want to carry out  that great command of Jesus' Heart's                     divine zeal by  praying to  win  good workers to the holy Church,  they have to  put  the                     special intention to win rulers according to God's will.                            Good workers of the mystical harvest are also the educators, because   education                     implies  the  most  holy  Heart  of   Jesus' interests.   Plenty  of  bad  educators  are  the                     scourge,   the hurricane,  the storm, the tornado, which overthrows, upsets, and engulfs                     the earth ! Bad educators are the atheistical","or miscreant or dishonest teachers; poor the pupils who have such teachers>                                 Obedience  to the divine Rogate also implies the duty to ask the  divine                     goodness for sending  out  teachers,  educators,  and directors of the institutes                     who are believers,  church-goers, and God-fearing;  they  can  teach the mind and                     educate the heart  of their pupils.                                 This    prayer  also  helps  the  parents  as  those  who  handle    the  great                     harvest of the new generations;  through this prayer  they receive enlightenment                     and  grace  from  God,    edify  their    children,  keep  them  away  from  dangers,                     educate them in a holy manner,  and present them to God in compliance with                     their mission.                            But,  how few are the parents such as these, how often house and  family                     are a dreadful enemy of the human being !  (Vol.  43, page l58).                             The  Father's  words  foresee the Second  Vatican  Council's decree on the                     apostolate of laity.                        l0. All of them are brought about by the prayer                                                                                                                  118                             Meanwhile the workers are very few.  Do we have a remedy for that? The                     Father's answer is:                             Our    Lord  pointed  to  a  great,    universal  remedy    by    saying:  \"Pray,                     THEREFORE,    to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that  he  will  send  out    workers  to                     gather in his harvest.\" This supreme,  infallible remedy  is  tied  to prayer.  We                     called    this    remedy    infallible  because  our  Lord  cannot  be  mistaken;    if  he                     pointed  to  prayer    as  to  a  remedy,  it  means  that  the  prayer  will  be  heard,                     otherwise he would  have not recommended it.  It is as though he had said:  if                     you ask  me for workers for the souls'  harvest,  I will give them.  But,  it also                     means:  if you do not ask me for them, you will not have as many good workers                     as you need (Vol. 43, page l49).","The    Father  is  eager  for  stressing  the  following  point:    the  priesthood                     cannot die in the Church,  because the  Church  would stop existing:                             To tell the truth, the good works of the elects, the worship of  God,  the                     Church and the faithful's universal prayers  earned the  kingdom  of God and its                     justice through  Jesus Christ's  and the most holy Virgin's merits and prayers;                     hence,  the  mystical harvest  has  seen evangelical workers that were like  angels                     of  heaven,  almost  divine  beings,  wonder  of  heroism  and  holiness.  Who  could                     deny that? How many are the ministers of God shining in the clergy?  How many                     are the luminaries of science and holiness?  It would  be   a big mistake saying                     that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ    said  needlessly:    \"Pray,    therefore,  etc.,\"  and  that                     obeying perfectly this  divine command does not attain more and holier  workers                     to the mystical harvest (Vol. 3, page 59).                            The faithful must understand that the greatest mercy God may have on the                     people or a city is his sending out elect priests, as he  did with his only Son.                     Jesus said to his disciples:  \"As the Father sent me,  so I send you\" (Jn.  20,  2l).                     Vice versa,  the greatest  punishment God may give is depriving the people of                     his ministers,  or better yet, of the priests according to his heart. The faithful must                     understand this duty, accustoming themselves to pray  that  the  Lord  send out                     the  priests  to  catechize,  to administer  the sacraments,  and to guide the people                     to  eternal life (Precious Adhesions,  l9l9, page 9).                            When God sends out the priests according to his heart to the Church  and           119                     the peoples,  who can value the great good coming out of that?   Well,  if Jesus                     Christ said: \"Pray to the owner of the harvest,\"  it means that he absolutely wants                     us to pray,  and  he will hear this prayer infallibly; therefore, the more this prayer                     is  spread,  the  more the Church will be endowed with elect  and holy ministers.                     Being the priests the light of the world and the salt of the earth,  they will be the                     salvation for all  (Vol.  2, page l43).                       11. God wants it !                                The Father writes:                             If    both  the  prayer  to  win  priests  according  to  God  and    the  works    to                     propagate  this  prayer  were  coming  from  a  simple inspiration  and  from the                     natural consideration of its  utility, all  the peoples should preferably answer such                     an  advertisement for  its  high aim.","We know instead that Jesus  Christ  himself commanded  this universal prayer of                     the highest importance  (Vol. 43,  page l53).  We find remarkable that Saint Luke                     reports  Jesus  Christ's    divine    exhortation  by  using  the  verb  in  the    imperfect                     tense,  which  means used to say,  pointing out  how  insistently Jesus  inculcated                     it  (\"Special  issue,\"  page  l4).    Since  our    Lord  Jesus    Christ    commanded  this                     prayer,    he  himself  will  grant    it.  Such  a  consideration  is  very  comforting;                     therefore,  the  more  this  prayer    is  spread  and  is  made  general,    the  more  the                     peoples  and the nations will be provided with good evangelical workers.                            Thus,  the gospel will be preached all over the  world,  and will  prepare                     the  times when there will be one  flock  and  one shepherd (Precious Adhesions,                     l90l, page 38).                            Our    divine  Savior's  example  evidently  shows  the    importance  of    this                     prayer he suggested almost by commanding.  When he  was about to call the first                     ministers  of  the  new  law  of  grace,    those  who    were    destined  to  be  the  first                     fecund seed of  the  Catholic priesthood,  what did he do?   Which means did he                     choose to  form the twelve apostles' vocation?   Before seeking and calling them,                     he  retired on the mountain and prayed ! He prayed on the mountain to make his                     ardent prayer ascend to the Father  directly;  prayed  in  the  night     so that no                     human approach distract him  from  the enterprise he was communicating with                     the Father; prayed all night long   in  order to implore the Father by sacrifice;                     prayed    all  night  long,    shedding  tears  and  crying  to  be  heard  by  the    Father   120                     because   of   his  reverence !   Still  soaked  with   tears   and perspiration, as                     soon as he came down from the mountain he called the  apostles  to  make  them                     the  first-fruits  of  his  eternal priesthood.  What  a  great  teaching  he  gave  us                     to  make  us understand how much we must pray to obtain so great a grace (Vol.                     3, page 58).                                 This  way  he taught us that so great a  mercy,  mother  and origin of                     other mercies, cannot be obtained without long prayers> It  cannot be otherwise:                     before our Lord Jesus Christ came  into this  world,  he wanted the people to pray                     and long for him.  The priests are the new Christs: we must desire and implore                     them from the Lord (Vol. 45, page 504).                                 \"His mother treasured all these things in her heart\" (Lk. 2, 5l).  Did                     Mary keep her divine son's words idle in her heart,  as the lazy servant did with                     the money?   Not at all. She untiringly did  what her son commanded,  never                     eating  the  Eucharistic    bread  idly,  but  winning  the  altar's  ministers  with  her                     prayer from then on.                                 We  think  that the apostles did the  same.  When  the  Holy  Spirit                     reminded  them  what  Jesus  had  said  and  commanded,    how  they  obeyed                     zealously>                                 Also   Alapide thinks so when he explains the above  passages from                     Saint Matthew and Saint Luke.  In fact,  before joining the new apostle","Matthias to the Sacred College by drawing  lots,  the apostles prayed\" (Act. l,                     24). (Vol. 43, page 30).                                 The holy Church makes us repeat in the apostles' preface the following                     beautiful,    remarkable    words:    \"It  is    truly    worthy,  right,    convenient,    and                     beneficial  that  we  pray    insistently,    O  Lord  eternal  shepherd,  not  to  abandon                     your flock.\"                                 Always  moved  by the Holy Spirit,  the Church disposes  the Ember                     days  in  the quarterly three day  period  of  prayer  and fasting,  which  are                     destined to the sacred ordinations,  to  ask good workers for the spiritual more                     than the material harvest.                            But that passed almost unnoticed,  and the great command of Jesus Christ                     has not been fulfilled.                                 And  yet,  some  voices  during  the  centuries  called  the attention  of                     people  to  that  divine  command.    Saint  Hilary    says:  \"God  gives  us  this  gift                     through prayer.\" In his fervent prayer to the  Most Precious Blood of our Lord                     Jesus Christ,  Saint  Albert the Great exclaims:  'O Most Precious Blood,  we                     adore you in the holy Eucharist where you stay substantially... Please pour out on                     the  Church,  fecundate  her  with the saints,  enrich  her  with angelical souls like                     flowers in the Father's celestial garden  to spread   their  gentle  fragrance  all                     over  the  world.'  Faber commented  this  passage  of the gospel in  his  work                     Conciones, quoting  Saint  Jerome (Book 2 on the letter to the  Galathians): \"Let                     us pray to the owner of the harvest that he will  send  out workers to harvest,  to       121                     reap  the  Christian  people's  ears  of  grain  which    are  prepared  for  the  Church's                     future bread,  and to gather them in the granary, never decaying.\"                                 Also  Sacy  in  his  comment  on  the  gospel   says:   \"The evangelical                     workers' mission must be the effect of the  Church's prayer.\"  Blessed Vincent                     Pallotti published a brief prayer which begins  with:  \"For the sacred mysteries of                     the human redemption, send,  O  Lord,  workers  in your harvest.\" And  Saint                     Louis  M. Grignion  de Monfort wrote a long,  sublime prayer to bend divine                     goodness to grant such a matchless mercy.                                 In the biography of the Blessed Father Gennaro  M.  Sarnelly written                     by Father Dumartier (translated by Father Bozzatra, Festa publisher,  page  l04),                     we  read  a  letter he  addressed  to  a Religious,  from which we quote:  \"In the                     gospel the Lord says to his disciples:  'My beloved,  look around, see the nations                     of  the  world,    see  how  many  souls  are  ready  for  the  harvest:  the  harvest  is                     abundant,  but the workers are few;  pray to the Lord of  the harvest  that he will                     send out the workers to his harvest.'   All of you say often this ejaculatory prayer:                     'Lord of the  harvest, Lord  of the harvest,  Lord of the harvest,  send out workers                     to your  harvest.'  Please join this prayer to the merits  of  Jesus Christ's Most                     Precious Blood and to his zeal for the glory of the Father and the salvation of                     souls.    Almighty  God,    creator  of  the  souls,    send    out  numerous  workers  to                     gather in your harvest.  We commend the souls, who are so dear to you\" (Vol. 3,                     page 57). We, however, recognize that these were isolated voices.","12. Why the prayer?                                The Father makes and answers a question:                             If  the harvest belongs to God,  how is it that we must pray God to send                     out  workers  to  his  harvest?      The  reason  is  that    God  has    disposed    to    do                     everything for our  salvation  through  our prayer;  for an unfathomable mystery,                     God's all-powerful will, to be  fulfilled,  needs  the human being's frail will.  God                     cannot gather the harvest of the souls in order  to save them,  if  they do not pray,                     if they do not want to pray.                            Praying  to  the  owner  of the harvest  is  also  necessary because the                     sending out of the workers to the harvest as well  as the  abundant  gathering  are                     of utility  to  all  people,  whose salvation we must solicit and promote mutually                     through prayer.(4)                            What  institution  of  faith and charity  can  be  conceived without  the                     Catholic priesthood?   Aren't the priests  the  new Christs  sent  to  the  world as                     Jesus himself was  sent  by  the Father?  Toiling  for any good work is good,  but                     entreating  the Lord  to send out numerous ministers is very  good,  because  the                     Lord wants it. As a matter of fact, he sends them by raising here and  there his                     elects to the holy ministry through a gentle,  but strong  vocation,  which attracts      122                     and  transfers  people    from    the  world  to  the  holy  tabernacles.  Who  is  able  to                     resist his powerful call?  Vocations   such    as  these we ask by    obeying   the                     divine command:  Rogate  ergo...  That makes a great deal of  difference between                     the priests called by an omnipotent vocation and the ones who  are brought about                     by human industries and labor  (S.C.  Vol. l0, page 220).                            We also remark that since our Lord Jesus Christ commanded us to pray                     for good priests, the labor of the bishops along with the seminaries'  directors                     only reaches  an  artificial  culture  of priests,  if  such a command is neglected.                     The Church will  have half-priestly  vocations for lack of grace,  since only the                     most  extensive    obedience  to  that  command  through  the  most    extensive,                     interested prayer to win priests according to God may gain such a grace.  Oh !                     only the Powerful who is able to rouse descendants to Abraham  from  the rocks,                     can raise such  priests  (Lk.  3,  8). (Precious Adhesions, l9l9, page 9).                            Like  efficacious grace,  vocations come from  high;  if  we neglect  the                     command of our Lord Jesus Christ to pray,  vocations will not come,  nor will we                     achieve the effects of so many  works and  culture.  In  fact,  we","are unable to  infuse  efficacious, fervent vocations; only the Church's universal,                     fervent prayer is able  to do it.  If based on prayer,  the bishops'  work  in  the                     seminaries may become immensely useful and efficacious;  the same may  occur                     in the religious orders.  To conclude,  we insist  on saying  that the remedy is                     prayer.    By  making  no  use    of    it,    we  slight  it,    and  we  will  suffer  the                     consequences from lack of good vocations (Vol. 29, page l67).                       13. Prayer and action                                The  Father  does  not  undervalue  the    importance  and  necessity  of    the                     action  in recruiting and forming the  priests,  but  he demands  each  element  be                     given the  due  attention:  first  the prayer, and second the action, which should                     be the outcome of the prayer. He  writes:                             I  agree that we cannot provide the Church with  priests  by only  praying,                     because  action is necessary.  The institutes  of formation for the ministers are as                     many  as  the  religious    orders,  many    are    the  marvelous  seminaries,    and  the                     nascent  religious institutes.  But,  what does it mean?  What use is it without the                     prayer?  \"Unless the Lord build the house, they labor in vain who build it\" (Ps.          123                     l27,  l).  \"Every worthwhile gift,  every genuine benefit  comes  from  above,                     descending from the Father  of  the heavenly luminaries\" (James, l, l7).                            If  we want good ministers,  holy vocations to the  mystical harvest, prayer                     is necessary; we must obey that divine word (Vol. 45, page 503).                             The  association  of prayer and action is explained  by  the Father this                     way:                             We  must  pray  and  work to win good workers  to  the  holy Church.                     When  we ask God for a favor,  we have to  cooperate  in order to reach it more                     easily.  For instance,  if we pray for the conversion  of  sinners,  our prayer is                     more efficacious and  the conversion  is  easier if we add our means and  work  to                     convert sinners.                            Likewise,  we  must  not be satisfied by  only  wishing  and praying  to                     win  good  workers  to  the  holy  Church,    but  we  must  add  means  and  work  to                     achieve them. Oh, how all things are fast bound to each other ! (S.C. Vol. 5, page                     8).                            How  is  it  that  priests  sometimes  abound,  while  their priestly  work","is  lacking?   And  yet,  the  work  of  priestly formation  in  the  Church  is very                     active.  Both  dioceses  and religious orders have plenty of seminaries for youths                     along  with blooming  novitiates.   For  that  reason  we  make  a  point  of                     Providence    wanting    action  and  prayer  combined  to  produce    their  effect.                     Praying  to  the  Lord  that  he  will  send  out  good  workers  to  the    holy    Church                     without  working according  to  our  duty  and possibility to reach such a goal is a                     vain prayer,  it is like  a \"noisy  gong  or a clanging bell\" (l Cor.  l3,  l).  Vice                     versa,  working    for  the  priestly  formation  without  praying  is  a    useless  work,                     \"wasting its punches\" (l Cor.  9,  26).  Aiming at forming priests without asking                     them from the Lord is cultivating  priests artificially (Vol. 3, page 60).                            Most,  or  many  youth  enter the seminary  without  a  true vocation, and                     among those who become priests the ones with strong vocation  are  rare,  for                     our  work  is  unable  to  infuse  the effective, fervent vocation in the spirits; it                     can  only  come  down  from    the    Holy    Spirit.    But,    it    cannot    be    obtained                     without  resorting  to  the  prayer  commanded  by  our  Lord  Jesus    Christ.    The                     unanimous, fervent prayer of the holy Church to obtain effective, holy vocations                     can make the work of the bishops in the seminaries profitable and very effective.                            The same comes true in the religious orders (Vol.  43,  page l5l).                             Furthermore, the prayer is also able to achieve the material means for the                     training of the vocations:                                                                                                               124                            When    the  Rogate  prayer  becomes  popular,    it  will  make  pious  and                     eminent persons understand the great moment of such a  prayer and  the  great                     moment of having  elect priests according to  God,  moving  them  to grant the                     means necessary to their education  and success.  Thus,  the new clergy will be                     the outcome of prayer and action (Vol. 43, page l56).                            The  spreading  of this divine prayer helps the faithful  in many  ways,                     opening  their  minds  to  understand    the    priesthood's  importance  and  what  is                     related  to  it.  The  practice  of  this  prayer  brings    about    help  to  the  sacred                     vocations, because by  desiring and asking evangelical workers from the Lord,                     people are touched and provide the means to train them> (S.C. Vol. l0, page 2l0).","14. The Rogate and the clergy's sanctification                                   The    Father  specifies  the  difference  between  the    prayer    to  obtain                     vocations and the prayer for the clergy's sanctification. The latter is very good,                     but the former is more radical.                             We, however, remark that praying directly and explicitly for new,  strong,                     holy, and powerful vocations is more beneficial and more related to the divine                     exhortation or command, because we ask the most holy Heart of Jesus to form                     his saints. While explaining this saying of our Lord Jesus Christ, Alapide notes                     that when God hears  this prayer,  all the workers he sends to the holy  Church                     are saints (Vol. 43, page l56).                            With the Rogate ergo Jesus Christ pledged to send to us  men endowed                     with a divine character,  raised by God as a wonder as if they  were suddenly                     raised up from  the stones.  God is able to do so,  but he won't, if we do not pray.                     On the contrary, he pledged to do so, when we ask him for it (Vol. 3, page 6l).                             The Father develops these ideas:                                                                                                               125                            The  prayers the religious communities say by rule,  not  by vow, for the                     sanctification of the clergy do not concern directly numerous,    holy    vocations,                     but   the   present   clergy's sanctification.  Surely,  this intention is holy,  most                     holy, and those  who say this prayer gain merits,  but the results of  this prayer                     are scarce because they face the human will which  opposes the divine grace; this                     appears evident in the consecrated persons who do not improve their holiness.                            On the contrary,  the prayer or rogation,  which is based on the  Rogate                     commanded  by Jesus  Christ,  regards  directly  the sending out of the workers to                     his harvest.  The holy vocations of new priests are contained in the sending out,                     because  it  is  God's  promise    to  hear  such  a  prayer.    He  will  raise  persons                     favorably disposed, elected youth  who are dear to his Heart. He can infuse in                     them the powerful breath of holy vocation which comes from the Holy Spirit.                     This call is irresistible because of the Holy Spirit operating  a divine,  impulsive                     force  in  the  person  who  is  called  to  the  divine  service  and  sacrifice;    still                     remaining  free,  the person  is  drawn to answer the call and has no quiet,  no                     peace until he accepts and acts upon the powerful impulse.                            These  are  the true called,  the priests  the  Holy  Spirit formed  on the","ground  of  the  divine  prayer  commanded  by  our    Lord  Jesus  Christ:  \"Pray,                     therefore...\"                             In  another letter to the Blessed Guido  M.   Conforti,  our padre defines                     the nature of the Rogate prayer,                             which   is  different  from  the  prayers  aiming   at   the sanctification  of                     the clergy.  These prayers are excellent;  but Your  Excellence  know very well                     which grace is needed  to  rouse again an unrestrained minister of the Lord and to                     push him  again in the way of sanctification !...  Answering,  however, the divine                     command is different ! Here,  the matter is vocation from the Holy Spirit,  who                     transformed the shy, insecure apostles into powerful vocations after ten days of                     prayer.  God is having such vocations in  his hands,  but he is expecting that the                     prayer commanded  by him  snatches  them out of his hands to come down in  the                     hearts  well    prepared.    Who    knows    how  many  hundreds    of    thousands    of                     vocations the Lord keeps in store?  But,  how can people claim to have them                     without praying,  while God commands us to pray for it? (Vol. 29, page l63).                                                                                                                  126                     15. The merit of the Rogationist prayer                                To  foster the zeal of those who accept the divine  command, the Father                     says:                             Let us consider how many merits the people acquire when they say such a                     prayer.                            They  obtain from God what they ask for.  For instance,  the Lord  will                     send out a powerful vocation to an  elect  on  earth, because of the assiduous,                     humble prayer of someone. A person will hear in his soul:  \"Follow me !\" Still                     remaining free,  the people cannot oppose God's voice;  therefore,  the chosen                     one enters the sanctuary,  is endowed with understanding and spirit,  is lighted                     with  zeal for the sacred ministry,  and","becomes an apostle or  a missionary  or a pastor or a doctor or a preacher or a                     savior  of souls.  He  immolates  the divine victim every day;  through  the divine                     office  he  wails between the vestibule  and  the  altar, spreads  Christ's presence,                     edifies the Church;  he is different from a common human being.  Who knows                     the  good  he  produces  to  the  world  by  his  ministry?  Such  good  will  increase                     indefinitely until the end of the time.                            God  will  reward  this  elect  worker  with  ineffable  prizes,  but  also  the                     person who obtained that vocation by praying:  \"Owner of the harvest,  owner of                     the harvest, send workers to your harvest\" will share those prizes.                            Saint Vincent  de Paul said:  \"No work can be equal  to  the formation of                     one priest\";  therefore,  anyone who is able to help the  formation of priests has to                     do it with a will;  but  to  win priests according to God,  let us pray,  let us pray,                     let us make other  people pray the Lord to send them out ! Rogate ! Pray,  says                     the Lord to everyone.  Let us pray, therefore. May this prayer to obtain  the  good                     workers to the holy Church become  a  universal rogation,  directed to the Sacred                     Heart  of  Jesus,    the  center    of  the  man-God's  zeal,  from  which  came  the                     command: Rogate ! (Vol. 3, page 6l).                       16. Painful mystery !                                                                                                                127                            The  Father cannot help manifesting his astonishment at  how this divine                     word fell into oblivion during the centuries.                             The  peoples did not  pay  attention  to this  divine  command, and have                     neglected it completely (Vol. 3, page 59).                            Oh ! I think that this great remedy was almost forgotten, nor was  it  used !                     It  was  a punishment to  the  human  beings  who undeserved it> (Vol.  29, page                     l66). To tell the truth, this word of  the gospel was given little attention (Vol.  37,                     page  l23). Unfortunately,  it  is a painful mystery that this word has  been given                     no attention (Vol.  3,  page 63).  It remained a  concealed mystery,  because it                     was not given due attention (Ibid. page 57). For about 20 centuries -this is the                     truth- the great word,  which is a clear,  repeated command of our Lord Jesus                     Christ,  remained as  buried or unnoticed in the pages of the holy gospel...  God's                     inexplicable    mysteries>  Perhaps  God  postponed  the    manifestation  of  this                     mystery,  which, however, is so clear, to our times, when religion is deserted,  the                     cities  and  the  peoples  are  lacking  the  best  means  of  salvation  (Precious                     Adhesions,","1919,  page  7).  A Servant  of God once asked:  \"Lord,  why don't you send                     numerous priests  according  to your Heart to the holy Church?\"  Jesus  is said  to                     have answered:  \"Because people do not ask  enough  for them !\" (Ibid. page 9).                             The Father imagines our Lord talking with a person,  blaming how  people                     forgot  that divine word,  and exhorting her  to  be zealous for spreading it.                             Oh !  how little attention they paid to my command and  wish ! This  is                     the motive the Church's fields are desert  and  lacking workers,  while the wheat                     is being lost> Today more than ever  my Church  needs  ministers  according  to                     my    heart,    but    justice  disputes  with  my  mercy  because  of  the  men's  sins>                     Daughter,    pray  continuously    and    ask  ardently  from  my  divine  heart  the                     workers for  the harvest.  See how many souls perish,  because no  priest instructs                     or helps them,  guiding them to my heart> The blood  I shed  for  the  salvation                     of souls is  dispersed  and  fruitless, because no one applies it to their salvation.                            The  light of the world disappeared,  the salt of the  earth failed !                            Daughter,    pray    and    ask  saints,    saints,    saints    for   the  Church,    the                     cities,  the  peoples.  My heart cannot resist  the impulse  of my infinite kindness,                     which wants all people  saved. Knock  at  the door of my heart so that I open it                     and  send  out numerous, elect workers into the mystical harvest.                            My most holy Mother shares with me the burning ardor and the zeal for                     filling the Church with holy souls and priests according to  my heart;  the most          128                     pleasant favor you can do,  daughter,  is praying  to  me,  to my sweetest Mother,                     to the angels  and  the saints  to  obtain this grace of the graces,  this mercy  of                     the mercies.                            It  is  time to spread my divine command in the  Church  and form   a                     never-ending rogation of many hearts and   souls,   through which the heavens                     will open,  pouring the just on the earth (Vol. 2, page l49).                                  As we have said, God sent our founder on the earth to be the apostle  of                     this rogation:  let us look at him working  in  this apostolate.","Notes                                 (l)    Our    general    chapter    of    l968    treated    the    Father's  charism    in    the                     Declaration about the order's nature  and  aim (Declarations and Decrees, pages 3l-66).

First idea of the religious communities                                 We know what the divine command meant to the Father; let us now see                     how he devoted himself to it. As a layman and as a cleric he cultivated the prayer                     for the good workers. Listen to him:                             When he became a priest, he deemed that the foundation of a male and a                     female  order  that  would  commit  themselves  by  vow  of  obedience  to  the                     command of Jesus: \"Pray, therefore,...\"  would please the Heart of Jesus and the                     most holy Virgin, besides being a fountain of great benefits.                            The orders should be committed to the following three concerns:                            l.    To    pray  every  day  to  the  adorable  Heart  of    Jesus,    the  most  holy                     Virgin Mary,  Saint Joseph,  the angels, and the saints so  as  to  win numerous                     holy priests and workers  for  the  holy Church,  for the people and the nations of                     the  world,    and  to  win  extraordinary    holy  vocations  for  the  seminaries,    the                     religious orders, and the dioceses.                            2.  To widely spread the spirit of this prayer all over the world in honor                     and in compliance with the divine command.                            3.  To be workers of the mystical harvest for the spiritual and temporal           132                     good of the people within the sphere of their activity.                            Following    this    fixed    idea  the  poor    priest    examined    the  religious                     communities  and the religious orders existing in  the Church,  as well as those                     that were being formed;  he was  amazed that  no religious order had picked up                     that divine word from  the mouth  of our Lord Jesus Christ;  that command had                     almost  passed unnoticed.                            After reflecting on the gospel he reasoned that these words are words of                     Jesus  Christ  and  of  supreme  importance;  they  are  a  command  of  his  divine                     Heart's zeal...  then that priest - may God","forgive his daring  - began forming the two  religious  orders that are bound  by                     vow  to  carry  out  the  divine  command  through  the  three  concerns  mentioned                     above.                            Several  years have passed since he began forming these orders (Vol. 2,                     page l44).                             The Father’s writing dates back to about l905, when the institute and its                     works  were  quite  consolidated.  Now  we  point  out  the  expression  may  God                     forgive his daring, which reveals a state of his spirit?                            The    Father  did  not  start  his  institutions  after  planning  an  accurate                     program,   but  he followed   Providence,   which  usually  reveals   its  designs                     through  the    circumstances.    We  know  the  circumstances  that  induced  him  to                     devote  himself  to  healing      the  Avignone  Quarter,  whose  name  was  even                     unknown to him. Writing to Father Cusmano on August 7, l884, the Father points                     out:  \"It  is  more  than  six  years  since  I  have  started  some  institutions,  almost                     without understanding how I have involved myself in them\" (S.C.  Vol.  7, page                     33).    He    is  talking  about  the    charitable  institutions    without    making    any                     reference  to  the  religious orders,  to which he didn't feel called.  As a matter of                     fact,  he  was    persistently    asking  heaven    to  send  an  elect  to    guide    the                     institutions and the mission of the Rogate so that he might  join the  Carmelite                     Fathers and live under the protection of Our  Lady of  Carmel.  We  read  in  his                     notes:    \"On    December    27,    l893,  Wednesday,    feast  of  Saint  John  the      133                     Evangelist, after saying mass I  felt  a  joyful  increasing desire of  becoming   a                     Discalced  Carmelite    after    the    inauguration  and  the  handing    over    of    my                     institution to an elect person\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page 36).                                 It  was  humility  which impelled him to  such  a  decision, because  he                     felt  himself not qualified for the mission  of  his institutions,  nor he dared to call                     himself a founder. He writes: \"God did not raise the founder, his right hand man                     worthy  of  the  divine  word  and  of  the  order  having  that  divine  word  as  its                     heraldry, its mission, its vow, and its operations.                                 Indeed,  this  enterprise  of  a  supreme  importance  requires  one  of  the                     founders  raised  by  God  for  the  foundation  of  the  religious  orders.    O    God's                     unfathomable  mysteries!  O  God's  various  works!  The  formation  of  the  two                     communities  had  no  founder,  since  the  priest  who  began  working  is  only  the                     starter.   We expected for a long time a founder from Providence, a fit instrument                     of  God.  But,  since  God's  works  vary  in  their  proceeding,  the  founder  did  not                     come\" (Vol.  2, page l47).  The starting of that foundation seemed very daring to                     the Father, who felt compelled to ask God for forgiveness...","2. ROGATE in the institution                                To  understand  how  the  evangelical  command  influenced  the  life  of  the                     institution, let us hear the Father:                             Both  institutes  are  born  of,    in,  and  from  Rogate;  they  have  almost                     received    these  ardent  words  from    the    divine    teacher's  adorable    lips,    feel                     themselves  intimately penetrated  by  the Rogate,  have absorbed it as the hope                     of their existence in Jesus and  in   his  longing  for the Father's  glory  along                     with  the salvation of the souls (R.A. page 392).                            The    great  word  of  the  gospel,    -this  idea  was    a  child  of  a  greater,                     sublime idea,  that the Spirit,  who blows wherever  he wishes,  instilled  into the                     soul  of  a  spiritual  youth  many  years  before  the  pious  institute's  birth.-  This                     evangelical revelation, this  divine  idea, - abating it is not humility  - preceded                     and escorted  the poor priest starter in his  hard  enterprise.  This idea  became                     the pious institute's foundation,  as the key  that opened  some  treasure of divine                     mercies  and  the    secret    of    the  divine  favors  we  desired  so  much  (Precious                     Adhesions, l9l9, page 7).                                                                                                                134                       3. Program of the institution                                 Since we know the institute's origin and development, let us look into the                     spirit which animated it.                            As soon as the Father entered the Avignone Quarter, he had to face the                     inhabitants'  jumble.    That  was  the  case  to  recall  the  following  words  of  the                     gospel: \"Those unhappy persons were living like sheep without a shepherd...  So                     Jesus said to his disciples, 'There is a large harvest, but few workers","to gather it in... Pray to the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to                     gather in his harvest'\" (S.C.  Vol.  l0,  page 207).  Writes the Father:                             The  priest  who knew this divine secret started  the  pious institute in that                     enclosure of slums,  in that corner of  Messina we mentioned above, giving the                     pious enterprise the chief program of  practicing  perfectly  the divine command                     of    Jesus'    Heart's  divine  zeal,    \"Pray,    therefore...\"  He  gave  those  abandoned                     poor, who really formed a flock without a shepherd, the rule to pray in common                     to the owner   of the harvest.                            Listening  to  the  tender  voice  of  those  children  of  the  poor  praying  the                     Evangelical Rogation to win good workers to the holy Church was wonderful;                     from that pitiable place the prayer raised to heaven, up to the throne of the One                     who \"sees the sky and earth\" (Ps. ll3, 6) and \"listens to the wants of the humble\"                     (Ps. l0, l7).                            While that common folk was catechized and   children were educated and                     trained in arts and crafts, the prayer to win favors from the adorable Hearts of                     Jesus and Mary ascended to heaven. We taught the children by saying: \"My dear,                     we have gathered you for your  salvation,  but  you  see how many  obstacles                     hinder  both formation and steadiness of these institutions; we, however, have to                     trust,    to  serve  God,    to  love  Jesus,    and  to  pray  because    we  will  obtain                     everything through humble, confident, and perseverant prayer.\"   As   a matter of                     fact,   prayer was the   nascent institution's continuous breath.  Sometimes we           135                     prayed even in the night, keeping vigils (Precious Adhesions, l9l9, page 8).                       4. Leading concept                                 The Father continues saying:                             But I was continuously absorbed in the word of the gospel since the origin                     of this pious institution.                            I  thought:  what is the meaning of the few orphans who  are saved,  the                     few  poor who are  evangelized,  compared  with  the millions  and  millions of                     people who get lost and are  abandoned like sheep without a shepherd?  I looked                     at  my  poor  means,  at  the  smallest  sphere  of  my  activity,  and  sought  for  a                     solution.    I  found  a  wide,  unlimited  outlet  in  the  adorable  words  of  our  Lord                     Jesus Christ:  \"Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest that he will send out                     workers to gather in his harvest.\" I seemed to have found the secret of all good                     works and of the salvation of all souls.","Through this predominant idea, I considered this institute not simply as a                     charitable institution aiming  at  saving  some orphans  and poor,  but aiming at a                     greater and wider  goal:  the divine  glory,  salvation  of souls,  and the good of                     the  whole Church.  Both  the aim of picking up from the most holy mouth  of                     Jesus Christ the command of his divine Heart:  'Pray,  therefore, to  the  owner                     of the harvest that he will send out  workers  to gather in his harvest' and the                     zeal for fulfilling it in the best way  for  the greater consolation of the Heart of                     Jesus form  the goal of this institute.                            Truly, the spirit of God blows wherever it wishes (Jn. 3, 8);  he  chose                     what the world looks down on,  and  despises,  and thinks  is nothing,  in order to                     destroy what the world thinks is important.  This means that no one can boast in                     God’s presence (Cor. l, 28-29)>                            Divine mercy \"who sees the sky and earth\" (Ps. ll3, 6) liked to  entrust                     this pious institute of poor and orphans  with  this great treasure,  a precious seed,                     a grain of mustard,  which may spread  all over the Church with the blessing of                     the Lord.  Thus, the Lord liked to make the children and the youths, the orphans                     and the poor of this pious institute understand the importance of this divine word:                     \"Pray, therefore,\" etc.                                 The spirit of this prayer became quickly the spirit of this pious institute                     and formed its character, its aim, and its practice (S.C.Vol. 7, page 35).                                                                                                                136                       5. First prayer                          to obtain good workers                                 They began saying this prayer since the very origin of the community.                             When  the  Father  opened  the  chapel  at  Avignone,  he  had  the  divine                     command Rogate dominum messis standing out in the facade. On February l9,                     l885, he wrote to Father Cusmano: \"I am seeing to it that the spirit and the life","of  the  institute  be  the  spirit  of  prayer  for  the  interests  of  the  Sacred  Heart  of                     Jesus, that is to say,  the prayer to obtain good workers to the holy Church\" (S.C.                     Vol. 7, page 35).                            Then he wrote a fervent petition to the most holy Heart of Jesus for his                     communities and the faithful.  He thought that if a renown  institute  should  take                     the  initiative  to  spread  this prayer,  it  would  achieve  good results;  for  this                     reason  he appealed  to the Salesian Fathers through Don Rua,  inviting them to                     take  over  both  the  printing  and  the  advertisement;    Don    Rua,  however,    was                     unable to accept.                            The  Father  printed  the  prayer  in  his  typography  in  Messina.  (Typ.                     Avignone Quarter, l885).                            Through this publication, the Rogate began its journey into the world from                     the Avignone Quarter.                            In this petition to the most holy Heart of Jesus, the Father gives the most                     holy Virgin the title \"Mother of the Church\" about 80 years ahead of Pope Paul                     VI,  who  proclaimed  in  the  Second  Vatican  Council:    \"Supreme  Owner  of  the                     Mystical  Field,  hear  us  for  the  sake  of  the  most  holy  Mary,  your  Mother  and                     Mother of the Church.\"                                                                                                                  137                     6. The religious congregations                                The  charitable  institution  brought  about  the  foundation  of  the  two                     religious orders, whose hardships and fights have come to our knowledge; we                     recall them to understand their relation to the Rogate.   If  such  a  prayer was                     cultivated  fervently  in  the charitable  institution,  at  a greater reason it ought                     to  make itself pre-eminent in the religious orders.                            Says the Father:                             It  was  the turn of the two  little  religious  communities leading  the male                     and the female orphanages to become masters  of this  sacred patrimony of the                     Pious Institute of the Poor of  the Heart of Jesus,  to be trustees and guardians, to                     form the center of this important religious practice,  and  to become propagators                     of it.  As in any charitable institution, the inmates who succeed each other form                     the object, not the institute;","the institute instead   resides in those who are committed to the mission, who are                     united by the bond of religious profession through a name, a rule, and  the sacred                     garb (S.C. Vol. l0, page 209).                             Imploring the approval of \"The Little Poor of the Heart of Jesus\" through                     a  letter  of  October  28,  l887,  the  Father  reminds  Archbishop  Guarino  of  their                     origin and aim.  He repeats an idea we have read at the beginning of this chapter:                             It  would be pleasant to God and beneficial to the Church if virgin  souls                     gathered  joyfully  in  the  bond  of  charity  lifted    up  their    wails  like  doves,                     imploring  from  God  good  workers  to    the  holy  Church  with  fervent  and                     perseverant prayer;  this spirit  of prayer  should  form  the  character  and  the                     emblem  of  their institute. Since I began gathering abandoned orphans to lead                     them  to  piety,  I  strove  to  make  them  understand  the  word  of  our  Lord  Jesus                     Christ: \"Pray, therefore...\"                             Then  he reminds the taking of the garb of the four  novices bearing  on                     their  chest  the  emblem  of  the    Rogate;    besides    the  promises    of    chastity,                     obedience,  and  poverty they  made  the promise of \"praying the divine mercy to                     send out good workers  to the  holy  Church.\"  These promises should turn to                     vows in the religious profession (S.C. Vol. 5, page 3l3).                                 138                         7. External activity                          of the congregation                                The  Father  writes  that  the  activity  of  the  congregations  derives                     legitimately and immediately from the Rogate:                              That the two orders are concerned with works of charity and beneficence                     derives legitimately and immediately from the mission of the vocation prayer: in                     fact, if they pray continuously to win the good workers","to the holy Church,  if they follow the wish of the  most holy  Heart of Jesus                     through his  divine  command,  much greater  is  the  reason they have to strive to                     be    good    workers  themselves.    The    fulfillment  of  the  fourth  vow  not  only                     engages them to this continuous prayer, but also binds them to spread its spirit                     everywhere,  which  they  do  by  educating  orphans  and evangelizing the poor,                     by teaching them that the most  desirable grace  is  to  obey the command of the                     most holy Heart  of  Jesus through the practice of the Evangelical Rogation (S.C.                     Vol.  l0, page 209).                             Writing to his children, he presents the  Rogate of Jesus as a Decalogue                     which they pledge to observe:                             Committed  to  each word of this mystical Decalogue  (it  is made of ten                     words: Rogate - ergo - dominum - messis - ut - mittat - operarios - in - messem -                     suam),  we should feel ashamed to ask God and the most holy Hearts of Jesus                     and  Mary  for    good    workers  to    the  mystical  harvest  of  the  souls,    if  we                     ourselves were  not striving  with all our soul,  heart,  mind,  and body to be                     good workers with God's help,  our good will,  and pure intention. The divine                     words  asking for workers to the immense harvest  of  the souls keep ourselves                     ready,  miserable  as  we  may  be,  to  favor  with  God's  help  any  charitable,                     beneficent work,  either spiritual or temporal, whenever we may apply our efforts                     to it (\"Notes\" by the Father).                                                            139                       8. \"Truly a divine mission\"                                 The  Father  wants  his  children  to  feel  the  beauty  of  the  Rogationist                     vocation and become worthy of it through holiness of life and untiring zeal for                     spreading  the  divine  Rogate.  Such  a  prayer  makes  the  institute  unique  and                     singular in the holy Church, its littleness notwithstanding. In fact, he says:                             This least institute can say:  \"I am black but beautiful.\" I am black because                     of  the  starter  who  hindered  my  progress  and  because  of  the  contradictions                     surrounding  me;  but  I  am  beautiful  because  of  the  shining  reflection  of  the                     command  of  Jesus'  divine  zeal,  the  ceaseless  wail  of  the  prayer  that  I  am                     spreading  widely  everywhere,  and  the  most  holy  longing  for  seeing  the  holy                     Church rich with workers according to the heart of","God.  I am  beautiful because of  the Sacred Alliance of so many prelates of the                     holy  Church, who  bless me copiously,  offering me to God during the sacrifice                     of the mass;  at last I am beautiful because of the orphans I  am rescuing,  and                     the poor I am feeding and evangelizing (Vol.  37, page 69).                             At  the  beginning  of  the  foundation  of  the  sisters,  he  writes  to  the  first                     novices on July 2, l888:                             Jesus  will  teach  you  how  to  fulfill  the  great  mission  of  winning  good                     workers for the holy Church.  Our Lord Jesus Christ is so kind and merciful that                     he entrusts  you, who are humble and poor creatures, with this sacred, sublime                     task.    Really,  it  is  a  divine  mission!    The  point  is  that  a  miserable  little  poor                     creature  becomes  a  mother  of  innumerable  souls;  furthermore,  she  reaches  a                     greater glory by spiritually begetting priests to the holy Church!                            I feel myself confused, full of admiration toward divine goodness!...  You                     must pray to win the good workers for the holy Church, and work to win them...                            My dear daughters, the most beautiful field of perfect, charitable works is                     open before you.  If the good Jesus does not look on my sins, but blesses you,                     your vocation is formed and the zeal is ready, the zeal for the interests of Jesus’                     Heart  who  demands  prayer  to  win  good  workers  for  the  holy  Church,  which                     forms  the  fourth  vow.  \"The  zeal  of  your  house,  God,  burns  in  me  like  a  fire\"                     (John 2, l7). (S.C. Vol. 5, page 7).                                                      140                             As far as the Rogationist is concerned, he acknowledges and proposes:                             I    will    consider    these  words  as  addressed    to    this    pious  institute's                     congregants  in a particular way and as  though  the congregants had received                     them from Jesus Christ's adorable  lips. In this spirit, I consider myself fortunate,                     because  I  have  been  called  to  cultivate  this  divine  word,  to  which  I  mean  to                     commit my life.  I will often consider the appropriateness of this mission and the                     vow of obedience to this divine command, to which the institute's members are                     committed...    I  will  dedicate  my  life  and  my  intentions  to  the  prayer  of  the                     \"Evangelical Rogation of the most holy Heart of Jesus\"... To make this rogation                     universal, with the Lord's help I will be ready to meet any sacrifice, even to give                     up my life (Vol. 44, page l29).                             Preaching to the Daughters of Divine Zeal about the Rogate, the Father                     remarks and exhorts:","Two Evangelists have registered these words in the gospel. Thousand  of                     religious orders have devoutly studied  the  divine book  singling  out a verse,  a                     saying,  a  command,  a  counsel, choosing  them  as the foundation stone of their                     rules,  but  it seems  as though our Lord Jesus had concealed that sublime  word,                     that  command  under his hand,  and no one noticed it  until  our adorable  Savior                     revealed it to the poorest among his  creatures. He showed it, made it resound in                     your ears, had it printed in your heart and on your chest along with his wounded,                     blazing heart.                            Oh! Please profit by such a great and   inexpressible predilection.  Make                     use  of  it  incessantly;  lift  up  your  imploring  hands  to  heaven  and  wail  so  that                     heaven unfold; pour out the just, and let the earth blossom the \"saviors.\" Wave                     this sacred banner;  the more you raise to the owner of the mystical  harvest this                     prayer  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  commanded,    preserved  for  our  times,    and                     entrusted to you,  the more the good  evangelical workers  will increase on earth                     and the mystical harvest of souls will be saved (Vol. 45, page 399).                             The Father draws the conclusions.  First:  love for the institute.                             Let us love our institute; let us give ourselves to it in order to build its                     spiritual structure...   Let us not be disheartened...  Let us love the institute and its                     dear  name:  Rogation  of  Jesus’  Heart.  Jesus  loves  it;  he  gave  us  the  most                     beautiful hopes for its future; if we reflect on it, we realize that God wants it !        141                             Even  though  our  institute is small,  still  its  aim  and mission  are such                     that belonging to it and sharing in it make  us happy>  I am not speaking of the                     poor, nor of the orphans, but of the  banner,  \"Pray,  therefore,  to the owner of                     the harvest...\" What a mercy, what a gift> what an honor is our being appointed                     to  pick  up,  spread,  and  point  out  this  word  to  Christianity.  It  is  like  saying:                     behold, people, here is the remedy to all evils> Such  a  mission  is so sublime                     that  I  feel  like  annihilating myself> (S.C. Vol. 6, page 85).                             Second:  obligation of faithfulness.                             My little children! God entrusted a great treasure to us! But, we must fear                     of being deprived of it, unless we observe well the religious life.                            The time has come to spread the command of the Rogate; God entrusted                     this  mission  to  us.    But,  we  must  observe  the  religious  life,  lest  this  mission                     perish in our hands.   What did I say? Will it perish?  Not at all! If we do not                     observe the religious life, we will perish, but the Rogate will triumph!  God will                     snatch out of our hands this treasure,","and will  give  it  to others. \"He will rent the vineyard out to other tenants, who                     will give him his share of the harvest at the right time” (Mt.  2l, 4l).  Oh, little                     children! How can we think of such a misfortune without dying of pain?   Oh, we                     will never become unworthy of so great ineffable mercy.  To be worthy of it,                     however, implies that we  must be perfect Religious through the observance of                     the    vows  and    the    rules,      because    advertisement    and    pious    union    are                     inadequate  if  we do not belong totally to Jesus,  if we do  not form  an observant                     community dearest to the Hearts of  Jesus  and Mary through the practice of the                     vows and the virtues!                            Unless  we  are  men  of  prayer,    mortified,  detached,  lovers  of  Jesus  and                     Mary  as  well  as  of  the  cross  and  sacrifice;    unless    we  are    sober  in  words,                     obedient,  observant,  and  men of interior life,  our writing, printing, and being                     zealous are useless. But, if we are observant Religious, God will bless the little                     seed and the vocations will come.  Ah, let us renew ourselves, doing our utmost!                     Let us say \"Now I begin!\" (S.C. Vol. 6, page 90).                             Referring to himself with deep humility, he continues saying:                             Since  the  formation  of  a  community  mostly  depends  on  the  director,  I                     myself should say, \"Now I begin!\" If I don't, please pray  that I be put aside as a                     useless  instrument,    and  the    Lord  entrust    you    to  one  who  edifies  you,                     preserving the  very  holy  mission that Jesus,  Mary, and Joseph  give  you by           142                     saying: \"Rogate ergo...\" (Ibid.  Page 90). May the Lord help us to take advantage                     of the Father's teaching!                        9.  Titles of the two congregations                               Let us see how the Father executed the program.                            First  of  all,  the  aim  of  the  congregations  should  appear  from  the  titles                     themselves.  In the early times,  the Father  did not  concern  himself  with that,                     because  saving  the  Avignone Quarter  people spiritually and materially was an                     emergency; at the  proper  time  he would have seen to  the  permanent,  formal                     titles.    The  first  sisters'  title  was:  \"The  Little  Poor  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus\";  the                     citizens, however, called them: \"Canon","Di  Francia’s  Sisters.”Likewise,  our  clerics  who  attended  the  lectures  at  the                     diocesan seminary were called \"Canon Di Francia's Clerics.\" At its beginning, on                     May  6,  l900,  the  male  religious  community  was  called  \"Congregation  of  the                     Regular Clerics Oblates of the Heart of Jesus.\"                            The Father disliked these provisional titles, and searched for other ones                     which  corresponded  to  his  predominant  idea  of  the  Rogate,      which      was                     pervading the spirit of   the   nascent communities.  Says he: \"A name is of great                     importance for both an institution and its people.  How many names have come                     directly from heaven? How many names have been given by Providence?...                            For  many  years  we  have  prayed  to  God,  the  Father  of  light.  We  have                     asked pious souls to pray; we have said various masses to the souls in Purgatory                     for the naming...\" (S.C.  Vol. l0, page l09).                            January  l90l  was  dedicated  to  the  most  holy  Name  of  Jesus  for  being                     enlightened about the titles; the titles crossed the Father's mind on the last day of                     the month, during the mass, but he kept them secret.  The same year,  while in                     Rome,  the Father submitted  the  topic  to cardinals and officers  of  the  Sacred                     Congregations,  who  approved his plan.  On September  l4,  l90l, triumph  of                     the  cross,  he received  the  approval  from  Msgr. D'Arrigo,  Archbishop of                     Messina,  and the following day,  Sunday l5,  feast of the most holy Name of                     Mary,  he solemnly proclaimed the titles before the communities.                            These are the permanent, formal titles related to the Rogate:                                                                                                               143                            l. The prayer to win good workers to the Church was called \"Evangelical                     Rogation\" from the gospel word ROGATE.                            2.    The  religious  institute  was  called  \"The  Institute  of  the  Evangelical                     Rogation.\"                            3. The Religious of the congregation are called \"Rogationist Fathers of the                     Heart of Jesus,\" or simply \"The Rogationists.\"                            Also the name of the sisters springs ingeniously from the Rogate. Listen                     to the Father:                             If  we consider these divine words,  we see that they are  a manifestation                     of    the    divine  zeal  of  the  heart    of    Jesus,    who  repeated    them  many  times                     according to Saint Luke's  phrase,  \"he used to say\" (Lk.  l0, 2).  It is not \"he                     said,\"  but  rather,  \"he  used  to  say\"  indicating  habitual  action  meaning  that  the                     divine zeal never got tired of urging man to pray for this goal.  Given all this, the                     Evangelical Rogation can be paraphrased as the command of the divine zeal.","4. Consequently, the sisters' house is called the \"Institute of Divine Zeal.\"                            5.  The sisters are called \"Daughters of the Divine Zeal of the Heart of                     Jesus,\" or simply \"Daughters of Divine Zeal” (Ibid. page III).                             The  institution  along  with  the  two  orders,  the  orphanages,  and  the                     activities was commonly called by us in those times: \"The Pious Institution of the                     Interests of Jesus' Heart's,\" because it is concerned with the interests of Jesus,                     chiefly with obtaining good workers to the holy Church.                         10. Prayer book for the good workers                              Let us see how this spirit of prayer is practiced in the communities.                            Through  the  intercession  of  the  most  holy  Mary,   the communities                     offer  to the Lord all good works,  as well  as  the practice  of  piety,  faith,  and                     religion  with    the    intent    of  obtaining  numerous,    holy  workers  to  the  holy                     Church.    They  start  and  close  the  acts  in  common  by  saying  the  ejaculatory                     prayer: \"Send, O Lord, holy apostles to your Church.\"                                     144                            There are more daily prayers for this purpose.  The Father writes:                             Besides the prayer to the most holy Heart of Jesus, I wrote another one to                     the Immaculate Heart of Mary and a third one to the Patriarch Saint Joseph,                     universal patron of the Church.  The communities say one of these prayers in the                     morning, another one at noon, and the third one in the evening.                            Because    the    members  of  this  pious  institution    are    taught  about    the                     infinite value of the mass,  they consider it  as  the center of the divine wonders,                     the very effective means to obtain  any  grace,  and offer it every day to obtain                     good  workers  to  the  holy    Church.    They  also  offer  the  rosary  for  the  same                     intention in the evening.                            I have written a booklet (l) of vocation prayers, which are said every","day  by  the  two  congregations;(2)  the    booklet    also  contains  a  prayer  for  the                     clerics of the world and the  initiated into the priesthood, and another one for                     the reinstatement of the religious orders.                            The  prayer  to  Jesus  in  the  Eucharist  is  said  every  time  we  have  the                     Blessed Sacrament exposed, whereas the prayer to the holy apostles is said on                     their feast.                            During  the  Ember  and  Rogation  Days  the  practice  of  this  prayer                     increases.    The  communities  go  in  procession  through  the  house,  carrying  a                     banner with the divine command written in big letters and praying for numerous,                     holy ministers to the Church. Back in the oratories, they end the ceremony with                     more similar prayers. (3)                        11. Sacred alliance of priests                            for vocations                                 The  Sacred Alliance reminds us of the l897 painful  events, when a bunch          145                     of internal and external tribulations fell violently on the institute,  putting it on                     the verge of death;  only  God's mercy and the powerful intercession of the most                     holy Virgin saved it.                            In  the  midst  of  the  storm,  the  Father  was  tortured  by  the  following                     thought. Listen to him:                             When  everything  in  our  enterprises  seems  to  be  upside  down,  the  only                     comfort is submission to divine will, which guides everything to good results,                     even though we do not understand. The people who have experienced it know                     how dearly one pays for being submissive. In my case a circumstance made the                     cup more bitter; I had  to  submit  myself  to the idea  of losing  the  aim  of  an                     institute  which  is  committed  to  the  most  holy,  celestial  command:  \"Pray,                     therefore\"; I had to refold the sacred banner which makes the  most  holy Heart                     of Jesus' tender utterance  shine,  and  to which the salvation of souls is very                     likely connected through the shortest, surest way (S.C. Vol. l0, page 2ll).                             The  Father’s  last  resort  was  prayer,  in  which  he  insisted  day  and  night                     together  with  his  communities,  also  imploring  the  prayer  of  communities  of                     virgins consecrated to the Lord In those circumstances, he remembered a Servant                     of God’s saying: \"God's","blessings do not yet come down on this institute!\"  That person meant:  “God’s                     blessings do not yet come to fecundate and foster this institute.\" From that                     time  the  priest  starter    began  longing  for  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus'                     fecundating  blessings  like  Jacob  did  for  his  father's  blessings\"  (Precious                     Adhesions, l9l9, page 8).                            Then he deemed to appeal to his acquaintances and priests friends, not for                     money,  but  \"to  apply  the  special  fruit  of  the  masses  to  his  institute,  for  its                     advantage and improvement.\" He did so with a circular in July l897 (Vol.  37,                     27).                             We  strove  to  make the people hold  the  mass  in  esteem, teaching  them                     that  through the offering of the mass  we  might obtain any grace,  because when                     the divine victim is immolated on the altar, the heavens unfold pouring graces                     down.                            It goes without saying that the daily masses were applied to this purpose                     and that we received no offering for them\" (Precious Adhesions, l9l9, page 8).                     \"Holy mass and blessings! Oh! Who will offer the holy mass so worthily to win                     all the divine blessings for this pious institute?  Is this institute going to die?                     Besides attending to the salvation of souls, this institute is perhaps the only one                     in  the  holy  Church  that  fulfills  and  makes  people  fulfill  the  divine  command:                     \"Pray, therefore...\" On this ground we could not help trusting in the most holy           146                     Heart of Jesus for safety\" (Ibid.).                             First,  he  mailed  a  circular  to  the  bishops  of  Sicily,  then  to  the  ones  of                     Italy.  Later,  he advertised  the  Rogationist prayer,  requesting  the bishops to                     unite their intention to  the intention  of  the  members of the congregation  in                     their  daily prayer for good workers.  Finally, he asked the bishops to offer their                     works and prayers for the same intention.  Says the Father:                             After mailing this petition to the Church's prelates in the name of Jesus,                     we received some adhesion letters so expressive as to surpass any expectation.                     Through its high representatives, the Church seemed  to  give a helping hand in                     order to  sustain  the nascent  foundation,  pushing  it  forward in the  field  of                     the  Evangelical    Rogation  for  its  complete  shaping.    To  the  senders'  great                     satisfaction    the    four    spiritual    favors    were      granted  enthusiastically;    the                     Italian bishops' letters announcing their adhesion  are  most  precious  and they                     are  the  most  delicate documents of the pious institute's archive.                             At each arrival of precious adhesions, we rang the oratory's bells to give                     thanks to our Lord and to the Virgin Mary.  If some children were","under a punishment, they were relieved from it because that day was a feast for                     all\" (Precious Adhesions, l9l9, page l2).                             We  are  tempted  to  form  an  anthology  of  these  letters,  which,  however,                     have  been  published.    Now  we  confine  ourselves  to  two  quotations.    Msgr.                     Dominic,  patriarch  of Alexandria,  wrote on January  24,  l924:  \"Considering                     the topic,  I think no work  is comparable  to  the  one that the Spirit,  who  runs                     the    divine  economy    in  the  universe,    put  in  your  heart,    giving  genius    and                     strength for starting it.  I find no work worthier of praise and support.\"                            Msgr. Ruggiero Catizzone, Archbishop of Catanzaro, wrote on August 2,                     l900: \"I assure you that I longed for this institution for a long time:  you may                     imagine how your letter made me happy and satisfied. I fell down on my knees to                     thank God!\"                            Some  prelates  did  not  confine  themselves  to  say  one  mass  a  year,  but                     pledged  two  or  three  masses.    The  above  quoted  Msgr.  Marinangeli,  Cardinal                     Lualdi,  Archbishop  of  Palermo,  and  his  vicar  general  Msgr.  Peter  Boccone                     pledged a mass each month.                            Msgr. Boccone said that if his shepherd was appealing to the most holy                     Heart of Jesus by choosing the first Friday of the month to offer his mass, he was                     going to appeal to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by choosing the first Saturday                     of the month for the offering of his mass.                            Among the many effects, the Father points out the following:                       147                             l.  For  the  dioceses  and  the  seminaries:  Several  bishops  have  asked    to                     introduce the vocation prayer book in their  dioceses, especially in the religious                     communities.  The daily recitation of such prayers in the seminaries is of greater                     importance, because they improve the culture of the holy vocations and develop                     them as well.  Besides attracting divine mercy on their good success, by  saying                     these  daily  prayers  the  clerics  become  more    aware    of  the  priesthood's                     importance  and  mission,  finding  a  practical  rule  to    sanctify  themselves                     becoming  good  evangelical  workers  for  the  divine  glory  and  the  salvation  of                     souls (S.C. Vol. l0, page 2l5).                            2.  For the advertisement of this prayer: It is consoling to see how people                     begin  to  observe  this  command  of  the  Lord!    The  bishops  are  taking  to  their                     hearts this important prayer and are spiritually joining this pious institute in the                     daily prayer to obtain good workers to the holy Church.  They have pledged to                     direct their works and practices of piety to achieve this goal (Ibid. page 2l5).                             After the Father's appealing to the superiors general of the religious orders                     and to all the priests, the Sacred Alliance widened its horizons.                            A few years later, the Father tried to split the Sacred Alliance","in  two  branches:    the  Sacred  Allies  who  pledged  the  four  favors,    and    the                     Sacred  Allies  Supporters  who  also    pledged    to  advertise  the  alliance  and  the                     Pious Union; but the second branch dried  up  after  a fleeting  bloom.  The first                     branch  instead  developed  by  the  help  of  the  Lord;  on  November  22,  l922,  25                     years after the first adhesion by Msgr.  Giovanni Blandini, the persons who had                     enlisted the Sacred Alliance were:  38 cardinals, 2l3 archbishops and bishops, 34                     superiors general, and 624 priests.                         12. Pious union                           of the evangelical rogation                                 The  Sacred  Alliance  called  attention  of  the  hierarchy  and  priests  to  the                     Rogate.    Many  years  ahead  of  Pope  Paul  VI,  the  Father  wrote:    \"It  is  every                     Christian's duty to obey this divine command\" (P.U.  card,  page 3).  For that                     reason he  thought  of inviting  the faithful to this prayer,  especially the devout      148                     who attend the sacraments,  and above all the consecrated persons who share  in                     our Lord's thirst for the salvation of  souls,  because they  can  force the Lord's                     hand  through  their  prayer!    For  this  reason  the  Father  established  the  Pious                     Union of the Evangelical Rogation.                            Msgr. Letterio D'Arrigo, Archbishop of Messina, erected the Pious Union                     on Dec.  8, l900 in the oratory of the Rogationists' mother- house.  At midnight                     between  the  two  centuries,  while  the  communities      at  Avignone  were  in  the                     chapel,   the   Father inaugurated the first register of the Pious Union at the foot                     of  the  Blessed  Sacrament.    Msgr.    Letterio  D'Arrigo,  Archbishop  of  Messina,                     happened to be the top list member.                            The  Pious  Union  was  enriched  with  indulgences  by  the  Sacred                     Congregation  in  l906,  and  the  Father  published  the  registration  card,  the                     associates' rule, and the prayers.  The Father wanted the registration and the card                     to be free of charge (4).                            The Father conceived a periodical for advertisement.  On the","first  Friday after the octave of Corpus Christi,  feast  of  the most  holy Heart of                     Jesus,  he published for the first time  \"God and  Neighbor,\"  the  organ of  the                     Universal  Pious  Union    of    the  Evangelical    Rogation,    of    the  Sacred                     Alliance,  and  of  Saint Anthony's bread for our institutes.  On that occasion,                     the Father wrote of the Rogate:                             O Heart, abyss of the vivifying light, here is the echo of your divine wails,                     \"My  God,  the  zeal  for  your  house  devours  me...  The  harvest  is  great,  but  the                     workers are few; pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest that  he send out                     workers to gather it in.\"                            What a secret of your inner secrets! ...O most ardent Heart, may  the  zeal                     for  your house devour us,  the  banner  of  your Evangelical  Rogation  be taken                     over all the  world,  the  never-ending zeal spring from all hearts,  and may your                     elect  multiply as the stars and the sand of the sea. May the peoples be redeemed                     again,  the  nations  you  made curable be  the  trophy  of  your victory,  and  the                     Church along with his chief sing the hymn  of your triumphs! O Heart of the                     divine lover, we surrender to you and to your most holy, sweet mother. O Mary,                     together with Jesus you  are  our breath;  receive this periodical for and in  Jesus;                     together  with  him please help,  comfort,  crown us  with  happy results  for the                     infinite and eternal consolation of  his  divine Heart! (S.C. Vol. l, page ll0). (5)                             The little oratory of Avignone was the seat of the Pious Union for many            149                     years.    Later,    it  was  transferred  to  the  artistic  temple    of    the    Evangelical                     Rogation of  the  Sacred  Heart  in Messina,  on whose facade the Father had the                     ROGATE carved in big letters,  under  the bronze statue of the Heart of Jesus,                     who is inviting the people to receive and obey his divine command.                       13. To reach the Pope                                To  be  heartened  and  blessed,  the  Father  had  submitted  his  little                     institutions  to  the  Pope  more  than  once,  and  the  Vicar  of  Christ  always  gave                     them hearty paternal blessings.  The  Father, however,  was  not fully satisfied,                     because  after  presenting  the  institute    in    its  double  activity  of    charity    and                     Rogate,  the orphanages stirred sensation,  whereas the Rogate remained in the                     twilight.","In    the    first    days    of  January    l904,    writing    to    Father  Bernardino                     Balsari,  superior general of the Rosminian  Fathers, our  padre asked him the                     favor to hand a letter of  \"an  obscure, humble priest\" to His Holiness Pius X. On                     that occasion he wrote:                             We have two letters from His Holiness Leo XIII manifesting his delight in                     our  charitable  institutions.  I  would  like  that  the  Vicar  of  Jesus  Christ  pay  his                     attention to the mission as it is in the divine zeal of the Heart of Jesus, who used                     to say: \"Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest that he will send out                     workers to gather it in.\" I would like to dream of His Holiness considering it,                     and in case he finds it conform to the wishes of the most holy Heart of Jesus, he                     blesses, encourages, and fosters it with the word which fecundates and develops                     the institutions, even when they are in their infancy (Vol. 37, 45).                              We do not know what Father Balsari did. The fact is that our Padre wrote                     the  presentation  of  his  institute  to  the  Pope  in  the  same  month,  and  through                     Cardinal Merry del Val, secretary of state, he received these comforting words:                              Rome, January 30, l904                                                             150                             Heartily  accepting  your  request of  January  28,  I  have informed  the                     new  Pontiff  of  the  Pious  Association  of  Priests    in  Messina,    which    aims  at                     praying God to send out good workers  to the Church.                                 I  am glad to inform you that His Holiness is  very  pleased because                     the  Pious  Union has received the support  of  so  many eminent  persons  in  the                     ecclesiastical  hierarchy,   who  have recognized how to follow the command of                     Jesus:    \"Pray,  therefore,  to    the    owner    of  the  harvest  that  he  will  send  out                     workers  to gather in his harvest...\" With true pleasure he joins his prayer to the                     prayer of all of his associates and gives you and them his apostolic blessings.                      Faithful yours,                                                                                     R. Cardinal Merry del Val                             Imagine  how  the  Avignone  communities  welcomed  this  letter,  and                     joyfully pealed the bells...                            In  the  two  private  audiences  with  Benedict  XV,  the  main  topic  of  the                     Father's talk was the Rogate.                            On  November  ll,   l9l4,  when  the  Father  recalled  \"the exhortation  or                     command of our Lord,\" the Pope interrupted him by saying:  \"Command,\"  and                     added,  \"I am the  first","Rogationist,\" because I am the most involved in this prayer! The Father asked                     him to confirm the prayers of the institute and the Pious Union by \"adding his                     holy intention.\" The Father remarks: \"His Holiness assumed a solemn pose. He                     seemed to be very satisfied and recalled the communion of the saints! Since the                     communion of  the saints  is the participation of the intentions and of the prayers                     in  the  holy  Church,  he  said that  he  would  unite  his  own intention to ours.                     In  that  moment  he  attracted  the  intentions  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation  to  his                     most  holy,  sovereign,  pontifical  intention!    He  concluded  by  saying  several                     times, ‘yes, yes, I grant it!'  Oh! What a value our humble prayers gained!\"  (S.C.                     Vol. l, page l60).                            The second audience was on May 4, l92l. The Pontiff said to the  Father,                     \"This  prayer to obtain good  workers  must  mostly concern  the  Pope,  who                     feels the need of priests in  the  whole Church.\"  He agreed to enter his name for                     the Pious Union of  the Evangelical  Rogation,  and,  on May l4,  mailed to the                     Father    a  parchment      with    his    autograph,      praising    and    blessing      the                     institution.                        14 The Rogationist verse                                                                  151                                 The Father's speech to the Eucharistic congress of Catania in l905 shows                     the first intention of inserting a vocation prayer in the Litany of the Saints.  At                     the end of his speech he  said: \"If  the  highest  prelates of the holy Church deem                     it  right  to induce the energetic Pius X,  who is called ignis ardens, to make the                     decision  of  inserting  in the Litany  of  the  Saints  the following  verse:  'That                     you  send  out  workers  to    your    Church...  hear  us,    Lord,'  it  would  be  the                     beginning of great goodness  for the  Church and of eternal glorification for Jesus                     in the Blessed Sacrament!\" (Vol. 45, page 507).                            As  in many cities in those times,  the faithful of  Messina said  the  Litany                     of  the Saints during the daily  40  hours  of adoration in shifts in the churches.                     The Father thought it was of great momentum to insert the Rogationist verse in                     this litany to have   the vocation prayer said daily before Jesus in the Sacrament.","Today,  things  have  changed,  and  special  invocations  may  be  said  during  the                     mass.                            The Father’s proposal achieved no practical results in the congress, but he                     kept the plan fixed in his mind. On July eleven, l909,  in  the private audience                     with Pius X he obtained  for  his communities  the insertion of the following                     Rogationist verse  in the  Litany of the Saints:  \"That you send out numerous,                     worthy, and holy workers to your harvest... Lord, hear our prayer.\"                            To extend this invocation to the whole Church, the Father won the petition                     of many bishops to the Holy See. When the Father submitted these petitions to                     the Sacred Congregation of Rites and to Pius X, he pressured Msgr.  La Fontaine,                     secretary  of  the Congregation  of  Rites:  \"This matter of  great  momentum...  is                     particularly  entrusted to your faith,  zeal,  and charity.  As a secretary of the                     Sacred Congregation of Rites you may silence  or carry  the  cause properly and                     wisely for the greatest  glory  of God,  the good of the holy Church,  and the                     shaky society,  which can  only  be  saved by the priesthood of  Jesus  Christ>\"                     After insisting  on the Rogate's importance,  he repeats the  following idea:  \"The                     bishops seek to foster the seminaries (many of  them are closed) and to cultivate                     the clerics;  but,  if vocations  do not come from high,  from the Holy Spirit, the                     seminaries  and  the  novitiates    become    an  artificial  culture,    whose  results                     belong more to the world than to us\" (Vol. 29, page 63).                            Unfortunately,  on  February  20,  l9l3,  the  Sacred  Congregation  of  Rites     152                     answered: \"Delay.\" It means that the cause was not taken into consideration.                            Under  Benedict  XV’s  pontificate,      the  Father  won  new,  abundant                     adhesions to the cause. The Pope transferred them to the Sacred Congregation of                     Rites.    On  that  occasion  the  Father  wrote:  \"Nothing  new,  but  a  parchment  of                     praise and encouragement from His Holiness\" (Vol. 29, page l45).                                 In  the early times of his pontificate,  Pius XI adhered  to the request of                     the Cardinal Prefect of Propaganda Fide to  insert in  the  Litany  of the Saints                     the missionary  verse:  Ut  omnes errantes... for the conversion of the infidels to                     the  Church.  The  Father  wrote:    \"Is  it  possible  to  achieve  this  goal  without                     increasing  the  number  of  the  missionaries?    How  can  the  number  of  the                     missionaries increase without warmly obeying the command of Jesus to pray?\"                     (Vol. 43, page l5l). Therefore, the Father seized that","opportunity  to  also insert  the  Rogationist  verse,  and pressured   Cardinal                     Anthony  Vico,   prefect  of   the   Sacred      Congregation of Rites.  After                     informing him of the  previous request,   he  observes  that  the  missionary  verse                     should  be implemented  by the Rogationist verse,  and concludes:  \"If  you, Your                     Eminence,   consider  the  cause   worthy  of  your   high consideration,   you  can                     check  the  adhesions  of  the  sacred prelates,  submitting  their wishes to the                     Holy Father and  doing what the Lord will inspire.  Meanwhile I entreat  your                     Eminence to be wisely cautious and to conceal my name, because it would be to                     the prejudice of this important cause\" (Vol. 29, page l46).                        15. Three advertisements                                The Father uses three means to spread the Rogate: the Sacred Alliance,                     the Pious Union, and the Rogationist verse, developing all of them altogether,                     or  separately,  according  to  the  persons  and  the  circumstances,  but  always                     perseveringly and fervently.                            On January l, l920, he mails a circular to the bishops of Italy, and suggests      153                     several proposals for spreading the Rogate.                                 The  first  proposal  is  for  inserting  the  Rogationist  verse  in  the  major                     litany.  \"In such a case, the Church itself would pray to obtain numerous and holy                     priests\" (Vol.  29, pages l66-70). He resolves beforehand the oppositions which                     might be raised (6) and asks the bishops to write a warm petition to the Holy                     Father   in order to achieve the goal.                                 The  second  proposal  is  a  Rogationist  pastoral,  which  should  explain                     the command of our Lord, proving that all, especially the clergy, should pray to                     the Lord that he send out elect youths. Thus, \"the priesthood formed by the Holy                     Spirit  can  check  evil  and  save  the  peoples  from  the  material  and  spiritual                     increasing ruin.\"  The pastoral could end by suggesting the faithful to enlist the                     Pious Union of the Evangelical Rogation, which is the third proposal. The Father                     concludes:                             By doing so, you would draw the blessings of God on your seminary","and your mystical flock.                            Oh! If all the bishops did so in their dioceses, the prayer commanded by                     our Lord Jesus Christ as the infallible means to win priests according to the Heart                     of God would become a universal rogation. It would do a strong, sweet violence                     to the most holy Heart of Jesus and would win this grace.  But the people have                     become unworthy of it (Vol. 29, pages l66-70).                             Several bishops erected the Pious Union in their dioceses; some of them                     wrote the pastoral; as to the Rogationist verse, no result came out.                            However, the Father seized any occasion to touch upon his beloved topic.                        16. In the Eucharistic congresses                                 The  Father  talked  to the l905 international  congress  of Rome:  \"The                     Rogate  advertisement was taken into  consideration, and,  with  the  approval  of                     the  Pope's  vicar,  the  congress officially  expressed  the  wish  that  all  people                     join      their  intentions  and  prayer  to  the  Evangelical  Rogation\"  (Vol.  45,  page   154                     506).                            In  l905,  he  talked  in  Catania.    Considering  the  relations  between                     Eucharist  and  priesthood,  he  insisted  on  the  necessity  of  obeying  the  divine                     command:                             One cannot understand the Eucharist without the priesthood; nor there is a                     real priesthood without Eucharist.  Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament is the life of                     the Church:  when the faithful forget, or do not love,  or do not believe,  or do not                     receive  Jesus  in  the  Blessed  Sacrament,  then  the  Church  languishes  in  its                     members,  and falls sick.  Who is able to make up for neglecting Jesus in the                     Blessed Sacrament?  Who spreads his glory? Who shows his infinite love? Who                     excites the hearts to love and desire him? Who represses the errors?  Always and                     only the Catholic priest, because he creates the Eucharist, if we can say so. He                     generates Jesus","to the sacramental life, and prepares a perfect people for him.  Hence,  I dare to                     express  my  poor  opinion:  the  obedience  to  the    divine  exhortation:    \"Pray,                     therefore,    to  the  owner  of  the  harvest    that  he  will  send  out  workers  to                     gather in his  harvest\" is  the  best  means  to honor the most  holy  Eucharist                     and  to correspond to the sublime aims of the great sacrament  (Vol.  45, page                     502).                              The      father      was  unable  to  participate  in      the      l922  international                     congress of Rome, but he wrote a booklet: The Great Word, where he explained                     the  divine  command.  Jesus  militia  youth  handed  thousands  of  copies  to  the                     members of the congress.                            On  September  6,  l924,  the  Padre  spoke  at  the  national  Eucharistic                     Congress in Palermo, favorably impressing the clergy. Since he was well known                     in Sicily, when Father Venturini, S. J., introduced   him   to   the   audience,                     people   cheered   him enthusiastically, and some of the clergy moved closer to                     hear him from  nearby.  With his usual calm and with simple words  vibrant from                     this great love for souls,  the Padre began speaking  about our  duty  to prepare                     the Eucharistic triumphs for Jesus  and  to concern  ourselves  with his priesthood                     by obeying  his  command: 'Pray, therefore...'                                 After summing up the aim of his institutions, he urged the priests to                     spread the Pious Union and the Sacred Alliance, asking the bishops to promote             155                     the insertion of the Rogationist verse in the major litany. His proposal received a                     hearty approval.                        17. Always ROGATE                               Needless  to  say  that  while  dealing  with  people,  especially  with  the                     religious communities, the Father always touched upon the prayer to obtain good                     workers.                            For  instance,  after  praising the spirit and the works  of Father Cusmano,                     he writes to the Bocconiste sisters:  \"We cannot help  pointing  out to you the                     divine word of  the  gospel  which mainly  forms the spirit of our least institutes\"                     (S.C.  Vol.  5, page  23l).  Furthermore,  he  mails the  membership  cards,  and                     invites the sisters to enlist the Pious Union.","He writes to the Spanish sisters of the Blessed D'Agreda:                             I recommend to you the daily prayer to obtain from divine mercy plenty                     of holy priests and virgins to the Church, all over the world.\" He insists: \"What is                     the use of the priests formed by the bishops or by the religious orders, if God                     does not form them? A priest  formed  by  God  -I wish I  were- produces  more                     than    a  thousand  priests  formed  by  others>  God,  however,  let  human  beings                     operate.    He  only  intervenes  when  people  obey  the  divine  command:  'Pray,                     therefore...' But, how few obey it! The communities of the sacred virgins should                     say this prayer with great fervor, every day>\" (Vol. 38, page 48).                             As  soon  as  the  Father went to  Oria  after  the  Messina  earthquake,  he                     met the Benedictine sisters,  and exhorted  them: \"Let  us  spiritually join the                     Daughters of Divine Zeal in  their devotions...  especially  in  their daily prayer to                     obtain  from divine  mercy  numerous,  holy priests and  good workers  to  the                     mystical  harvest,  in obedience to the divine command of  Jesus' Heart\" (Vol. 43,                     page l25).                            He made a spiritual union with the Salesian Daughters of Holy Mary (The                     Visitation  Daughters).    He  commissioned  a  painting  to  symbolize  it.    He                     considered this fact as a new  manifestation of   the  Sacred  Heart  inviting  the                     Visitation  Daughters  to cultivate  the divine command according to their spirit,                     in  the words of Leo XIII:  \"From the Salesians we expect the triumph  of the             156                     holy Church;  they ought to pray to the owner of the mystical harvest to send out                     workers to his harvest\" (Vol. 38, page 2l and 4l).  The Father submitted to them a                     form to be filled out and mailed to the Pope for the insertion of the Rogationist                     verse in the major litany.                            When Don Orione was appointed vicar general of Messina by Pius X, the                     Father offered himself and his communities to him as humble subjects: \"From                     now on, all of us are subject to your wise direction, and we have proclaimed you                     our director general.\" But the  Father could not help calling the Servant of God's                     attention on  the  topic of his anxiety:  \"I present the personnel  of  our institutes                     along  with the sacred banner  and  its  inscription: 'Pray,  therefore,...' May you                     pick up this divine word of Jesus' Heart's  zeal  and make of it a holy mission,  as                     we  have  done, carving it in our hearts.  May you be an apostle and a propagator                     of it>\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page l20).","We like reporting some thoughts of the Servant of God, Countess Helen                     of Persico, who corresponded with the Father by mail.                                 \"I would be very happy to become personally acquainted with you, but                     I  do  not  know  how;  if  it  is  not  possible,  it  will  be  fine,  because all  of  us  are                     united in the divine Heart, as  you write very  well.\" We lack the letters of the                     Father,  but  from  the  answer  of  the  countess  we  know  the  theme  of  their                     correspondence: the Rogate.  \"I thank you for sending the vocation card to me.  I                     love it.  I will seek to spread it as much as I can.  Oh, may the Lord send out holy                     workers to his harvest; the harvest is very great, but the workers are very few>\"                        18. To Msgr. Conforti                                     We  keep  two  expressive  letters  of  the  Father  to  the  Servant  of  God                     Guido Mary Conforti, Bishop of Parma, the   founder of the \"Pious Society of                     Saint Francis of Sales for the Missions, and president of the Missionary Works.\"                                 The Father was not very pleased by the registration card  of the  Pious                     Society,  because  the gathering of alms was  at  the beginning,  whereas the             157                     ejaculatory  prayer,  \"Lord     Jesus,    please  multiply  the  number  of  the                     evangelical  preachers,\"  was  at  the  end  of    the    card.    The  aim  at  preparing                     zealous  missionaries,  the  condition  of  offering  two  soldos  a  month,  and  the                     advantages of the registration were explained in the middle of the card.                                 The  Father  could  not  help  complaining,  and  wrote  to  the  Servant  of                     God:                                  I  submit  to your consideration that to  form  missionaries according to                     God, the spreading of the prayer to the owner of the mystical  harvest  should  be                     given the first  place,  while  the necessary contributions to the candidates to the                     great apostolate should be in the second  place.                                 The matter is to be managed so evidently and clearly that the faithful                     must know that their alms will be blessed and two cents will be worth 200 liras                     when their cents are joined to the prayer commanded by our","Lord Jesus Christ...  We should amend the prolonged negligence of the                     divine Rogate by printing it in big letters upon the pious advertisements aiming                     at increasing the missionary works.  We ought to exhort the faithful to say this                     prayer frequently, as a command of the gospel. We should instill it in their hearts                     with all means and full explanation.                            Our  Lord  pointed out as clearly as he could how to  remedy the  lack  of                     workers in the mystical harvest  when  seeing  the crowds abandoned he used to                     say: \"The harvest is great,  but  the workers  are few;  pray,  therefore,  to the                     owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather in his harvest.\"                            \"Pray, therefore!\" Please consider the therefore!  Our Lord did not say:                     \"therefore, work to form the priests; therefore, gather money,\" etc., but he said:                     \"THEREFORE, PRAY!\" Both action and contribution for such an aim are holy                     because they are implied in the divine thought.  But, it is strange that what has                     been  clearly  said  hardly  receives  attention,  whereas  what  is  supposed  to  be                     implied receives full attention.                            Since  our Lord Jesus  Christ  recommended,  commanded,  and pointed                     out  to  the  prayer to obtain the  priests  as  to  the infallible  remedy,  what can                     we expect from our efforts,  if  we neglect  the  remedy pointed out by Jesus?  Is                     our toiling along with our money better than the remedy commanded by Jesus?                            Please sympathize with the pouring out of my heart into yours, which is                     full  with  missionary  zeal\"  (Vol.    29,  pages  l59-60).      Then      the  Father                     recommends  the  Pious  Union  of  the  Evangelical  Rogation,  which  is  free  of       158                     charge. (Ibid. page l64).                       19. A more terrible punishment                                     \"Lady Countess,   listen:  people say that the lack of ministers is the                     greatest punishment of God; I, however, know a more terrible one, which causes                     the lack of priests. The cause is  unwillingness to obey the command of Jesus'                     Heart's  zeal:    'Pray,  therefore...'    And  yet,      two  evangelists  report  that  Jesus                     repeated this command.  In fact, they wrote:  'He used to say: Pray, therefore...' It                     is not a man commanding this prayer, but Jesus","Christ,  God...    I  attribute  to  diabolic  influence  the  negligence  of  the                     remedy to which our Lord pointed out\" (Vol. 4l, pages l59-60).                                  The above countess is the Blessed Theresa Ledochowska, foundress of                     the  Missionary  Sisters  of  Saint  Peter  Claver,  for  the  African  missions.  She                     published  two  bulletins:  Africa's  Echo  and  Black  Child  translated  into  ten                     languages.  She  wrote  articles,  advertisements,  and  booklets  to  spread  the                     missions,  lecturing  in  several  countries  in  their  own  languages.    For  the                     missionaries she won financial means, religious goods, and thousands of books                     written in African languages.                                 The Father wished this foundress along with her institute to direct their                     attention to the Rogate.  On August 4, l92l, the Father wrote:                                  Given    the  great  needs  of  the  African  missions,    it  would  be  very                     pleasant to the Heart of Jesus if your religious family  of 93 virgin spouses lifted                     up  their  hands  to  heaven,  imploring  with  wails  and  sighs  from  divine  mercy                     numerous and holy  missionaries for the infidels,  for the Catholics, and for the                     whole world. We should not be selfish; when we are unable to give our personal                     help, we can help with the prayer (Ibid. page l60).                                  However, we must acknowledge that the Rogate's mission is a gift that                     the Holy Spirit reserved for the Father, to which he had to devote himself to an          159                     extreme.  He worried:  \"People do not know, do not appreciate, and do not obey                     the Rogate!                                 In    l906,    when    the    Father  thought    that    the    Rogationist  prayer,                     repressed for l9 centuries,  might burst everywhere,  he wrote  with joy:  \"When I                     see the spreading of the great resource for the nations, the Church, the world, and                     the  triumph  of  God  on  earth  I  feel  that    I  am  going  to  die  rather  than    to  be                     confused\" (Vol. 29, page 58).                                 But, many years later, the Father realized that the command of the Lord                     remained still forgotten... To whom should he appeal? Which means should he                     find?  The last means was prayer!... And he wrote a series of ardent prayers for                     the triumph of the divine command.  He appeals to the Holy Spirit, the Sacred                     Heart,  the  most  holy  Virgin,  Saint  Michael  the  archangel,  Saint  Joseph,  Saint                     Anthony of Padua... (Vol. 5, pages 66-74).                                 We have already quoted some passages, now we report the following:                                  ...  Omnipotent  God,  will  you  forget  humankind  because  of  our                     carelessness for the command of your Heart's divine zeal?  Do not take","vengeance as your perfect justice requires, because your Most  Precious                     Blood shed for the salvation of souls is at stake! Take vengeance instead through                     your infinite kindness and  mercy. As you said through the prophet Zachariah,                     spread into the Church the spirit of prayer:  the spirit of this divine prayer,  of this                     divine    rogation  that  you  commanded  as  an  indispensable  means    to  win    the                     mercy of mercies,  the grace of graces on earth so  that heavens  pour  out the just                     and earth bloom with  the  redeemers! (Ibid. page 67).                                 O Mother, see to it that the ecclesiastical hierarchy may be blazed  with                     the spirit of this prayer! You yourself enflame  the hearts of the sacred virgins,                     the pious nuns,  the lovers of Jesus,  and  men of good will,  whose names are                     inscribed in  the book  of life!  ...O Mother of the Church,  O Co-redeemer of  the                     souls, obtain the universal triumph of the divine Rogate from the beloved Heart                     of Jesus... (Ibid. page 69).                                 Like the sun at its rising shines from east to west,  so may the  divine                     command of Jesus' Heart's divine zeal shine  suddenly and  brilliantly,  especially                     in  the  minds  of  the    elect    souls.  United  to  Jesus  and  wounded  by  his  divine                     Heart's interests, may they be penetrated by this sudden, particular interest of his                     Heart, and wail and sigh continuously in the divine presence? May divine mercy                     quickly fill the earth with holy apostles?  May Satan's kingdom be demolished,                     God’s  kingdom  spread  everywhere,  and  Jesus  Christ  reign  in  all  the  hearts.                     Amen (Ibid. page 7l).                                                                                                               160                      20. The most beautiful and high mission                                     In  today’s  Church,  the  negligence  of  the  Rogate  that  the  Father                     lamented  in  his  times  almost  disappeared.    He  wished  the  Pope  to  intervene                     giving  way  to  a  crusade  of  prayer  under  the  banner  of  the  Rogate.    Pius  X                     defined the Rogate a command of Christ and Benedict XV said that he was the                     first Rogationist because he was the mostly concerned with this prayer.  I cannot                     forget  the  Father's  sparkling  glance,  his  hearty  smile,  his  full  joy  when  he                     announced  to  us,  at  the  end  of  l92l,  that  the  Pope  had  mentioned  the  divine                     Rogate in a prayer for","the propagation of the faith.  He wrote:                             We  cannot  help  considering  with  joy  the  rising,  as  the  first  ray  of  the                     nascent sun,   of this spirit of prayer or universal rogation by the work of two                     Popes!  (Vol.    43,  page  l52).  ...This  rising    from    on  high  began  advancing                     splendidly  and  shiningly since  the  early  days of Pius XI's pontificate when                     the  Pious Union of prayer was presented to him,  and he praised this prayer as                     the  work  of  the  works;  which  expression  is  worthy  of consideration.                                 Inspired word: God spoke through his Vicar!                                 Praying  for  holy  vocations  is  the  work  of  the  works...    Well                     understood,  this expression means: \"a work dedicated to this aim is  the  mother                     of many good works,  generator  of  great,  holy activities for the greatest glory                     of God,  the greater  salvation of  souls,  and   the amplest fulfillment of the                     Church's  divine mission in the world.  As a matter of fact, this is the work that                     wins the elect of God, bringing about the saints in the Church (Ibid.)                                  However,  the  triumph  of  the  Rogate  was  reserved  to  our  days.  The                     Second Vatican Council has:  \"The active collaboration by all God's people in the                     task  of  fostering  vocations,  ...  directs  that  the  organizations  for  promoting                     vocations  which  have  been  -or  are  about    to  be-  set  up  in  the  various                     dioceses...should  coordinate all  pastoral work for vocations,  and recommends                     the traditional aids  towards  this  general  cooperation,   such  as:  unceasing         161                     prayer...\" (O.T.  no.  2).  In Summi Dei Verbum (no. l2), Paul VI reminds the                     children of the Church of their duty to correspond to the divine command:  \"As                     to the vocations to the priesthood,  the first  duty  of all the Christians is to pray                     according  to  the command of the Lord:  'The harvest is great,  but the workers                     are  few;    pray,    therefore,    to  the  owner  of  the  harvest  that  he  will  send  out                     workers  to  gather  in  his  harvest'  (Mt.    9,    37-38).    The  divine  Redeemer  has                     clearly  pointed  out  that  the  first  source  of  the  priestly  vocation  is  God,  his                     merciful  free  liberty.\"    For  that  reason  he  established  the  worldly  day  for                     vocations on the feast of the Good Shepherd, fourth Sunday of Easter.                                 Is it a rash thinking that the Father’s prayers prepared this day?                                 We like to conclude this chapter with the encouraging words of Paul                     VI to the Rogationists.                                 In  the  audience  granted  to  our  capitular  fathers   on September  l4,                     l968,  Paul VI described the Rogationist and  the value  of  his  vocation  with                     these  words:  \"The  name  itself qualifies  you for your mission as worshipers                     who implore for the most beautiful","and high mission.  That of meriting and preparing the vocations to the kingdom                     of Christ\" (Speech of Paul VI, September l4).                                 We wish we were really worthy of so high a mission!                          Notes                                   (l) In l892, the prayer to the most holy Heart of Jesus was published in Milan                     by  \"Tipi  della  Biblioteca  Cattolica  Editrice.\"  It  was  translated  into  Polish  by  Lady                     Iastrzebsha, and the Father adds that “it was spread in that pitiable nation so needy of                     ministers.\"    We  also  have  a  translation  of  it  into  German  by  Father  Stephen  Leo                     Skibnierski from Tirolo.                                  (2)  The prayer book was printed by “Tip.  Edit.  Joseph Toscano  - Messina \"                     in l899.  It was translated into French,  at Amiens,  by  Abbot  De  Brandt,  a  holy                     canon  of  that  city's cathedral.  The Father hints at English and Spanish translations in                     the process for the Americas, but I think they had no success.                                  (3)    We  know  the  composition  date  of  only  a  few  of  the  above  prayers:                     \"Litanies of the Rogations,” on May 7, l888; “To the Holy Apostles,” on June 8, l888.     162                     We also know the  composition date  of  other  prayers  which  are  not  in  the  booklet.                     \"To Immaculate Heart of Mary for Obtaining Good Workers,” on March 2l, l885; \"To                     Immaculate Heart of Mary for the Sanctification of the Clerics,\" on June 9, l888.                                  (4)    After  taking  into  consideration  the  broad  meaning  of  \"evangelical                     worker\" (see ch.  4, no.  9), the Father gives full explanation of the intentions proposed                     to the members through the membership card:                                 \"To practically answer this divine command of the divine zeal of the Heart of                     Jesus, the Pious Union's members will offer their good works, practices of piety, faith,                     religion, holy mass, and rosary to the most holy Hearts of Jesus and Mary.  They will                     have a general intention and a few specific ones.                                 The general intention is to obtain copious, elect ministers, and strong workers                     to the mystical harvest.   The specific intentions are the following:                                   a.  That  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus,  through  the Immaculate  Heart of                     Mary,  give powerful,  effective  graces  of sanctification  and vocation to the persons                     called to priesthood. May they be like the apostles and the disciples who answered the                     call of Jesus?                                   b. That  the divine grace support,  guide, and make the elect  to  priesthood                     achieve  the  evangelical  virtues,  the  literary  and  ecclesiastical  education,  and  the                     priesthood.","c.  That  the  religious  orders  and  congregations  always  bloom  with  regular                     observance and abound in vocations according to God.                                   d.  That  the Holy Spirit always vivify his Church through the  sanctification                     of the ecclesiastical hierarchy's members  by renewing  the  wonders  of  charity,  zeal,                     and  fervor  in  the ministers.                                   e.  That  the  sacred  virgins who look  after  their  own sanctification  and                     the  salvation  of  souls  may  be  copious, zealous, and holy.                                   f. That Providence raises everywhere good educators for the salvation and                     good results of children and youth.                                   g.  That  the  parents  may  know  how  to  educate  their  children  in  a  holy                     manner.                                   h.  That  the peoples and the persons may take advantage of the  priestly                     ministry in the Church for  their  salvation,  and correspond to it with holy docility.                                   i.  That  the  spirit of the Rogate  prayer  increase  and spread  all over the                     world,  become a universal rogation  to  the most  holy Heart of Jesus,  and obtain the                     greatest mercy to  the Church.                                   j.    That    divine  mercy  keep  and  foster  in  the  divine  grace  and  love  two                     nascent institutes that nurtures the divine rogation for the first time, by granting holy                     vocations to them.                                   h.    Because  the  apostle  said  that  our  requests  to  God  must  be  always                     accompanied by thanksgiving,  the members of this Pious Union  will  do  so  when                     they pray to God  to  obtain  the  good evangelical workers to the holy Church. Indeed,                     he always sent to the Church apostolic men, priests, sacred virgins, good educators of                     the  youth,  and  workers  in  the  mystical  harvest,  human  ingratitude  and  demerit   163                     notwithstanding!\" (Pious Union Membership Card, l908, pages l3-l6).                                  (5) It is over 40 years that the advertisement of the Sacred Alliance and Pious                     Union advertisement is entrusted to the monthly magazine Rogate Ergo.                                  (6) These oppositions had been submitted by the Secretary of State Cardinal                     Peter  Gasparri,  who  did  not  want  to  alter  the  Major  Litany  because  of  its  venerable                     antiquity.  The Father answers that the Major Litany had been implemented with the                     verse against the Turks when they were threatening Christianity with death.  Besides,                     says the Father, how many changes have been made in the litany of Our Lady, in the                     canonical hours, in the missal, etc.  Today, Cardinal Peter Gasparri's opinion seems very                     strict, almost unthinkable!","164","6.                                                                                                \"HOPE                                                                           WHICH ENDS                                                                             IN HEAVEN\"                                         l.

Some episodes                                 l3. Notes","l. The eschatological hope                                 Now let us talk about the theological hope.  The Second Vatican Council                     calls it eschatological (G.S. no 2l) because its object is achieved in paradise.  It is                     defined \"the supernatural virtue which  makes us trust in God, from whom we                     expect the eternal life and the grace to deserve it\"                            (Saint Pius X's catechism).                            Hope follows faith.  \"Without hope, faith gives us a shallow knowledge of                     God. If we have no love and hope, our faith makes us know God as a stranger,                     because it is hope that throws us in God’s mercy and providence...  If I do not                     hope  in  his  love  for  me,  I  will  never  have  a  true  knowledge  of  Christ\"  (T.                     Merton, No man is an island, Milan, Garzanti, l956, page 33, 4l). \"Christ Jesus is                     our hope\" (l.  Tim.  l,  l).  This virtue stands out in modern theology, being the                     topic  of  various  conventions,  while  the  Second  Vatican  Council  reminds  the                     priests to “set up a steadfast hope for their faithful people\" (P.O. no. l3).                       2. His life was full with hope                                                            166                                The Father's hope was proportionate to his great faith.  His life was full                     with faith and hope, or better yet, his life was made of hope.                            He counted on paradise due him because of Jesus Christ’s infinite merits,                     and often said: \"Why  Jesus should  have suffered his atrocious Passion, but to                     ensure paradise for us?                          As a priest, he knew of the strict account he had to give to","the Lord  for the gifts he had received,  but he was  sure  that God's love                     and mercy would prevail.  He never had any doubt about that.                            He began saying every day Saint Leonard of Port Maurice's prayer for a                     good death at the age of 40.  He once said to me: \"Now I leave out that prayer: I                     draw closer to our Lord every day praying to him for a good death with a wailing                     heart.                            Due to God's infinite mercy, the Father thought that few souls are lost;                     only the mystery of human rebellion gives reasons for hell.  Therefore, he did not                     want people to be anxious for that.  He  used  to  say,  \"The  Lord gave  us  the                     prayer,  the sacraments,  the good works,  the protection of the Virgin  Mary, and                     the saints; what more do we need to ensure paradise?                            He  taught  that  people  must suffer and  work  to  achieve salvation;  and                     we know how much he suffered and worked  in  his life  of 76 years,  doing                     everything for the sake of God,  in the hope to see him in paradise.                         3. O Paradise...                                                                                                                  167                            We quote from the beginning of his Letter to the Friends this marvelous                     protestation of trust in God:                            O paradise! O kingdom of eternal glory! O end of our painful exile! O                     eternal city of God! O beatific vision of the One who is infinite beauty, infinite                     kindness  that  transpires  in  this  vale  of  tears  with  his  wonderful  rays  in  every                     good, in every beauty, and in the wonders of creation!                                 I long for this eternal happiness, for this region of light and splendor,                     for the everlasting vision of God   forever delighting, and containing everything                     in himself.                                 I  absolutely  want  to  avoid  the  eternal  damnation,    the  abyss  of    the                     eternal fire,  where Satan reigns for ever,  hating  God, Jesus Christ,  the most                     holy Virgin,  the saints,  and everything belonging  to  God.  Satan involves in his                     hate and furious suffering all the souls who followed, obeyed him, and fell into                     his perverse, subtle, invisible suggestions!","My friend and lord, won’t we be friends in heaven, in the bosom of God,                     delighting one another? (Letter to the Friends, page 69).                             Writing to Melanie on Aug.  l0, l897, the Father says:                               What is the staying in God's bosom for ever?  If  only  a small,  far-off                     reflection  of  God's  light makes  us  go  into raptures,   what  will the swimming                     in the infinite light  be?  O heavenly  company  of  the  blessed  and  the  saints,                     how  much desirable  you  are! O vision of Immaculate Mary, you make the elect                     happy! O eternal possession of God, you are the sigh of the hearts! Let us bless                     our sweetest Jesus, who redeemed us with his most precious blood and will make                     us happy for ever!  (S.C.  Vol. 8, page l).                             The  thought  of  paradise  comforted  the  Father  very  much  when  his                     relatives  died.    Despite  his  very  tender  heart  made  him  shed  tears  for  any                     misfortune and made him feel the sorrow for his relatives' death, he never cried                     for them. Father Vitale told us that our Father used to say:  \"They are in God;                     sooner or later I will see them again!\" But he always prayed and made people                     pray for them.  On his mother's death, he shed no tear, but conformed to God's                     will so perfectly as to appear insensible, in spite of being so tender by nature.                             Father Vitale reports:  \"One evening a few days later, a cleric and I went                     to  Avignone  to  express  our  sympathy.    We  found  the  padre  very  calm  and       168                     content knowing the will of God. He spoke of his mother’s virtues and of her                     holy  demise”  (Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di  Francia,  page  l02).    Father  Russell                     narrates that on the occasion of the death of our Founder's sister Catarina, the                     Father  went  to  the  chapel  and  said  to  the  Religious:    \"My  sister  died.  Let  us                     conform  to  God's  will  and  pray  for  her.\"  When  Sister  D'Amore,  the  mother                     superior  of  the  religious  community  of  Trani,  died,    Sister  Christine  began                     crying,  but the Father sent her to the church telling her to cry over the sins of the                     world.                             He  used  appropriate  words  while  consoling  the  survivors.    He  told  a                     young woman who had lost her mother:                              \"I  understand  your  great  sorrow:    your  mother  was  the  center  of  your                     affection and care.  She was so good, sweet, pious, and humble! I remember how                     she welcomed me the first time I came over here.  And you have lost her! But                     don't be disheartened.  Because you are virtuous","and faithful, you have to lift up your mind to God to contemplate her in                     him.  Our earthly life is a fleeting scene, because we are created for an eternal                     destiny.    Therefore  we  must  direct  our  aim  at  fulfilling  our  hope  of  being                     reunited in God's bosom\" (Vol.  42, page l24). Then he continued promising his                     prayers.                             When he met a man desolate for the loss of his wife, he told him:                              \"For us believers, our sorrow is easily mitigated in these circumstances.                     Many  people  go  to  America  promising  to  make  their  relatives    go  over  there                     later;    thus,    they  are  relieved,  do  not  suffer,  do  not  cry,  and  hardly  feel  the                     detachment.  Now,  paradise  is  the  destination  of  our  journey;  whoever  arrives                     first rests, waiting and longing for our arrival.  One day we'll be together again. It                     is a mere, fleeting detachment.\"                              These words impressed that man in such a way that he was consoled and                     convinced, repeating them for many years after.                       4. An apostle of hope                                                                                                                169                             The Father spread the hope and the longing for paradise around him and                     to those who had relations with him.                            By preaching, writing, and talking, as well as by friendly relations with                     pious,  or  indifferent,  or  atheist  persons  the  Father  spoke  of  heaven  as  of  our                     home.  He inspired the hope of paradise to healthy, sick, and dying people.                            Above all, he practiced the ministry of the hope among his communities.                     Perhaps  he  never  spoke  without  mentioning  paradise,  teaching  that  we  must                     achieve it by sacrifices after the example of the saints, whose lives he gave us to                     read.                            He told us that we must reach paradise for God's sake and mercy and we                     must foster such a hope. He often asked the little children, “Do you want to go to                     paradise?\"  At their affirmative answer he added, “Yes, all in paradise, but pay                     attention... pray, avoid sin, and do good works with faith.\"                            A Daughter of Divine Zeal testifies,                             \"Owing to his longing for paradise, he often talked to us","about it.  He described paradise so vividly as though he were looking at it.                     He trusted in the merits of Jesus Christ, who opened paradise for us through the                     shedding of his blood.  His talk ever ended:  'Daughters, as we are gathered here,                     so we hope to be in paradise'!\"                         5. Very eager for indulgences!                                The   indulgences he gained through specific   religious practices are also                     a sign of his hope.                            The  Father  declared  in a conversation that  he  deserved purgatory for a                     long time, but he added: \"This does not mean that I will be there so long;  I am                     greatly confident that God's mercy will shorten my time in purgatory because of                     the Church's prayer, and  also  because you too will surely make  nu  sfurziceddu                     (a little effort) for the Father!...\"                            He heartened the shy persons by saying:  \"Even though we had committed                     the greatest crimes, we should always trust and hope in God.\" While preaching,                     he once said: \"If I had betrayed God with my sins as Judas did, I would always            170                     trust in Jesus Christ’s merits for my salvation.\"                            Sister Gertrude was as simple as Nathanael.  She once said, \"Father, when                     I die pray for me, because I am very afraid of purgatory.\"  Kindly smiling the                     Father answered, “Who told you that you will go to purgatory?   In any case, you                     will  tell  the  Lord:      the  Father  ordered  me  to  say:    ‘don’t  let  me  go  to                     purgatory...'\" The simple sister affirmed that she repeated these words every day                     in  the  thanksgiving  after  Communion,  feeling  herself  more  confident  in  the                     Lord’s  kindness.    Sometimes  the  Father  said:    \"Why  should  all  of  us  go  to                     purgatory?  Can’t the merits of Jesus, of the Madonna, and of the saints free us                     from it?\" On a feast of the mother superior, a child wished the Father to expiate                     purgatory on earth. The Servant of God asked the child if she was happy to do so.                     At the child's affirmative the Father said, \"I","wish you so, because I wish it for me.\"                              Someone  said  that  the  Father  was  eager  for  indulgences,  and  for  this                     reason he recommended us to gain them on any occasion.                          After Communion he said the prayer to the crucified Jesus with great fervor,                     recommending us to look at the Crucified while saying such a prayer.                            The devotions he prescribed or recommended, and the Pious Unions he                     made us join with regular membership cards, aimed at gaining indulgences.                            A  sister  reports:    \"I  was  in  the  advertisement  office  responsible  for                     ascribing the new members of the community to the Pious Unions in order that                     they might gain the indulgences.  The Father often asked me whether all of them                     were ascribed.\"                        6. Detachment from earthly goods                                 The virtue of hope leads to detachment from earthly goods. If the Father                     sought and used human means, it was only for helping people.                             Money was always a means for doing well; it belonged to \"his lords, the           171                     poor.\" For the sake of them and to achieve heaven, he gave up everything and                     begged alms from door to door for over twenty years.  Usually  he  received no                     offering for  his  mass, thinking  that  his  seeking the kingdom of  heaven  had                     already  brought    him  money  in  abundance.    People  around  him  realized  his                     detachment from earthly goods and his trust in God.  After the fire destroyed the                     wooden  church,  we  began  gathering  offerings  for  a  new  one.  Father  Vitale                     writes:                               A public walk to gather offerings gave the start for the project; people                     answered generously with tears in their eyes and hope in their hearts.  A feeble                     old woman asked what all the people along the streets were doing.  When told                     about the fire at the church, she cried:  \"Do not be afraid! Padre Di Francia will                     build a golden, golden church!\" Some time later, and even though it was not the                     padre's  or  his  helper’s  intention,  those  words  turned  out  to  be  true:    the  new                     sanctuary was gilded (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 246).","Because  he  had  to  support  his  communities  and  institutions,  he  sought                     money  only  for  doing  well,  for  the  orphans,  and  the  poor.    Plenty  of  money                     passed from his hands; but not even a cent remained on them.  Detached from                     earthly things, he thought that being   somehow attached to them might offend                     the   divine providence.                             Prayer  was  the  secret  of  his  riches.    When  he  was  in  straitened                     circumstances, he wrote very tender letters to God, the Madonna, and the saints,                     which should penetrate their hearts, in his way of thinking.  Many of these letters                     are in our hands, many others were lost.                            The    outstanding    feature    of    these    petitions    is      trust:  hardships,                     tribulations,  and  present  or looming  persecutions notwithstanding,  his  trust                     stood firm.  Even when his prayers seemed to be rejected, he never forebore from                     trusting in the Lord; he could say together with Job: \"Slay me though he might, I                     will wait for him\" (Job, l3, l5).                            In  his  last  years,  when  the  offerings  came  in  generously  from  several                     nations, he was touched, and with clasped hands and wet eyes said:  \"How many                     good  people  help  the  poor!  How  good  the  Lord  is!  These  people  are  an                     instrument in his hands!                            When we talk of poverty, we will touch upon this subject again.                            Here  we  remark  about  the  Father's  care  in  cultivating  his  interior                     detachment. We quote Father Vitale:                                                                                                               172                            A   little childish but significant episode shows   the perfection the padre                     was  aiming  at.    At  Avignone,  there  was  an  affectionate  kitten  that  the  padre                     sometimes stroked and fed, feeling a childish affection for it. One day on his way                     upstairs,  he  found  the  kitten  dead.    Taking  it  seriously,  he  said  to  me:  \"I  was                     impressed...  perhaps I had some affection for the cat that the Lord did not want                     me to have!\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 309).                             Something alike happened to Saint Teresa of the child Jesus before she                     became a  Carmelite.   Her  dad had given her a new born white  lambkin as a                     present  which  died  two  or  three    days    later,  when    she    hoped    to    see    it                     prancing  around  her.  The saint interprets the lambkin's death this way:  \"My                     dear godmother, you don’t know how many considerations the lambkin's death                     inspired","in  me!  We  shouldn't  become  attached  to  anything  here,  not  even  to  innocent                     things, because they pass away just when we do not think of it!\" (Story of a soul,                     Lice, no. 839).                            Father Vitale comments the Father's remark this way:  \"We must admire                     the speech and the feelings of the saints\" He taught us to cut anything that could                     tie us to the world.  For instance, he  took  us  away  from  some  place,  some                     conversation,    some  friendship...    because    he  feared  attacks  on  us.    We                     remember so many teachings, because he tried to infuse so many of them in us!                            One day when the Lord was late in granting him a  grace,  he said  in  his                     simplicity:  'I  examined my  conscience  to  know whether  there was anything                     hindering the grace,  but I could not find anything'\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di                     Francia,  page 309-3l0). That reminds us of another episode:  \"Once we were                     considering Saint Ignatius’ connection with God.  It was so great that if he had                     seen his society destroyed, he would have needed only fifteen minutes to cool                     down completely.  At this point, the padre in his simplicity exclaimed:  'So long?'                     It was as if he wished human nature was not so reluctant to submit to divine law\"                     (Ibid., page 280).                        7. Trust in God                                                                           173                                The Father's great trust in God was the outcome of his hope.                                   The private or community prayers aiming at fostering trust in God                     are very many.  When in trouble, the Father used to spend the night in prayer                     before the Blessed Sacrament. He used to say: \"They who trust in the Lord are                     like mount Zion, which is immovable; which forever stands\" (Ps. l26, l).                            A  priest once said to the Father that some of his words  in the  Preface to                     Precious  Adhesions  showed  some  discouragement    in  the  presence  of                     insurmountable obstacles.(l) \"Yes,\" he  answered, \"but  I never lost my trust in                     God,    like  David  saying,    'I    have  reached  the  watery  depths;  the  flood                     overwhelms me'\" (Ps. 69, 3).","From his many letters and some oral expressions we know that he faced                     disheartening  internal  fights,  but  he  always  kept  his  interior  trust  in  God.  He                     often remarked that even the defects of a founder are a means in the hands of                     God to test the humility and the hope we must have in God so that no creature                     may brag before his presence.  The Father’s trust never went into an eclipse, not                     even in the darkest events.                            He had a very hard life, bearing in peace his troubles without confiding                     them to anyone.  In such cases he said: \"Let us pray, let us pray, and trust in the                     Lord; the institute is his work, and he will save it!\"                            Afflicted   but   not   disheartened for   the   increasing difficulties, he                     suggested  to  increase  the  prayer  and  to  repose  our  hope  in  God,  without                     confiding in any creature.                            He merely said, “I never confided in man,\" because \"he has only an arm                     of flesh, but we have the Lord, our God, to help us and to fight our battles\" (2                     Chr. 32, 8).                            One  day  the  Father was walking  with  Father  Vitale  and relating  to                     him the debts by which he was afflicted,  because he had  no  means to pay them                     off.    At  a  certain    point    the    Father  stopped    in  front  of  a  palace  and  asked                     whether the owners  would sell  it  to  him,   because  Avignone  was  too  small                     for    the  institute's  development.    At  amazement  of  Father  Vitale  who  saw  a                     contradiction  between  his  complaint  about  the  debts  and  the  will  to  buy  the                     palace, the Father said: \"What does it mean? The debts belong to me, but the              174                     purchase of the palace is of  divine providence's concern.                         8. Always hopeful                              The  trust  in  God  was  the  foundation  of  his  institute's  life.  On      the                     entrance  to  Avignone  the  Father  had  the  gospel's heartening saying written:                     \"Do  not  live  in  fear,  little  flock.  It  has  pleased  your  Father  to  give  you  the                     kingdom\" (Lk. l2, 32). He ended the daily work by","commending  himself  to  God,    saying  in  the  nightly    prayer  the  psalm,                     \"You who dwell in the shelter of  the Most High...\" (Ps. 9l).                            This kind of confidence he demanded from the   people entrusted   to him.                     When  Father  Vitale  underwent  spiritual suffering for many years,  the Father                     supported and heartened him in  any  occasion,  and when Father Vitale once                     asked to  make  a special  retreat,  the Father answered,  \"Father Vitale needs  no                     retreat;  he has to get rid of the nagging thoughts; he is in the bosom and the heart                     of our Lord\" (Vol.  32, page l7). On another occasion he wrote to him: \"How                     displeased is our Lord because you think of hell, while he loves you so much... In                     some revelations to the saints the Lord has said that the sons and daughters have                     not to think of hell, because they share everything with the celestial Father! Our                     Lord said to the apostles: 'Rejoice... that your names are inscribed in heaven' (Lk.                     l0,  20).    He  says  the  same  to  us;  therefore,  let  us  love  him  and  ask  holy                     perseverance, because we are not created for hell\" (Vol. 33, page 73). On other                     occasions:    \"Cheer  up!  You  have  suffered  so  much!  You  gulped  down  such                     things...  but Jesus is with you and will console you\" (Vol. 3l, page 9l).  Expecta                     Dominum, viriliter age et confortetur cor tuum (Vol. 3l. page 60).                             \"Let  us  look  at  God,  do  all  we  can,  and  go  forth\"  (Vol.  32,  page    l9).                     Speaking of the ones failing because of the war, he wrote, “Let us pray and trust                     in  the  heart  of  Jesus,  our  supreme  good;  he  will  keep  them  and  will  make                     provisions  for  us:    let  us  not  place  our  trust  in  man\"  (Vol.    32,    page  89).    175                     Defections,  or  disappearances,  or  deaths  notwithstanding,  we  have  to  go  forth                     trusting in the most holy Heart of Jesus, resolved never to leave out our work,                     even when we do not succeed... Let us do it in the adorable name of Jesus what                     we can, avoiding all pretence\" (Vol. 33, page l22).                            To  Mother Nazzarena,  \" I hope you are doing well and  both your  heart                     and soul are united with  Jesus,  the  only  eternal infinite  good.  Giving up our                     life for him even by as much martyrdom as the number of the martyrs is nothing.                     Place  your  past,  present,  and  future  existence  in  the  beloved  Heart  of  Jesus.                     When we realize we have displeased him, we have not to distrust or dishearten,                     because  we  would  hurt  his  heart;  on  the  contrary,  we  have  to  present  again                     ourselves in the presence of Jesus, saying: 'Lord, the one you love is sick'\" (Jn, ll,                     3). And also:  \"My Jesus, if my faults were more than the sea-sands and the stars                     in the sky, I would never like to distrust you, because your mercy is infinitely                     greater than my faults.\" Jesus loves so much","the repented, humble persons, and forgets their faults! Cheer up, and begin again                     to be holy\" (Vol.  35, page l3l). May everything help you to be humble before                     our Lord, being always trustful, because the humble trust pleases him. All of us                     should have  a  loving  repentance  of our  past  faults:  I  have  said repentance                     but not torment,  because the damned  have  torment, whereas repentance unites                     us to God!\" (Vol. 35, page 200).                             After the Italian defeat at Caporetto in l9l7, he heartens the sisters serving                     in a military hospital in Padua by writing to the mother superior:  \"I exhort you                     and  our  dear  daughters  in  Jesus  Christ  to  trust  in  the  divine  heart.  Don't  be                     dismayed,  but  be  confident  under  the  mantle  of  Immaculate  Mary,  our  divine                     superior.  Do your duty piously, comforting the soldiers and raising their morale.                     Be very observant in the practice of  the religious virtues,  above all in the love                     for  Jesus  and  Mary,    in  the    religious    observances,      in    the    holy    prayer,                     obedience, humility,  and  discipline.  By so doing you can be confident that the                     most holy Heart of Jesus and the most holy Virgin will protect you\" (S.C. Vol. 5,                     page 252).                             When  the  Morning Star Sisters were  suffering  exceptional tribulations,                     they  were  exhorted by  the  Father,  \"May  Jesus provide for the future of your                     institute;  certainly he will.  By divine decree the institute of Our Lady of Sorrow                     will bloom and spread for the divine glory and the salvation of souls. Meanwhile          176                     we are on the Calvary:  resurrection will come later. Let us have such a faith and                     trust  in  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  and  Immaculate  Mary!  Greater  are  the                     humiliations, the abandonments, want, and darkness, greater will be the mercies                     of our Lord Jesus Christ.  He will triumph in this institution\" (Vol. 39, page 34).                     Furthermore:  \"I have been touched by your letter; however, we must consider                     that the adorable Jesus is a loving father who does not let his daughters perish.                     He hides, makes us see things as though they were lost, but at proper time he                     turns everything to our good\" (Vol. 39, page 68).","9. The vows of trust                                A. The forgiveness of sins                             Let us see how the Father cultivated his trust in God. First of all we point                     out that such a virtue is a gift from God, and, therefore, the Father implored it                     through prayer.                            A prayer for the holy trust dates back to February l886:                              My Jesus, I beg you to give me the tender filial trust in you.  I fear you                     because you are the judge to whom I will account for  my  actions;  but you also                     see to it that I love  you  as  a loving  father  who tenderly nurtures his children.                     If my  sins, human  weaknesses,  and  malice  terrify and confuse me  in  your                     presence,  you  see  to  it that your  infinite  mercy  and  love comfort,  cheer  up                     my spirit,  and infuse in me a tender,  holy, filial trust in you! May your sorrows,                     your loving sayings,  and the finesse of love  of your heart be always present in                     my  mind; may  my  fearful soul have the heart to surrender  trustfully  to your                     mercy...  My Jesus, for your sake, for the sake of your open heart,  and for the                     sake of your most holy Mother,  Saint Joseph, all saints and the angels grant me                     this grace I need so much: the grace  of  a  tender  filial trust in you,  who  are       177                     my    father,  brother,    redeemer,    and    spouse    of    my  soul.    Get    rid    of    the                     obstacles which hinder me from having the full trust in you,  and see to it that I                     may sigh,  love,  desire,  seek,  serve you, and live and die completely abandoned                     into your hands (Vol.  6, page l40).                             The human spirit has its ups and downs;  and the persons who are  called                     to  holiness are purified by  God  with  exceptional spiritual  afflictions;  in  such                     a case they need  to  surrender themselves  trustfully  in the Lord's hands! We                     quote a  Father's prayer, which reflects his afflicted spirit:                              My    Jesus,    beloved  heart  of  my  Jesus,    time  after    time    an  internal                     affliction  and fear bring distrust and hinder me  from invoking, desiring, and                     loving you trustfully and tenderly.                             My Jesus,  if this is a torment for my not amended,  or  not confessed,  or                     not expiated sins,  I beg  you to illumine and move  me  with   your  powerful                     grace  so  that  I    amend    and    purify    my  conscience  through  holy  confession,                     atoning for my faults.                                    But,  if  this  affliction  comes  from  scruples,  or  temptations,  or                     weakness","of nature,  let me get rid of, or overcome it so that I may unite you trustfully,                     loving.  sighing,  and searching you with holy confidence.                             My  Jesus,  hear  my  prayer  as  much  and  as  you  want,  because  I  have                     already surrendered myself to you.  I am completely at your disposal\" (Vol. 5,                     page l42).                             The humble person never forgets his faults, and always fears to relapse                     because of human weakness. Nonetheless, he fosters his trust in God as a loving                     father  who  forgives  and  welcomes  his  repented  son,  even  if  he  has  sinned  77                     times seven.                             Such is the trust of the Father, who pledges himself to it through vows.                                 In the first years of this century he wrote:                             My Lord Jesus Christ,  kneeling in your divine presence like the  prodigal                     son at the foot of his father and helped  by  your divine  grace,  I protest through                     my vows to never distrust  your infinite  goodness,  clemency,  and  mercy in                     spite of  my  past, present, and future iniquities, either grave or light, in which I                     might fall. As for my past sins, I protest through my vows that I will be always                     confident that you have forgiven them, even though I do not give up the holy fear                     and the sad remembrance of them. As for the future faults in which I may fall,  I         178                     protest  through my  vows  that I will  never distrust your mercy,  even though  I                     might  fall in the most serious iniquities of the world;  I  will always trust to be                     forgiven  in  full  by  falling  down  at  your    feet  and  by  asking  pardon  for  your                     sweetest Heart's sake.                              Were  I  to  fall  seventy seven times  seven  in  the  same iniquities                     which  I  committed in the past or in worse  ones,  I protest through my vows that                     I will always trust in your infinite goodness,  imploring your pardon in the same                     way,  sure that your sweetest Heart's superabundant piety shall forgive me in full                     as though I had never offended you before. Therefore, I take my vows that  in                     any case,  and in any relapse,  I will come to  you  as though that fault were the                     first one,  sure that you will receive me  with  open  arms,  on condition that my                     repentance  be  true, sincere, and loving.                              O  my  Jesus,  please  do  not  disappoint  me,    but  grant  me  your  mercy,                     which is beyond my hope and confidence.  Amen. Amen (Vol. 4, page 89).                             B. The life of the institute                             At the end of September l898, the Melanie's departure was near.  She had                     saved the Daughters of Divine Zeal from shipwreck,","but the responsibility of their spiritual and economic life along with the hardships                     were  about  to  fall  on  the  Father's  shoulders.  To  prepare  himself  for  the  new                     situation  and  to  foster  the  trust  in  God  in  the  institute's  members,  the  Father                     conceived the spiritual union of the older and more affectionate congregants.                     Thus, God would save the institute by his mercy.                             By  the  Lord's help,   the individuals  of  this  spiritual union promise to                     redouble their trust in God's infinite goodness, in the most holy Heart of Jesus'                     infinite mercy,  and in the most holy Mary's,  in the angels', and in the patron                     saints'  powerful intercession.  The greater the growth of tribulations,  the want,                     the   human  suspicions,   the  perils  of  dissolution  of  this Institute,  the  more                     the members of this spiritual  union  will trust  in  God.  They choose as their                     motto the Apostle Paul's saying: \"We hope against hope.\" Therefore, they \"renew                     explicitly their  resolution  to  persevere in the service of  God  in  this institute                     in    spite  of    persecutions,    failure,    discouragement,  tribulations,    want,    and                     oppositions,    unless    the    Lord    shows  manifestly  through  the  ecclesiastical                     authority that he does  not want this institute any longer (Vol. 40, pages l22-23).                             The proceeding of the institute continued being afflicted by hardships and                     oppositions.  On his anniversary of July 5, l905, the Father glorified the Lord's                     kindness through another vow of trust, pledging to always hold that divine help           179                     will never fail the institute and promising to never be disheartened by his own                     sins and by the sins of the others.                             My   sweetest  Lord  Jesus  Christ,   in  the  sorrows   and tribulations,  in                     the doubts and want surrounding me,  I come  at your  feet,  expecting  your help                     and the appropriate  providence with humble,  loving confidence.  So that my                     confidence  may  never  fail,  because  of  my  frail  nature,  at  your  feet  I  take  an                     explicit vow of never distrusting, nor yielding to diffidence in the midst of want,                     disappointments, failure, and persecutions.  On  the contrary,  I  bind  myself                     through    a  vow  to  redouble  my    humble,  loving  trust  in  the  sweetest,                     superabundant, divine piety of your most  benign Heart,  as well as in the gentlest                     motherly  charity and  in the compassion of the immaculate Heart of  Mary,  who                     is your mother and ours.                             Helped by your grace and by my own good will,  I bind myself by  vow                     to have a steady faith and hope that you and  your  most holy  mother can and                     want to free us from any situation and  risk of dispersion; that you and your most                     holy mother can and want to maintain,","help, provide, shelter; want to  assist, protect, free, and save so many orphans,                     priests,  virgins,  and poor that  you have supported by mercy, as well as these                     nascent institutes that are  decorated with your divine word:  \"Pray,  therefore,                     to the owner  of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather  in his                     harvest\"   and  are committed  to  spread  this  word;  these institutes that you                     have  guided  and  protected  until  now  with  many  wonders  of  your  power  and                     mercy.                             Meanwhile,    my  Lord,    I  bind  myself  to  never  be  disheartened  in    the                     fulfillment  of  this  vow,    because  of  my  sins  and  of    this  institute's;    on    the                     contrary,  I will trust in  your  infinite clemency  that  you will pass over our                     indignity by  covering  it with  your  divine  merits and by atoning for it with                     your  Most Precious Blood.                             My beloved Lord,  please accept this vow and lock it in your most  loving                     Heart and in the immaculate Heart of  Mary;  please help  me observe it exactly                     in the most embarrassing  situations, even  when you have brought us to the hell's                     doors and almost   to  nothing;  then, please  see to it that full of humble trust,                     hope, and confidence I may have the living faith that you can, want and will save                     us unexpectedly even by working miracles of omnipotence and mercy! Amen!                             I say one Hail Mary to the most holy Virgin,  asking her  to bless  this           180                     vow,  to  help me fulfill it  faithfully,   to  hope against hope,  and to present it to                     the most holy Heart of Jesus. Amen (Vol. 4, page 89).                         10. The third vow of trust                                 The  efficacy of prayer bases on the trust,  since our  Lord said:  \"I give                     you my word,  if you are ready to believe that you will receive whatever you ask                     for in prayer, it shall be done for you\" (Mc. ll, 24).                             The Father teaches:                             Since  trust  originates  from  humility,  like  humility  it  is  an  essential                     element of prayer...  But, what is trust all about? It is a gentle union with Jesus                     making us sees him as our loving, benign, gentle, supreme goodness,","who is longing to communicate his  graces,  and  to  make us see him  as                     our    father,   friend,   brother,    spouse,    and    tender    lover.    This  loving    trust                     which remains  constant  despite contrary reasons,  drives the  humble, loving                     soul to hug the knees of the loving God and  to  look  at him with eyes imploring                     mercy,  even  when  Jesus  seems  unwilling  to  grant  graces  for  just  reasons;    it                     makes the soul follow God when he seems far away,  crying like the blind in the                     Jericho’s street: \"Jesus,  my Jesus,  hear my request;  I will cry till you hear me                     for your mercy, for your divine meek heart, and for your glory!                             Oh!  What a fervent, loving, humble, sweet, tender words a person will                     say  to  Jesus  when  she  is  full  of  holy  trust;  and  how  pleased  Jesus  is  by  such                     humble prayer full of trust.  Such a soul may draw any grace from his divine                     hands!    We  find  such  a  humble,  confiding  prayer  in  the  Canaanite  woman's                     mouth, which we must keep in mind (Vol. l, page 65).                             The Father is an example for us.  His trust in the prayer never failed, and                     we will touch upon it over again.  Here, we point out that he bound himself to it                     by  vow  in  order  to  fortify  his  trust.    He  did  so  on  May  5,  l9l0,  feast  of  the                     Ascension, in San Pier Niceto, where he was preaching the novena for Our Lady                     of Pompei. In that time his  orphanages were threatened with death by the lay                     authority for the events in Francavilla Fontana.  We quote:                               181                             My  beloved  Lord Jesus Christ,  kneeling  in  your  divine presence,  in                     the  abyss of my nothingness I protest through  my vows  that  I always want to                     trust in your infinite  goodness  as well  as in your divine promises that you hear                     our  prayers.  You said:  \"The Father will give you whatever you ask of him in                     my name\" (Jn.  l5,  l6);  \"Ask,  and you will receive; seek, and you will find;                     knock, and the door will be opened to you\" (Mt. 7, 7); \"Until  now you have                     not asked for anything in my name;  ask  and you  will receive,  so that your                     happiness may be complete\"  (Jn. l6,  24). Likewise, I intend to confide in the                     expressive parable of the friend knocking at another friend's door in the night and                     asking  for  three  loaves  to  welcome  other  persons  -  the  friend,  my  supreme                     goodness. - Even though the friend was unwilling to get up to give the loaves,                     still he surrendered because of the importunity of the situation, and gave the three                     loaves. Also in the parable of the woman seeking justice from an unjust judge not                     from a judge friend, what a wonder!  and the unjust judge - you  are not,  my                     supreme goodness - satisfied that woman because of her importunity!                             In the presence of these ineffable and  surprising promises, I take my vow                     to always trust in you,  in your adorable Heart, in your  infinite goodness and                     liberality,    as  well  as  in  your    most  holy  mother,    in    your  angels  and  saints,                     whom I implore in your name. I trust that you will infallibly grant me the graces                     I have asked, the ones I am used to ask,","and will ask for your  glory, for  the salvation of the souls,  for me the miserable                     and  for  my  relatives,    as    well  as  for  the  Rogation's  and  for  Divine    Zeal's                     institutes along with their charitable and religious works.  If I ask  you or your                     most  holy  mother  or  the  angels  or  the  saints  for  these  graces,    mercies,  and                     celestial favors with pure intention, humility,   holy  fervor,  pious  insistence,                     and  perseverance, conforming to your adorable merciful will,  I trust that you                     will hear me.                             My  beloved  love,  if  after  praying  with  all  the  good dispositions  and                     with the greatest trust I do not receive  these graces and mercies,  or I think of not                     receiving them,  all  this notwithstanding   I  take  vows  to  always  believe  your                     true, infallible, divine promises, imputing to my unworthiness and ill-dispositions                     the  cause  for not obtaining the  graces  and  the mercies that I ask for myself                     and for others.  Therefore,  I will humble myself,  will hope and strive to become                     worthy,  making my petitions through your divine merits,  through the merits of                     your most holy mother,  the angels, and the saints, as well as through the merits                     of  the  just  and  innocent  souls.    I  will  always    firmly  believe  that  you,    most                     liberal  Lord,  can  and  want  and  will  grant  the    graces,    the  mercies,    and  the                     celestial favors that I  have asked, I am asking,  and  will ask.                             Sweet  Heart of my Jesus,  even though you or your most holy mother  or                     the angels or the saints do not  hear,  or  repel  my prayers  seventy seven times                     seven,   and quite the reverse of my petitions  happens to me,  I take my vow that        182                     my trust  will  not fail with your help.  I will hope against hope, always asking                     and waiting for the divine mercies; to do homage to your infallible promises, I                     trust and will trust that you will always grant me more abundant graces than the                     ones I wish, hope, and ask.                             I  base  this  unlimited  vow  of  trust  in  your  infinite  goodness  upon  your                     divine  merits,  on  your  most  holy  mother's,  on  the  angels',  and  on  the  saints'                     merits as well as upon the just  and innocent souls.  My Jesus,  please accept this                     vow  and  lock  it  in  your  sweetest,  most  merciful  Heart  as  well  as  in  the  most                     loving, pure  Heart of your most holy mother;  look at this vow  benignly and                     mercifully every time I ask, wish, long for, and cry, but  do not obtain or do not                     seem to obtain the graces I am asking;  look at  this  vow every time your most                     just and holy motives  prevent you from granting what I am asking,  or you do                     otherwise, or I do not understand that you are granting the favors.                             O most loving sweet Heart of Jesus, o most immaculate Heart of Mary,                     be merciful to me and to the persons for whom I  wail, sigh,  and pray!  Have                     mercy!   I am a poor man in need, and my years fail in lamentations, etc.                             Angels  and  saints,  please  have  mercy on me  and  on  my petitions!...                     Celestial friends...  Souls of the just on earth, may your prayers help me. Amen...                     (Vol. 4, page 9l).","The  Father  suggested  the  persons  who  were  worthy  to  make  this  vow.                     Mother Nazzarena was one of them.                             For  some time,  the community of the Holy Spirit was  under continuous                     tests from the Lord, and the Father wrote: \"I fear the community  of the Holy                     Spirit has a hidden sentence to atone  for divine  justice,  and  some persons are                     the  victims!...  Let us praise God, have a confident hope in all events, and renew                     the vow of trust!\" (Vol.  35, page 99). On another occasion: \"You are saying that                     want is felt.  Praised be the Lord! Renew the vow of trust!\" (Vol. 36, page l86).                              The  peasant  Virginia  dell'Aquila  of  Oria  was  living  an  uncommon                     spiritual life.  The Father visited her now and then, exhorting and leading her to                     the perfect surrender to God.  He says:                             I  feel  that  Virginia  fears  for  herself.    Do  you  think  that  Virginia  still                     exists?  I knew she was dead; how is it that she revivifies?  If Virginia is dead,                     she cannot mind her own business.  The  new Virginia has nothing to do with the                     old    one,  who    was    inconsiderate,    always  thinking  of  her  being    saved    or                     damned,  whether  she  was  acceptable  to  God  or  not,  whether  she  was  doing                     God's will or not.  The Virginia full of anxiety is dead. The  new  Virginia  does        183                     not mind herself,  but looks  after  the interests of Jesus' Heart;  she does not                     mind whether she will be saved  or not,  because she surrenders herself into the                     Heart    of  Jesus,    where  none  can  be  lost.    The  new  Virginia  is  thinking  of                     suffering for the conversion of sinners, is praying to win  good workers to the                     holy Church, and is wailing only for the interests of Jesus and of souls (S.C. Vol.                     5, page ll4).                             He answers a desolate letter of Virginia:                             You  write  and  call  yourself  Virginia  wretch.  Please  do  not  apply  to                     yourself the word wretch, because wretch is the devil who has lost for ever the                     grace of God! Perhaps you say:  \"I am a wretch because I have no priest helping                     me.\" Do you mean that Jesus is not enough for you?  What nonsense! Perhaps                     you say: \"I am a wretch because I cannot receive Holy Communion.\" But that is                     God's will, which is better than to receive Holy Communion!  You will  say:  \"I                     do not know if I am doing the will of God.\" If you don't know, it doesn't matter,                     provided that you do it. Where is the holy trust?  Trust in Jesus who loves you so                     much, who wants you crucified out of love; do not wrong him through lack of                     trust. Rejoice instead, and conform to the Lord, being confident, confident, and                     confident. I would like you to make the vow of trust; if you agree, I will mail it to                     you (S.C. Vol. 5, page ll5).","11. I shall never be confused for                            all eternity                                 The  Father  endeavored  to  seek  the  means  for  his  institution;  but  his                     inexhaustible resource was always trust in God.                             He writes:                             \"I have tried several means,  I have knocked at the door  of the rich,  but in                     vain;  for that reason I am running the risk of abandoning these poor children,                     lest I lift up my eyes to the One who also feeds the birds of the air\" (Vol.  4l,                     page 5).                             And the Lord rewarded the trust of his servant.  Writes Father Vitale:                             \"In  the  presence  of  such  moving  charity,   it  is  not surprising  that                     Providence  sometimes  met  the  padre's  needs mysteriously,  especially before          184                     the earthquake when the lack  of help was continual.  Unexpected aids, as we                     read in the story of Cottolengo, happened proportionately at Canon Di Francia’s                     institutions.  Pressed by creditors and hopeless to get human help, several times a                     beneficent secret hand gave him the needed money. On other occasions, when                     our communities needed necessary, unexpected provisions, enough for the poor                     as  well  came  in.  When  abyss  seemed  to  engulf  the  foundation,  the  gap  was                     always filled by divine power! Now and again the help came in a legacy for the                     foundation,  an  unknown person who paid our debt,  or money  was found  in  a                     box...we might call it...a  joke  divine  Providence played on his faithful servant\"                     (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 353).                             Many of his works seemed absurd, and they might be only explained by                     his immense trust in God.  Sometimes   we needed necessities, and he said:  \"Do                     not be afraid, the Lord will provide as he did in the past.\" Due to this, wonders                     happened;  for  instance,  a  letter  with  abundant  money  arrived  to  meet                     unexpectedly","the need of bread on that day.                             The Father himself recognized particular interventions of the Lord since                     the  beginning  of  the  institution.    He  wrote  to  Father  Cusmano:  \"These  little                     institutions are very incipient; we have no income, and live by alms.  Humanly                     speaking  it  seems impossible  to  go forth,  living by the day;  and  yet,  we  see                     miracles  of  divine Providence!\" (S.C. Vol.  7, page 33).  On another occasion:                     \"Even  though  we  are  always  in  debt,  divine  providence  manifests  itself                     portentously\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 36).                             In   l90l,   communicating the names of   the   afflicted institution to the                     sacred  allies,  the  Father  asks  himself:  \"Will  this  little  plant  grow?    Will  it  be                     formed,  becoming  a  tree?  Only  God  knows  that!\"  And  recognizing  his  own                     miseries, he continues: \"If I look at the abyss of my weakness,   I hope nothing                     for its future.  But, if the institution is God's work, his omnipotence will provide                     it with the persons qualified for its formation and stability.  On the ground of its                     means of subsistence, it can last one day, having nothing for tomorrow.  And yet,                     we  held  it  as  a  matter  of  no  importance,  but  sought  the  divine  glory  and  the                     salvation of souls with pure intention (which is a grace of God), holding that the                     institutions are not formed by gold and silver, but by the principles of the fear of      185                     God  and  by  the  Christian  virtues.    Then  he  manifests    God's  intervention  :                     \"However,  the divine Providence that feeds the birds of the air and dresses the                     lilies  in  the  fields,  never  failed us,  providing  us  in  a marvelous way\" (S.C.                     Vol. l0, page ll2).                         12. Some episodes                                First of all let us listen to Msgr.  Joseph Loiacono, archbishop of Ariano                     Irpino,  who  was  a  guest  at  Avignone  for  some  days  in  l90l,  before  being                     consecrated a bishop.                             \"I knew of Canon Di Francia's holiness by repute, and the few days I lived                     together  with  him  confirmed  it.    It  was  a  fortune  for  me  being  present  to  the                     Servant of God's para-liturgy, when he instituted the Rogationists of the Heart                     of Jesus and the","Daughters of Divine Zeal. (2) I am always keeping in mind that service: nothing                     seemed to be terrestrial in that chapel; we felt the supernatural around us.                             The sheltered youth narrated marvels of charity and even miracles... One                     evening the cooks said to him at dinner time:                                 - Father, we have no drop of oil to dress the salad.                                 - Did you check well?                                 - Yes, the oil container is dry.                                 - See again, and check better.                                 Even  though  they  were  sure,  they  obeyed.    Meanwhile,  the  Father                     lifted up his eyes in prayer.  At their coming back the youth said:                                 - Father, there is oil enough in the container.\"                             Teresa, the Servant of God's sister, told us that a fellow once shouted to                     him in the street:  \"I want to be paid today.\"  The Father answered:  \"Today you                     will be paid.  Come over at Brunaccini  palace at 7:00 p. m.\"  He had not even a                     cent, but that day he received abundant alms and kept his word with that fellow.                             When the Father was in need, he often appealed to Our Lady of the Letter,                     going to the cathedral to pray.  Once, after the prayer,   he met near the city fish-                     market a Mr.  Antonino Interdonato,  a  general  contractor  and  a  benefactor  of                     the institute,  who  asked the reason of the Father's affliction  and gave him a bill     186                     of one hundred liras.  Happy,  the Father was  in his  way  home  when he met a                     poor woman crying  for  her  urgent needs,  and  gave  her the bill.  Back to the                     institute, after praying before the Blessed Sacrament the Father was told that  a                     lady had come offering a greater alm.                             Saro  Marchese remembers:                             \"While  talking  with Father Vitale and  Canon  Celona,  the Father  was                     asked  for  78  liras for  an  urgent  need   of  the institute.  Rummaging his                     pockets, Father Vitale scraped together two liras, and the Father said:  'Let the                     children go to the church.'                             He put on surplice and stole, opened the tabernacle, and said some Our                     Fathers.  When the prayers ended, someone rang the front door bell.  The mail                     man delivered an urgent registered wrapper, and the Father gave the two liras as                     a tip to him, who took them only after the Father's insistence, because he knew","Father Di Francia's needs.                             In the wrapper there were two ear rings, an envelope, and a note saying:                     'Place the ear-rings at  the statue of Saint Anthony, and use the  money for the                     orphans.' In the envelope there were 4 golden coins worth 20 liras each.  Thus,                     Saint Anthony provided for the 78 liras plus for the two liras of tip.                             One day, someone knocked at the door of Saint Paschal in Oria.  It was an                     old poor man who was crying at the top of his voice: 'Padre Hannibal, will you                     give me a piece of bread?'...                             The Father went to the refectory...opened the bread chest and asked...'isn't                     there  any  bread?'  'No,  today  brother  Joseph  will  go  to  Ceglie  to  pick  it  up.'  I                     barely had enough to make lunch.  The padre gathered the bread from the table,                     put  it  in  a  basket,  and  gave  it  to  the  poor  man.    I  asked:    'Padre,  when  the                     community comes, what will I give them?'                             He smiled in a friendly way and said: 'How long does it take to prepare                     lunch?'                             'Scarcely a few minutes.' Then he added:  'The Lord will provide us with                     bread.' He left...                                                                        187                            Someone was ringing the bell at the door.  Brother Joseph opened it while                     the church bell was playing Angelus.  A  woman carrying  a  basket  of warm                     bread asked the brother to  have  it blessed by Padre Hannibal;  she would take                     two loaves  only;  the remaining  was for the orphans\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di                     Francia, page 354).                             Referring to the early years of the institute, the Father said that once he                     had to pay the rent of Avignone little houses, and he had no money.                             \"Give me at least 200 liras\" said Donna Anna, the dues collector.  And the                     Father: \"Come back in about an hour.\" As soon as the lady went away, Msgr.                     Guarino's butler came in with 200 liras sent by Francis II, the former king of the                     Two Sicilies, who was in Berlin in exile.  The Father had written to him, and the                     money arrived at the proper time.                             Sister  Gertrude  says  that  she  entered  the  institute  of  the  Daughters  of                     Divine  Zeal  after  hearing  the  following  wonder  from  Miss  Biotti  Carlotta  of                     Messina, a teacher in Lipari. The fact is this: when the suppliers decided to give                     the  Father  no  credit  any  longer,  the  Servant  of  God  collected  his  thoughts  in                     prayer. When he went to the suppliers, he found out that his debts had been paid                     by an unknown person and he took the payment receipt.                             Sister Veronica Briguglio, she was then the mother superior,","confirmed the above episode to Sister Gertrude.  Father Cama of Messina knew                     of it from his late brother Dominic, who was a cleric at Avignone in that time,                     and narrated it to me.                            It seems that such a wonder happened more than once.                             These facts may be explained by the intervention of generous benefactors,                     such  as  Ciampa,  Costa    Saya,    Interdonato...    who  remained    anonymous.                     However it may be, the divine providence intervened.                             Francis  De Gregorio has been a doorkeeper at the  institute for  a few                     decades;  his  reports date back at the time he was  a candidate to religious life:                     \"We were lacking money and food; the Servant  of  God  went out for begging,                     but returned  tired  and empty-handed,  while  we  were  in  the  church  praying                     on  his exhortation.  Suddenly, the doorkeeper handles to him a letter delivered                     by an unknown person:  there was money in.  The Father, however, was unable                     TO thank him, because he had already disappeared.                             Because the clothes of children ran short, the Father told them to pray the                     Madonna. Suddenly a load of clothes sent by a charitable lady came in:  sheets,                     shirts, linen, an iron bed, and four matresses.  While we were busy putting them                     in order, also a load of paste sent by another lady came in.                              188                             One   day a supplier went to the Father shouting and threatening.  The                     Servant  of  God  tried  to  keep  him  calm,  telling  him  to  be  confident  in  divine                     providence.  While the creditor was still with the Father, a letter was delivered.                     The Father opened it; there was money enough in it to pay off the creditor.                             One  morning  of  May  in  the  chapel,  the  Father  drew  the  slip  which                     indicated  the  act  of  mortification  on  that  day.    It  was  written:    \"Hear  mass                     kneeling, with eyes cast down, and joined palms.\"  He commented: \"I am in need                     of money; someone is willing to lend it to me, but he demands a guarantee which                     I cannot offer.  You perform this act of mortification well, because this is the best                     guarantee.\" The children paid full attention while making the penance.  The same                     day, the person gave the money to the Father without any guarantee.                             One evening in l90l, the Father gathered the little children and said:  \"I                     need a great sum of money; each of you should ask the Madonna for 50 liras...\"                     The following day the Father returned to the institute of the Holy Spirit and said:                     \"Children, the","first  50  liras  have  already  come;  who  of  you  prayed fervently?  \"   The                     following  day  he  went  again  to  the  children  showing  a  heavy  envelope  and                     saying:  \"Children, what is inside here?\"  All together they shouted:  \"50 liras.\"  -                     No! - Said the Father -There are all the 50 liras you asked from the Madonna...                     Actually, 50 liras still want...  for sure one of you did not pray well...  go ahead                     confidently!     The remnant 50 liras came that day.   Later,  the  Father told the                     children that the man who delivered the big envelope was unknown to him!                             Sometimes  the  Father  took  in  his  lap  a  three  or  four  year  old  orphan,                     telling him: \"Let us pray the Madonna; she hears you. We have nothing to eat.\"                     The  child  joined  the  hands  in  attitude  of  prayer  saying  a  Hail  Mary,  and  the                     Madonna provided according to the need.                            Teacher Gazzara writes:                             \"One day, almost crying, the Father said to a group of little orphans in my                     presence:    'today  you  have  nothing  to  eat.  Come  with  me  in  the  chapel!'  I                     followed them.  They prayed with raised   hands   to the Sacred Heart of Jesus                     through   the intercession of Saint Anthony.  Not even half an hour had passed                     when a load of tuna fish came in. It was sent by a person unknown to me.  Later                     it came to my knowledge that bread, paste, and oil turned up in abundance.\"                             The same teacher writes that he met the Father in Cavour Boulevard in              189                     April l90l, and while walking with him the Father said:  \"How much I have to                     praise the Lord for the graces he has granted to me, a poor minister! I went up the                     stair of a rich man and  knocked at his door.  As soon as he opened the door and                     saw me, he slammed the door at my face:  but a helping hand will always appear                     for my orphans.  In that moment a person approaches him, kisses the Father's                     hand, and places a bill of fifty liras in it.                              Francis Langher of Roccalumera was a guest in Avignone as a student.                     He reports the following episode which   happened in l889. One day the baker                     called upon the Father insistently for an account of at least 300 liras upon his                     credit so that he might pay a bill expiring that day.                             The  Father  said:    \"Today,  the  capital  of  the  community  amounts  to  20                     cents.  However,  you  wait for a while because the children will  pray to Saint                     Joseph, who will provide.                             The baker sat down nervously not knowing whether he should go away or                     wait...  The Father along with the community was praying in the chapel.  After                     about 20 minutes, he was called","to the door.  Two French officers, a master mariner and his vice-mariner declared                     that they were caught by a storm in the open sea and had pledged 300 liras for                     alms in the first city they would enter, if the Lord had saved them. They were                     keeping their word, happy to help a French institution.  The Father explained to                     them that his name was Di Francia, but he was not a French man.  Both of them,                     however,  concluded:  \"If  the  Lord  led  us  here,  it  means  this  is  his  will,\"  and                     handled 300 liras.  Thus, also the baker learned to trust in Providence.                             We  close  this  chapter  with  two  episodes  narrated  by  Joseph,  Father                     Bonarrigo's  nephew,  who  lived  in  Avignone  four-five  years.  One  day,  after                     returning empty handed from the city, the Father had the work in the laboratories                     stopped, and gathered all in the chapel to pray for the daily food.  At midday                     sharp, the postman delivers a registered letter with l00 liras inside.  It was sent                     from Belgium by a lady who had visited the institute some time before.                             The  following  painful  episode  leads  us  to  think  of  God's  mercy,  which                     prevails over everything.                             The Father had borrowed a sum of money and signed a bill. He hoped to                     pay it with the aid granted to him by the city hall. When the bill expired, the                     Father begged the creditor to renew it for a few days, waiting for the city hall's                     payment.  But the creditor flew into a passion and threatened with dishonoring            190                     the bill.                             Back  home,  the  creditor  shouted  like  a  possessed  man,  crying  that  the                     following  day  would  be  one  of  battle,  as  his  relatives  said...    Unluckily,  the                     following  day  never  rose  for  that    poor  man,  because  he  died  in  the  night  by                     apoplectic stroke.                          Notes                              (l)      Speaking    of    the    difficulties    hindering    the    Pious  Institution's                     development,   the  Father   wrote:   \"The   four difficulties,  which  surrounded this                     little  charitable  institute  since  its  start,  have  been  growing,  always  with  more                     complication","of things and the interlacing of circumstances. The institute has been surrounded by a                     vortex of tribulations which brought it  at the point of death a hundred times before                     being completely  born. How many times I felt myself exclaiming, 'The waters went                     over my head;  I said: I am lost'\" (Jer. Lam. 3, 54). (S.C. Vol. l0, page 2ll).

Holiness is charity                               Charity is the queen and mother of all virtues. \"It contains and summarizes the                     perfections  in  such  a  way  that  not  even  one  virtue  can  be  achieved  perfectly                     without charity.  Like cement  and lime tie the stones in  the walls  making the                     building  stand,  like  the  muscles  and  sinews  tie  the  body  avoiding  its                     decomposition, so charity ties the virtues, which cannot stand without it\" (Saint                     Francis of Sales, Theot. book XI, ch. 9). Saint Augustin wrote: \"Initial charity is                     initial  holiness;  advanced  charity  is  advanced  holiness;  great  charity  is  great                     holiness; perfect charity is perfect holiness\" (De natura et gratia, ch. 70, no. 84).                     Saint  Thomas  Aquinas  states:  \"The  perfection  of  Christian  life  lies  in  the                     charity, first in God's love, second in the love for neighbor\" (IIa IIae, q. l84                     art. 3). Our Lord said: \"On these two commandments the whole law is based, and                     the prophets as well\" (Mt. 22, 40).                       The Father writes,                          \"Everything must begin from love, because God's love gives a priceless value                     to our actions. Love teaches perfection, and everything done without love is lost.                     Love forms the pure intention, makes us work for God, his glory, and his honor,           194                     and makes us be grateful to him for his divine benefits, above all for the benefits                     of Jesus Christ's divine redemption.                          Pure  love  urges  us  to  love  God  for  himself  more  than  for  his  binding                     commandment to love him, or for the many goods deriving from such a love.                     This pure love is the perfection of charity and the image of the love with which                     the Blessed in heaven love God... All of us must long for it. May pure love be the                     best of the religious practices;  may  it imbue our  minds, our wills, our  hearts\"                     (S.C. Vol. l0, page l83).                           Let us look at the Father's love for God.","2. God deserves our love                              The  Father  taught  us  the  love  for  God  by  word  and  example  preaching  the                     Lord's beauty and infinite kindness, and pointing out that life without love for                     God is barren and lacking all good. He wrote:                           May  our  life  be  a  continuous  effort  to  love  God  our  Lord,  Creator  and                     Redeemer,  with  a  predominant,  strong,  tender,  constant,  fervent,  active,                     compassionate,  effective,  and  uniting  love  (Vol.  3,  page  l66).  God  is  infinite                     beauty! God is infinite goodness, and we must love him. He holds all perfections,                     beauties, treasures, which we are unable to understand. If we look at nature, we                     see  a  faintest  image  of  the  divine  properties.  Let  us  look  at  space:  it  is  so                     immense that the human mind cannot compute it; still, God is more. Look at the                     stars: they are millions and millions and many of them are greater than earth a                     hundred thousand times; suspended in the empty space, they orbit with admirable                     order, still they cannot express how powerful God is, because he created them                     with a word and he is able to create as many of them as he wants. Look at nature:         195                     how many beauties it has! Beautiful is spring, fragrant the flowers, majestic the                     mountains, pretty the creeks, pleasant the fields, mysterious the graves, terrible                     the oceans: how  much beauty and variety  the  author of them holds! (Vol.  23,                     page l5).                          The virtues of the saints come from God, who is infinite goodness. He shows                     himself  to  the  blessed  ones  who  see  him  face  to  face,  experiencing  a  loving                     happiness that differs from one another. Without lessening himself, he rewards                     the  merits  of  the  elect  by  making  them  contemplate  himself  for  ever  without                     growing weary as eternally new, despite his being all the same. They love him                     because he is worthy of being loved, not because they take pleasure in loving the                     infinite goodness. Even though he would make them suffer eternally, they would                     continue loving him.                          Now, then, if God is infinite goodness holding the wholeness of beauty and                     greatness, does he not deserve our love? (Vol. 23, page l6).","3. Happy the person who loves God!                              Desiring that all of his children love the Lord, the Father continues:                           Which  merciless  heart  will  deny  love  to  God?  Poor  creatures!  They  love                     everything but God! And yet, earthly loves are vain, are nothing.  Look at  the                     world  and  show  me  what  God's  creatures  love.  Some  love  money,  others                     clothing; some food, others property and wealth; some conversation, others glory                     and  honor;  some  love  creatures;  and  with  what  profane  love,  transport,  and                     passion they love them! Ah! The main loves blinding human beings are loves of                     self-interest and of creatures. How do they sacrifice themselves for the sake of                     self-interest and of creatures! They spend nights, face risks, struggle for a living,                     swear, work, and endanger their life! They declare to live for each other, to share                     the  days,  the  pains,  the  sufferings  of  their  life!  People  go  so  far  as  to  idolize                     creatures!                          But happy is the person who is penetrated by the sparkle of divine love; happy                     is  the  person  that  out  of  love  lives  with  great  transport,  loving  the  Creator  in                     creatures: instead of loving self-interest, he loves the king of all treasures, instead   196                     of loving vanity, he loves the eternal truth! Happy is the person who says to the                     world:  \"Treacherous  world,  you  do  not  suit  me!  You  have  nothing  else  but                     tribulation and bitterness; I have drunk from your cup experiencing how bitter it                     is; I do not love you, I do not surrender my heart to you; on the contrary, I love                     Jesus, I want to surrender my heart to Jesus.","4. Love of God in all of his works                              Through preaching, prayers, and exhortations, the Father urges us to praise,                     bless,  and  adore  the  divine  attributes;  through  the  prayer  of  the  first  fruit  he                     teaches us to begin the new year by praising God's omnipotence, mercy, wisdom,                     providence, and divine perfections. He insists that we should never forget God's                     love for us, which reveals itself in all works.                           When we consider that God loved us with eternal charity, our mind is moved,                     our heart is touched. We were not yet born nor our parents nor our forefathers,                     and God was loving us. Neither earth nor the sky nor the stars existed, and God                     was loving us.                          Do you think God was in need of us, poor creatures? Wasn't he fully happy                     without us? Being all the same fully happy,  God did not need  us,  nor was he                     obliged to love or create us; and yet, he loved our souls so much that he not only                     created, but also redeemed us. He made us in his image and when we lost his                     image because of sin, he sent his only son on earth to redeem us. What does this                     most benign Lord demand of us for his love? Nothing else but love!                                                                                                               197                      5. Pure love                              The Blessed Thomas of Jesus, in \"The Anguishes of Our Lord,\" asks the Lord                     for  a  sparkle  of  love. The  Father  erased  the  word  'sparkle'  from  his  book  and                     replaced it with a fire.' A fire of love! This was his eagerness, his longing!                          Since his early years he nourished an ardent love for God.                          When he graduated from college, he  made himself so conspicuous in piety                     and  virtue  that  his  confessor  gave  him  the  permission  to  receive  holy                     Communion every day at the age of l7, which was very rare in those times. Still,                     he did not yet feel, nor","he foresaw the divine call which was to snatch him from the world, some year                     later.                          On  the  contrary,  at  a  certain  moment  he  deemed  he  had  to  form  his  own                     family. Father Vitale has it:                        “In  his  early  youth,  thought  about  his  destiny  sometimes  crossed  his  mind.                     And  although  he  was  filled  with  holy  affection,  his  heart  was  touched                     momentarily by an earthly creature. Later on, he paid for this indulgence very                     dearly in his spiritual life; he had a lasting fear that he had shared the heart with                     which had been so close to God with the world for a few moments of his life\"                     (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page l8).                          But  there  was  no  sharing  of  his  heart;  at  l8  years  of  age,  our  youth  began                     thinking of his destiny. Feeling no special call from the Lord, he deemed that the                     common  way  of  life  was  open  to  him.  God,  however,  made  himself  felt  at  a                     certain moment. The Father said that his vocation was a sudden one; when he did                     not expect it, God spoke to his heart, and he became sure that the Lord had called                     him to the ecclesiastical vocation.                          Our young poet could not help hinting at this fleeting period of his life when                     he  composed  the  marvelous  poem  on  the  death  of  the  illustrious  Taccone                     Gallucci's younger sister Carolina:                                                       198                                            Oh! If you loved! I would tell you: happy,                                           You who girded divine wings                                           before a grievous disenchantment withered                                           The flower of your beauty!                                           Fortunate, I would say; deceitful                                           Dream is life, a fleeting show                                           that the flattery of love represents                                           By fanciful colors; if you draw near                                           To pin down the undaunted, and serene,                                           You'd see naked the whole                                           Charm, that the ingenuous eyes enticed...                                           Trust me, to whom the mystery of a precocious love                                           Was understood while drinking                                           From the gentle opening breeze of youth,                                           Me, that, made ill and deserted, started back                                           To the friendly shadow of the altars, weeping.                           Perhaps  this  is  the  unknown  anguish  which  he  expressed  in  these  verses                     honoring the Madonna della Mutata.","In the innermost fibre                                           Of my afflicted heart                                           Is a pain to all unknown                                           Is a suffering unexplored;                                           No sight of creature                                           Can this dark shadow feature.                           In the poem \"To Immaculate Mary,\" published in The Catholic Word, when                     he was only seventeen, the poet laments his errors:                                            I too weep at your feet, O Mary,                                           In the suffering of my disenchantment:                                           How many errors, inside of me                                           Embitter the life of my soul!                                           But in the flower of my years,                                           Kneeling at your holy knees                                           I sought you with tears in my eyes,                                           There I found the cross and the altar!                           The episode did not upset the serenity of his spirit, nor did it block his way to                     holiness.                                                                                 199                          He pledged always to improve his love for the Lord, loving him the best he                     could, and turning his life to an ever increasing act of love for God.                          On one occasion he entered a class of children who were learning the verb to                     be. He suddenly applied the lesson to God who is the being and love we must                     adore and love. He made a meditation on it suitable to the children's minds, who                     never forgot it.                          God's love was his life. He spoke of it with great fervor, sharing his flames of                     love  with  his  listeners.  His  institutions  show  the  mark  of  this  love,  which                     transpired from his speaking, praying, walking, and acting.                          He spread this love all his life long with his example, his writings, his works                     of charity, and the religious congregations he founded.                          Father Vitale writes:                           “Our padre strove to possess the pure divine love. We perceived his striving                     from  the  acts  of  his  private  life  and  from  his  ardent  cares  and  continuous                     concerns that no worldly spirit nor human interest entered our congregations...                     He wished each member of his communities to seek God alone, following his                     example  and  teaching.  When  he  met  simple  persons  not  at  all  allured  by  the                     world, he was very pleased. He thought","that these persons attracted the blessing of God on his institution.                          He used to say: whoever seeks God is humble, simple, and docile; he is not                     cunning, nor is he a liar, nor he feigns. On the contrary, he puts himself in the                     hands of the superiors to be molded as wax.                          Still a cleric, I began to associate with the Father. He showed me his orphans                     in the Avignone quarter and explained his ideals to me, concluding: “In short,                     here we seek God and paradise.” As a matter of fact, the aim of his institutions is                     summed up in seeking God and paradise.                          Animated with divine love, he never sought money to increase the institute's                     capital,  not  even  when  it  was  easy  to  do  so,  because  he  feared  to  surpass                     Providence's limits; nor he sought licit human help apart from the pure glory of                     God.                          Considering  how  vast  was  the  institute's  mission  he  had  undertaken,  he                     sometimes  exclaimed:  “Oh,  where  I  plunged  into!  I  wonder  whether  I  am                     pleasing the Lord!”                          When the Father saw wise, devout persons becoming sad for being insulted by                     the world, he mildly recalled them to seek only the pure love of God.                          In his several misfortunes he used to exclaim: -Let us seek God and look at                     him alone.                          This pure love of God explains his constancy and untroubled mind in every                     circumstance.                                                                             200                          We will be happy, if we imitate our good Father!\" (Bulletin l93l, page 35).                         6. Hate for sin                            Since our Lord said: \"If you love me and obey the commands I give you...(Jn.                     l4, l5), as well as: \"You are my friends if you do what I command you\" (Jn. l5,                     l4), true love of God cannot confine itself to words.  Whoever wants to love the                     Lord, should pledge to avoid anything which is against his holy law, even in the                     least; therefore, he must hate sin, striving to avoid even the least faults.","This is a subject we must talk about. \"Our society has lost the awareness of                     sin. If some trace is surviving, people try to suffocate it. Modern man does not                     want to feel a sinner; he wants instead to combine any action with tolerance and                     permission, following the permissive morals, which aim at freeing man from the                     bonds  imposed  by  moralists,  canonists,  and  ascetics\"  (L'Osservatore  Romano,                     Feb. l8, l972). People do not touch upon the subject of sin, nor do they want to                     listen to it: \"Sin is a silenced word; modern persons avoid the consideration of                     sin  and  do  not  speak  of  it.  Sin  seems  an  obsolete,  unbecoming  word\"  (Ibid.                     March  9,  l972).  And  yet,  sin  \"is  the  human  beings'  calamitous  drama,  which                     modern lax morals want to deprive of seriousness\" (Ibid. July 20, l972). This is                     Paul  VI's  teaching.  On  its  part,  the  Second  Vatican  Council  teaches  that  \"the                     faithful still strive to conquer sin and increase in holiness. And so they turn their                     eyes to Mary who shines forth to the whole community of the elect as the model                     of the virtues\" (L.G. no. 65).                          Fight against sin is a fundamental pledge of the Father.                          Naturally, he too paid his tribute to human weakness, and he himself writes:                     \"Only a creature, whose virtues were the abyss of all perfections, was free from                     the  lightest  imperfection.  This  creature  was  the  Mother  of  God\"  (S.C.  Vol.  8,                     page 62). More or less, the other human beings feel the effects of the original sin.                     The Father, however, acknowledged that his faults never reached mortal sin by                     the grace of God.                                                                         201                          On February l0, l927, during his last sickness, the Father confided to me:                           I review in my mind the innumerable faults I have committed in my life, even                     though I think they are not mortal, by the grace of the Lord. But who can weigh                     the malice of a fault?  The Lord lets me know my faults up to sixty years ago,                     and how all of them were punished; furthermore, the Lord made me understand                     the specific punishments which purified me of specific defects. For this reason I                     recall  the  words  of  the  Bible:  \"If  the  spirit  of  the  Lord  is  upon  you,  do  not                     abandon it; you will be purified of your sins.\" And yet, we must always confide                     in our Lord.                           A  lively,  bellicose  nature  engaged  the  Father  in  a  close  fight;  but  his  long                     practice of the virtue made him prevail over nature, and when an instinctive act                     overtook him, he quickly took remedial measures.                          For instance, one early morning the Father left; he returned some hours later                     to say mass. On the preceding evening he had","had a talk with a Mr. Ando', and both of them had raised the voice; but they left                     greeting each other sincerely. However, the following morning the Father went                     to beg pardon from that gentleman before saying mass, in case he had offended                     or scandalized him. Since he was not at home, the Father traced him in the city.                     Mr.  Ando'  went  to  Father  Vitale  and  told  him  the  story:  \"What  is  Father  Di                     Francia thinking of...?  Absolutely nothing happened...\"                          For sure, the Father wrestled continuously against his defects, and we have                     already quoted some of his resolutions he made over and over again.                          The Father was confident in the Lord that he could succeed in avoiding sin                     and wrote beautiful prayers to obtain such a grace. We report one of them:                          To the crucified Jesus:                           O my crucified goodness, I do not want, not even in the least, to offend your                     heart, which is an infinite abyss of love and sorrow! My bad behavior scandalizes                     my neighbor, prevents the sanctification of souls, and tortures your divine heart!                     My Jesus, may such impiousness never happen again! My crucified Lord, for the                     sake of your holy wounds grant me the favor of taking away any sin from me,                     even the venial ones. I will do my penance, even a double one! See to it that from                     now on I avoid even the lightest imperfection, which afflicts your beloved heart                     and  scandalizes  my  neighbor.  I  am  ready  to  suffer  a  double  pain  for  the  sins                     which your infinite kindness will hinder me from committing! My crucified love,           202                     I have tortured your heart too much, becoming an obstacle to my brethren! Not to                     hurt you, I wish I had never been born.  You love me since eternity, and out of                     love you created and redeemed me! O infinite kindness, you are omnipotent!  For                     the sake of yourself, please work this miracle in my soul.                          Please do so for the most holy cross on which you died offering yourself to                     the Father; work this miracle for these very sharp nails, which perforated your                     hands and feet; for these very sharp thorns, which pierced your most innocent                     head; for this loving wound of your heart, which is a well of infinite charity; and                     for your most precious blood, which cries for mercy. Work this miracle for the                     sake of the most holy Mary in sorrow, and for the agony that her immaculate                     heart suffered at the foot of the cross! My crucified Jesus, for the sake of Saint                     John, Saint Magdalene, and Saint John of the cross who asked and obtained this                     grace  from  you,(l)  hear  me,  hear  me;  grant  me  the  grace  I  am  ardently                     beseeching! Amen. Amen (Vol. 6, page l26).","Also,  we  have  a  prayer  for  daily  behavior,  in  which  the  Father  implores  an                     effective grace to avoid offending the Lord during the day. (2)                          Because he was very vigilant to avoid sin at any rate, the witnesses almost                     unanimously affirm that they never saw any fault in him.                        7. \"This man lives in God!\"                              Whether the Father had received or not the grace granted to Saint John, it was                     a  firm  belief  of  those  who  were  at  home  with  him  that  he  kept  his  baptismal                     innocence.  Father  Vitale  knew  him  better  than  any  one,  and  he  repeated  over                     again that he never noticed moral faults in him. He used to say: \"He had his own                     miseries, but I think he never committed deliberate faults.\"                          It  is  not  surprising.  The  theologians  teach  that  due  to  human  weakness  the                     perfect persons are unable to avoid human miseries, but they succeed to avoid the                     deliberate venial sins by a special grace of God,                          Let  us  call  to  mind  the  episode  of  Hannibal's  early  youth  when  he  went                     hunting together with an uncle of his. They came across a friend who asked how                     long their hunt had lasted. The uncle answered: \"We were only out for an hour             203                     and all we hit was a blackbird in flight.\" Mary Hannibal added: \"Our hunt began                     at three a.m., and we shot the bird on the branch of a fig tree!\" His uncle said                     nothing,  but  after  they  left  he  scolded  his  nephew  for  his  embarassing                     corrections.  Narrating  the  episode,  the  padre  added:  \"You  see  what  the  world                     does; it teaches us to lie!\"                          Concerning  lies,  the  Father  said  that  he  had  received  from  the  Lord  the                     instinct to always say the truth. Lie appeared to him so strange that he did not                     suppose  it  even  in  others;  for  instance,  he  believed  in  the  innocence  of  a                     shoemaker, because the shoemaker asserted it. He admitted no lies, not even by                     joke, and was so strict on this point that he dismissed a candidate to religious life                     because she did not amend such a defect in a certain period of time.","One day during the recreation, a boy shouted to his playmate: \"Lie, lie!\"  The                     Father came out of his room and asked: \"Who said the word lie?  You should say                     'It is not so,' otherwise you suppose the intention of cheating in your fellow, and                     that's not good.\"                          I remember an exhortation to a mother superior: \"For goodness' sake, may no                     one tell lies, nor be false, but all of them be sincere and simple, because lies ruin                     souls!\" (S.C. Vol. 8, page 208).                          He was untiring in recommending the superiors to prevent disorders, which                     remove the blessings of God from the communities. A former cleric recalled the                     Father that near to death with opened arms exhorted to avoid sin as the greatest                     evil with grave, solemn voice: \"When there is no sin, we have nothing to fear,                     and Providence will never fail.\"                          He almost never talked to the communities about mortal sin, but insisted on                     avoiding the venial ones and the defects.                          He really feared venial sins, and said: \"Who can understand crimes? Venial                     sins  are  conducive  to  serious  disorders  which  we  don't  even  suppose;  they                     displease God, and we have to avoid them.\" While talking, he had wet eyes and                     trembling voice.                          We  also  deduced  his  hatred  toward  sin  from  his  suffering  because  of  the                     defects in his community; he turned so grave and serious as to change the color                     in his face, becoming also uncompromising. He demanded the acknowledgment                 204                     and the amendment of the fault. Says Father Vitale:                           The Father was jealously watchful in avoiding voluntary defects, and who has                     been in confidence with him knows the miniature of his conscience and his fear                     of offending the Lord even with the lightest faults. And yet, he used to say that                     he drank iniquities as water, and reminded us of how the Lord demands  a perfect                     correspondence from the souls committed to perfection and of how he seriously                     punishes their little defects.                          The  writer  remembers  in  details  the  padre's  marvelous  preaching  on  little                     defects  during  the  retreat  at  the  seminary.  How  many  times  he  repeated  the                     following words of the scripture: \"Who despises little things, falls down, little by                     little.\" He made us understand the ugliness of pardonable sins. Then he was a                     young  priest,  an  imaginative  poet  with  deep  scriptural  insight  who  had  an                     incisive  way  of  his  own  in  doing  meditation.  The  spiritual  persons  who                     approached  him  used  to  say:  \"This  man  is  full  with  God,  he  lives  in  God!\"                     (Bulletin, l933, page 269).","8.  A Miniature                               We report a significant episode. In l924, while unloading papers, a worker of                     the  building  company  had  a  grave  accident  which  fractured  his  backbone.  In                     those  days  the  reform  of  the  social  laws  was  applied  through  the  insurance.                     People feared big fines, or arrest... For this reason the lawyer and professionals                     consulted by Father Vitale made told him to record the worker in the books of                     our  typography.  The  Father  knew  the  case  in  the  late  evening,  and  on  the                     following morning, before saying mass, he went to the insurance office declaring                     that the worker was not a printer but a worker of the building company. He was                     registered in the insurance book after the accident. Then he went to Father Vitale                     saying: \"I couldn't rest tonight! How can we permit falsehood? God is displeased.                     Besides, I am the director, and I will face the consequences. If it is a matter of                     prison, it is my business.\" As a matter of fact, nothing happened because there                     was  no  malice,  nor  anything  against  the  law.  The  worker  was  called  for  an                     emergency work, once. But here the point is that the Father was disposed to face                     prison instead of telling a lie!                          Speaking of the Father's soul, Father Vitale defines it a miniature.                          It is a very successful definition. The visitors to the museum who caught a          205                     glimpse of the miniatures' wonders in the codices, appreciate the richness of art,                     the mastery of work, the great value of treasures. These are compressed in a few                     centimeter squares of parchment. They tell us about the study, the patience, and                     the punctual cares of the monks who created them.                          The Father is a great miniaturist. With the help of God's grace he has worked                     patiently  and  constantly  on  his  soul,  making  it  a  very  precious  miniature.  He                     sifted all the throbs of his soul in the presence of God, enriching  and  making                     them precious with God's love.                          The miniature can be adequately appreciated through an accurate observation                     of  its  details:  the  design  and  the  color  appear  in  their  wonderful  beauty;  the                     purest  blue,  the  gold,  and  silver  stand  out  in  the  dazzling  brilliance  of  an                     enchanting picture. Ancient people were right when they described the action of                     the miniature by saying alluminare, that is to say, giving light to the design, to                     the figure.                          The more we study the Father, the more his figure appears","brilliant to us in the light of his heroic virtues and in the wonders of his spiritual                     finesse.                          Precision  and  daintness  are  the  feature  of  the  miniature:  precision  and                     daintness about virtues we have to admire and learn from the Father.                          Accustomed to seek spiritual finesse in his innermost, he deemed to correct                     the lightest defects, which are usually unnoticed.                          The  Father  also  wanted  to  avoid  some  expressions  of  common  use,  which                     were improper to his spiritual finesse.                          \"Woe to those who dared to say things like, “poor devil, deuce, curse, bad                     fate, and the like.” He disliked hearing pejorative words even about the weather!                     He said: “Speaking badly is negative; it is not good. The elements of nature are                     creations  of  God,  and  even  though  they  seem  severe,  they  still  do  God's  will.                     Why complain then?” No one heard an improper word from his mouth\" (Father                     Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 308).                          We conclude with a sister's witness, giving it an explanation. She stated: \"The                     Father  abhorred  any  imperfection.  When  he  happened  to  notice  even  a  slight                     fault, he exclaimed: “My goodness! What is it you have done? You must confess                     it!”  And he also sent us to beg pardon from the mother superior.\"                          This testimony does not affirm that the Father was having scruples, or was                     leading souls in the wrong way. He considered the venial deliberate sins as grave                     with respect to perfection, as he himself explains: \"I say grave, but not mortal\"         206                     (S.C. Vol. 5, page 224). Discussing the subject of confession, he makes clear his                     thought:  \"Theologically  speaking,  venial  sins  are  not  a  necessary  topic  of                     confession; but a person who wants to belong entirely to God; who wants to feel                     the horror of the offense to God; who wants to amend any imperfection and bad                     habit; who absolutely wants to avoid any slackening, and wants to grow in the                     love of Jesus and in the religious virtues; this person should consider venial sins                     very seriously with respect to perfection\" (Vol. l, page l4). Obviously, the Father                     strove to infuse a great dread of any fault, however slight it was.                          It is fixed in my mind what the Father said every time he left. We ran around                     him  to  receive  his  blessing;  he  exhorted  us  briefly  and  fervently  to  do  good,                     always  insisting  upon  the  holy  fear  of  God  and  hatred  of  sin,  quoting  Tobit:                     \"Through all your","days, my son, keep the Lord in mind, and suppress every desire to sin or to break                     his commandments\" (Tb. 4, 5). His eyes wet, he repeated it with grief-stricken                     voice and a characteristic vibration I cannot forget. To obtain from the Lord the                     grace to avoid sin, he ordered his community to say an ejaculatory prayer at the                     beginning and the end of their staying in the church:  \"Lord Jesus, free us from                     any mortal and venial sin.\"                        9. Always alert in preventing sin                              The pledge to prevent sin at any cost originates from our hatred of it. Deeply                     afflicted by the soldiers' blasphemies during the l9l5-l8 European war, the Father                     wrote a letter to General Cadorna, begging him to stop such an impiety, which                     was a challenge to the God of armies. I have read this letter, but unfortunately it                     has been lost.                          The Father confided his deadly grief with a Rogationist who was in the army                     and complained to him for the dirty and blasphemous environment in which he               207                     was living:                           Unfortunately, it is true what you wrote to me, and God knows what heavy                     blows my heart suffers when I hear such horrendous blasphemies, which I shrink                     from writing. It causes a most bitter pain to me; I would like to die instead of                     hearing the most adorable name of God profaned. Therefore, let us bless God's                     name in our hearts, let us atone for such impiety and iniquity of many reckless                     who lead a frivolous, scandalous life even when facing death, when they should                     ask God for pardon! I repeat, let us pray and atone for it as much as we can with                     our good works (Vol. 4l, page l33).                           Let us report some examples to show how the Father always found a way to                     warn the blasphemer.                          Msgr. Di Tommaso, Bishop of Oria, related that the Father abhorred sin even                     when it was committed by others, and greatly suffered in hearing God's name                     profaned.  Passing  through  a  street  of  Oria,  he  once  heard  a  man  blaspheming                     while  squabbling  with  another  man.  The  Servant  of  God  approached  the                     blasphemer, placed his hand on the blasphemer's mouth, and kept him silent.","The man was confused, began kissing the Father's hand, and asked him to pray                     for forgiveness.                          Canon  Celona  reports:  \"We  were  walking  together  when  the  Father                     approached  a  blasphemer,  warning  him  fraternally.  That  man  begged  pardon                     saying, \"Excuse me, Father, I did not see you.\"                          Father Ruggeri relates: \"I was offering my arm to the Servant of God in Oria                     because of his feeble legs, when some men cursed behind us. As though pricked                     by a knife, he winced back imploring them not to curse. We continued our way                     saying prayers.\" The Father hated sin, and when he heard someone cursing, he                     always approached and warned him mildly not to do so. The blasphemer calmed                     down quickly, begging pardon from him and from God. I happened to see that in                     the streets many times.                          \"After  listening  to  his  preaching,  especially  in  the  Annunciation  Church,  I                     came to know how much he suffered because of the many blasphemies, and how                     he warned sinners not to offend God, also because of the tremendous scourges                     with which God would punish humankind, according to what Melanie (3) had                     confided to him.\"                          I remember an episode narrated by Professor Favarolo.                          He  was  traveling  to  Taormina  together  with  the  Father  on  business  of  the                     religious community in that town, when a passenger suddenly cursed. The Father                     got up quickly and with energetic gesture shouted out aloud to the blasphemer:            208                     \"Only God is holy!\" Every one kept silent up to the next station.                          A  daughter  of  a  blasphemer  told  me  that  the  Servant  of  God  once  calmed                     down her father who was cursing in Messina station for having lost something.                     Our Padre gave him all he had in the bag, took him home, and gave him a bottle                     of wine and the sum of money he had lost.                          Because the Father thought that the reason of cursing was misery, he used to                     intervene  with  charity. \"He  suffered for sins, and when he heard cursing,  was                     grieved  and  exclaimed:  “My  God!  My  God!  My  God!  The  Heart  of  Jesus  is                     pierced.”  He  demanded  atonement,  calmed  down  the  blasphemers  mildly,  and                     gave  money,  in  case  of  need.\"  \"Often  some  driver  who  blasphemed  was                     approached  by  the  Servant  of  the  Lord,  who  asked  him  for  repentance  and                     amendment, with good results. Because he","thought that the ordinary cause of the offense to God was misery,  he took care of                     the material situation to reach the soul quickly and positively.\" \"He exhorted us                     very often and warmly to receive the poor with charity in order to avoid that they                     might offend the Lord in case we dealt with them roughly.\" \"One day a water                     bearer  slipped,  broke  the  barrel,  hurt  his  leg,  and  cursed.  The  Servant  of  God                     warned him severely, threatening him with divine punishments. I told the water                     bearer who that priest was, so he begged pardon. The Servant of God dried the                     blood with his handkerchief, took him to Frasti's pharmacy, and asked how much                     was the price of the barrel, which was five liras. Then he gave l0 liras for two                     barrels and five liras for his rest.\"                          Since the Servant of God's charity was well known, some people exploited                     him by threatening with curses, thus compelling him to give money in order to                     avoid sin.                          The  railroad  switchman  Bonsanto  of  Oria  was  an  habitual  blasphemer.                     Knowing the Father's hatred of curse and his pecuniary generosity to avoid sin,                     he cursed in his presence in order to obtain an abundant alms, under the pretext                     that he had lost his wallet. As a matter of fact, he obtained a good sum of money                     from the Father by promising to curse no more. The wicked man himself told me                     the  story  (it  is  Father  Ruggeri  speaking).  But  God's  hand  caught  him:  shortly                     after the story, he was transferred to Taranto, where the railroad wagon buffers                     crushed him to death.                                                                     209                        10. Spirit of atonement                              The Father's live spirit of atonement was the outcome of his love for God and                     his hatred of sin.                          In 1875, the Italian Catholic press rose up against the profanation of the name                     of God at Dolo (Venice), where people gave the name of God to a race winning                     horse. The ecclesiastical authority of Messina ordered a triduo of atonement in                     the churches, and the Father wrote the song of reparation to the most holy Heart                     of Jesus, which begins thus:","Adorable Heart                               Of peace and forgiveness' zone,                               You are of the Triune                               The highest throne...                           When he founded his institute, he made its members join the Pious Union of                     Prayer and Penance aiming at atoning sins. He was careful that his communities                     fervently made the religious practices of reparation on the first Friday and first                     Saturday of month. Furthermore, he ordered to say the litany to the Sacred Face                     in April and a triduo at the end of Carnival in reparation of blasphemies. On that                     time  our  communities  sang  the  touching  stanzas  that  the  Father  wrote  on  the                     inner sorrows of the most holy Heart of Jesus. We quote the first stanza:                                O worries and sorrows of the Supreme Good,                               Of unknown pains abyss misunderstood,                               Profound torture and dull ache                               Send your divine Heart at stake.                               Oh! smile and joy never raise                               On your loving, Holy Face!                               But only darkness and tears                               My Jesus' sadness fears!                                                        210                           We also recall the  yearly novena  to the  most holy Name of Jesus with the                     exposition of the Blessed Sacrament on the altar, when through nine prayers the                     people  atoned  nine  classes  of  sins:  blasphemies,  heretical  curses,  scandals,                     persecutions to the holy Church, insults to the papacy and priesthood, bad press,                     sins of the consecrated persons, ruin of the youth, and profanation of the most                     holy Eucharist. The Father preached on these themes for 34 years.                          All the above prayers of reparation were customary, but for particular cases                     the Father ordered specific prayers for atonement.                          Now  and  then  the  Servant  of  God  mailed  circulars  to  his  communities                     ordering  reparation  for  sacrileges,  especially  against  the  Blessed  Sacrament.  It                     goes without saying that he himself was always actively involved.                          On  these  occasions  he  himself  did  special  penances,  and  ordered  the                     communities  to  make  holy  hours  of  adoration,  penances,  and  vigils,  exhorting                     each one to console Jesus by following his/her own fervor.","Owing to the Father's word and example which shook the persons by kindling                     their  fervor,  his  presence  made  the  prayers  of  reparation  more  solemn  and                     heartfelt in the communities.                          While exhorting the people to atone for blasphemies and sacrileges, the Father                     seemed  to  suffer  even  physically:  he  cried.  More  than  once,  after  hearing                     blasphemies in the streets, he gathered us in the chapel to pray for reparation and                     for the blasphemer's conversion.                          Besides  the  reparation  prayers  during  the  Carnival,  the  Father  wished  the                     sisters to entertain as many outside girls as they could, also inviting their parents.                     They did so with games and little plays all day long in order to prevent occasions                     of sin.                          Father Vitale writes:                           \"When he heard of profanity in churches, Canon Di Francia hastened to the                     rectors  to  propose  public  atonement.  Furthermore,  he  had  become  an  official                     guest speaker of many churches because the pastors had found in him a speaker,                     a poet, and a mystic along with one capable of enthusiastic prayer and songs\"                     (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 277).                           We also recall how much he strove to set up a crowded, fervent congregation                     of faithful at Camaro Superiore to atone for a sacrilegious theft.                        211                          At Mili San Pietro, sacrilegious robbers took away the sacred vessels along                     with the consecrated hosts, which were found dispersed in a field. The Father                     hastened to preach a triduo of atonement, had an icon erected on the spot where                     they  found  the  sacred  hosts,  and  convinced  the  pastor  to  promote  a  yearly                     Eucharistic procession on the anniversary of the event, to which he participated                     with his preaching. The Father took advantage of the reparations to awake the                     religious communities' fervor:                          \"First  of  all  we  have  to  honor  our  Lord  in  the  Blessed  Sacrament  and  our                     Lady  through  a  perfect  religious  observance,  because  our  Lord  is  displeased                     more by the sins of the consecrated souls than by the worldly-minded persons\"                     (Vol. 34, page l2).                          \"Let us be faithful to our Lord Jesus Christ by loving, serving him, and doing                     the religious practices. Our prayers and works must foster the good of souls and                     the relief of the poor\" (Vol. 35, page 217).                           The  time  after  the  first  European  war  was  marked  by  grave  disorders.  The                     specific offenses against God such as blasphemies, profanations, and sacrileges                     were not pointed out by the press in Italy, nor in the world. For this reason the                     Father wrote an ardent","petition  to  the  very  merciful  Heart  of  Jesus  for  the  salvation  of  the  most                     afflicted and ruined society (Vol. 5, page 55), and an offering of the holy mass                     and  Communion  in  reparation  of  the  sacrileges  committed  in  the  world,                     especially in our regions.                          This is a passage from the offering:                           O most afflicted and tortured Heart of Jesus our Lord, we want to share with                     you the very sharp pains you suffered at the sight of the horrible sacrileges which                     hell organized and sinners carried out against this Blessed Sacrament! O most                     afflicted Heart of Jesus, we are sorry for you, and through live faith and deep                     feelings  of  piety  we  want  to  share  your  inner  bitterness  for  so  many  terrible                     human ingratitudes! Ah! Most holy Heart of Jesus, if we could atone for such a                     shame  through  the  shedding  of  our  blood,  we  would  be  willing  to  do  so                     considering ourselves very fortunate to be victims of your love!                           To atone, he offers the infinite merits and sufferings of Jesus and the Virgin                     Mary, the merits and love of the angels and the saints, begging Jesus to forgive                     and convert sinners. Then he adds: \"Forgive our ingratitudes and  our offenses                     against  this  most  Blessed  Sacrament.\"  And  concludes:  \"Beloved  Jesus,  accept                     these offerings, plunge human iniquity into your very precious blood, and save                     us. Amen\" (Vol. 5, page 49).                                                              212                          The communities said this prayer for a long time. Afterwards, we will touch                     upon another extraordinary reparation in honor of our Lord.                        11. God’s will                             Love for God consists in performing everything for the sake of God's will.                     This is Jesus Christ's teaching and practice: \"None of those who cry out, “Lord,                     Lord,” will enter the kingdom of God but only the one who does the will of my                     Father in heaven\" (Mt. 7, 2l), and \"I always do what pleases him\" (Jn. 8, 29).                     Doing the will of God is the only","worry  of  the  saints.  The  following  saying  of  Saint  Joan  of  Arc  impressed  my                     mind: \"I know nothing but the will of God\"; thus, the illiterate peasant-woman of                     Domremy imposed the plans of battle to the marshals of France, and led the army                     to victory through and with God's will.                          That's how our Servant of God did God's will.                          When  he  was  a  guest  of  Msgr.  Loiacono  at  Ariano  Irpino,  they  walked                     through the episcopal square and stopped before the monument of Canon Peter                     Paul Parzanese.(4) There, Canon Di Francia recited with sweet sadness the first                     verses of Born blind, a beautiful poem by Parzanese:                                Please don't tell me that the mornings                               At the edges of the sky                               Return to awaken the things,                               In a blaze of golden dye.                               My eye didn't open under the sun,                               Oh, God's will be done!                           We relate another episode worthy remembering that I gleaned from the artisan                     Pietro Gulli' who witnessed it.                           One  day,  a  flower-seller  by  the  name  of  Laurence  was  entering  the  city,   213                     carrying a basket of snow-white fragrant gardenias from Cumia.  Suddenly  the                     basket slipped out of his hand, and the snow-white flowers fell down in a puddle.                          \"God's will be done,\" says the resigned poor man looking at the flowers, and                     thinking he had lost his daily bread.                          \"Yes, my son, bravo; God's adorable will be always done!,\" says the Father                     who  was  walking  behind  the  poor  man,  and  had  witnessed  the  scene.  \"That's                     nothing, be still, and hold the basket.\" The Servant of God stooped down, picked                     up the flowers one by one from the puddle, and put them in the basket as they                     were before snow-white fragrant.                          \"Miracle!\"  Exclaimed  the  amazed  poor  man;  but  the  Father  quickened  his                     pace and went away.                           \"God's will be done!\" This was the Father's program of life.                          His  usual  expressions  were:  \"Let  us  surrender  to  divine  will  God's  will  be                     done. Let us do in everything what pleases the Lord. Let us conform to divine                     will.\"                          He used to say, \"Ask the Lord for whatever you want, but always add: “If it                     pleases you, Lord”.\"                          Father Drago reports that when they were handling the","purchase  of  the  house  in  Rome,  the  middleman  and  our  lawyer  muddled  the                     issue;  at  the  Father's  usual  expression:  \"God's  will  be  done,\"  Father  Drago                     shouted:  \"That's  not  the  business  of  God's  will!    The  matter!  is  muddle  and                     theft!\" But the Father warned him: \"Keep silent, my blessed son: even in such                     cases there is God's permissive will, as it happened in the betrayal of Judas!\"                          The Morning Star Sisters had suffered damages. The Father wrote to them:                     \"Let us bend to God's will, who afflicts us in one way or another by permitting                     thefts, or mistakes, or the machinations of the ancient murderer, the devil! But                     everything helps those who love and fear God, as Saint Paul says\" (Vol. 39, page                     12). On another occasion, when he was waiting for the results of some dealings                     for  a  community's  good,  he  wrote:  \"To  get  the  papers,  it  takes  time...  But  we                     have to pray. Let us make novenas so that our Lord and the most holy Virgin get                     everything well done in the divine will\" (Vol. 39, page 28).                          He taught: \"When we say 'God's will be done,' we ought to say so by spirit of                     petitioning more than by submission\" (Vol. 6, page l07).                          The Servant of God writes to the novices: \"Doing God's will is truly the best                     and the greatest thing we can do\" (Vol. 34, page 2). For this reason he always                     strove to know and to do God's will.                          Writing  to  a  sisters'  community:  \"The  Lord's  ways  are  unfathomable,  but                     beautiful and lovable; who can understand them? Let us bend to them without                     understanding, based on the knowledge of how much Jesus loves us! Let us pray,            214                     work,  and  wait.  It  is  written:  “Bear  the  Lord's  delay,  work  strongly,  and  your                     heart will be relieved... The patient will suffer, but he will be also comforted...                     Whoever trusts in the Lord is strong and steadfast like mount Zion”\" (Vol. 39,                     page  l4).  When  he  ordered  to  say  some  prayers  for  the  house  of  Padua,  he                     specified: \"Above all we should ask and hope to perfectly fulfill the divine will\"                     (Vol. 34, page 95).                          The Father always endeavored to know and to do the divine will, and taught                     us to ask the Lord to know and carry it out faithfully, avoiding any sin. In his                     various sufferings, the Father was always resigned to God's adorable will, and no                     one heard him complaining for any wrong done to him. He used to say: \"The                     Lord knows what he is doing,\" and warned his sons and","daughters to never complain.                          During his various apostolic ministry, the Father had many sorrows, but few                     joys, receiving both of them from God. He used to say that to do the will of God,                     one should leave out even mass, Communion, etc. and in his last days he suffered                     much for being unable to say mass and to receive holy Communion, but he was                     resigned because of his union with God.                          Writing to a community about his condition, he said: \"Feebleness prevents me                     from  saying  mass  and  receiving  holy  Communion.  Pray  that  I  may  do  the                     lovable, adorable, divine will, which is better than anything else\" (Vol. 39, page                     75). A few days later: \"I do not know where it is going to end. Above all I wish                     divine will be perfectly done in me, praising and blessing Jesus in my suffering\"                     (Ibid. page 77).                          In 1924 he fell seriously sick in Rome, and wrote to Father Vitale:                           I am missing the adorable Jesus in the Communion, but his cross is dear and                     delightful to me, because I am doing his beloved divine will, which contains the                     life and the Passion of our Lord, and all the sacraments as well. I plunge myself                     in it to find and atone his divine Majesty for the honor I have not given to him, as                     well as to give him anything I should have before. In the divine will I find the                     spiritual and temporal goods of which I deprived my neighbor, the consolation                     for  the  hearts  I  have  afflicted,  and  the  goods  I  have  wasted.  The  divine  will   215                     contains everything in itself and is always atoning to God and the creatures (Vol.                     33, page 98).                           The Father recognized the will of God in all events, the least ones included,                     perfectly conforming to it. Father Vitale reports a little episode which happened                     on a July first dinner:                           Once, in the Avignone courtyard, we were sitting in the shadow of a plant                     tossed  by  wind.  When  a  thorny  branch  hurt  his  head,  he  quickly  exclaimed:                     “What  is  this  plant  doing  here?  It  is  better  to  move  it.”  Then,  as  if  aware  of                     having made a mistake that could have ill effects, he turned around, saying: \"I                     have been a fool asking what this plant is doing here! It is doing God's will to                     make  us  practice  patience.  We  have  to  bless  it\"  (Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di                     Francia, page 278).                           The Father never started any enterprise without premising a prayer to know                     and to do God's will, nor did he make the communities pray for graces without                     asking the Lord to make his will known. He established that the communities say                     every day a","prayer  to  know  and  to  do  the  will  of  God,  and  in  special  circumstances  he                     ordered triduos or novenas.                          In matter of importance, he joined prayer with the advice of the superiors and                     holy men.                          Once the decision was made according to the will of God, the Father carried it                     out calmly and firmly; but he was always ready to leave out an enterprise, when                     it showed to be against God's will.                        12. In bad and good times                              The  Father's  perfect  calm  in  good  and  bad  fortune  shows  his  perfect                     conforming  to the Lord's will; he carried out his enterprises to the best of his                     ability, but whatever the results might be he always kept serene.                          I  remember  the  Father's  attitude  in  relation  to  the  Avignone  civil  suit.  The                     owners' heirs sued him  because they considered his purchase illegitimate. The                     matter  was  serious,  and  the  institute  was  running  the  risk  of  great  financial                     damage. The Father did his best, busily working with the lawyers in preparing             216                     his defense. He also designated a celestial court made of angels and saints, to                     whom his and other communities prayed in shift. Then he entrusted himself to                     God's will. He won in the court and in appeal, but lost in the supreme court. As                     soon as I knew it, I informed the Servant of God: \"Father, we lost the case!\" He                     made no gesture of surprise, nor of amazement. He only said: \"God always wins,                     always wins!\" But he said these words so calmly and indifferently to my great                     wonder. To tell the truth, I was expecting an act of submission, but not such a                     calm. Thus, after doing his best, the Father showed his intimate union with God,                     who knows what he does. As though nothing had happened, he began talking of                     Our Lady of the Letter in whose honor he had to make a speech in the cathedral.                     Later, he definitively won the case in the new court of appeal in Palermo.","We  will  touch  upon  the  controversy  between  the  Father  and  the  bishop  of                     Potenza,  Msgr.  Razzoli,  who  interdicted  the  Father  from  entering  his  diocese                     because of the congregation of the Sisters of the Sacred Side. The Servant of God                     often said: \"Let's leave it in the hands of God. We will see how he will arrange                     the things.\" Not only  he did not complain for the notorious interdict, but also                     kept other persons quiet: \"No, no! The Lord disposed so, we have to conform to                     his  will.\"    When  Msgr.  Farina  was  appointed  Apostolic  Visitor,  the  mother                     superior  general  urged  the  visitor  to  solve  the  case,  but  the  Father  did  not                     approve her intervention:                           In relation to Msgr. Farina, I beg you to abstain from writing to him, and from                     doing anything, which could speed up the solution of our case. Let's leave it in                     the hands of God, who knows how much, and when he wants it. Meanwhile you                     pray that the results be for the greater glory of God and the salvation of souls                     (S.C. Vol. 8, page 24l). Do not worry how the old case will end. You see that all                     of you love Jesus, the sacrifice, the observance in everything, etc. Jesus will see                     to the rest (S.C. Vol. 8, page 254).                           Meanwhile he lays down the rules to be observed:                           Let us rely on the adorable Heart of Jesus, Our Lady of Sorrow, and our dear         217                     powerful  Saint  Joseph.  It  is  well  that  you  are  praying  and  are  making  other                     persons pray! Prayer, trust, prudence, patience, pure intention, spirit of humility,                     and peaceful minds are the weapons to achieve what pleases the Lord! Do not                     feed  selfishness  with  victories  over  those  who  oppose  you,  etc...  But  let  us                     acknowledge  that  everything  happens  because  of  our  sins;  therefore,  let  us  be                     merciful to all, excuse their intentions when we cannot excuse their actions, and                     pray that Jesus unite all the hearts in his heart and the heart of his most holy                     mother in the way he likes. Do not talk too much of the notorious case, but for                     necessity or usefulness, or to arouse religious fervor in prayer, hope, and silence.                     It is written: \"Silence and hope are  your strength.\" \"It is well for you to keep                     silent, waiting for the salvation of the Lord\" (S.C. Vol. 8, page 232).                           We  have  the  opportunity  to  see  how  generously  the  Father  accepted  God's                     will in everything, but here we confine ourselves to a few episodes.                          In 1911, the civil authority tried to requisition Saint Paschal convent in order                     to use it as a lazzaretto in case of cholera. We had already begun the transfer to                     the  Celestine  house,  toiling  to  settle  furniture  and  things  in  the  area  of  Saint                     Paschal convent","reserved  for  us.  Meantime  the  Father  wrote  to  Father  Palma,  who  had  to                     communicate the news to the communities of Messina:                           When you inform them, make them understand that everything has been done                     calmly, and that everything comes from the loving will of God, who builds the                     story of the institute at any rate through his love, testing its faithfulness and faith.                     By faith we have to see the hand of God working in the misfortunes, which may                     contain spiritual and temporal goods, or are the prelude of divine mercies. I am                     glad that all this happened when you were not dwelling here, because you would                     have suffered, especially when you had to report the news. Now let us bless and                     praise the loving will of our Jesus and his most holy mother! Without worrying                     about our future, we must be calm and trustful in the most holy Hearts of Jesus                     and Mary, and in the protection of our dear guardian angels (S.C. Vol. 7, page                     60).                           When  he  happened  to  have  a  foot  seriously  contused,  he  wrote  to  Father                     Vitale: \"The Lord's will be done. He visits us lovingly!\" (Vol. 3l, page 60). On                     another occasion: \"Among the divine graces and mercies we notice holy crosses,                     afflictions, contradictions, sickness, oppositions, and for all of them we mean to                     thank  the  divine  kindness.  We'll  do  the  same  for  the  patience  and  submission                     granted to us by the Lord in order to bear them, as well as for his kindness in           218                     turning everything to our greater good\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page 249).                          Talking  about  the  Spanish  epidemic  which  was  ravaging  all  Europe  in                     September-October of 1918, the Father pours out his heart to Father Vitale:                           The  holy  hand  of  God  makes  itself  felt  everywhere  to  the  insane,  apostate                     society!  What  a  joy  it  brings  to  me,  should  we  even  die!  It  is  time  to  punish                     human iniquities! May God be atoned for the human transgression. May kings                     and oppressed peoples be regenerated under the divine scourge: thus, they will be                     saved.  \"Only  honor  and  glory  is  yours,  almighty  Father!\"  But  this  is  only  the                     beginning of the sorrows! Let us surrender confidently to the adorable Heart of                     Jesus, offering ourselves as victims of his adorable will! (Vol. 32, page l57).                           A few days later, after manifesting the conditions of the house in Trani, where                     none of the priests was going to give Communion to those daughters for fear of                     contracting the disease, he takes again the subject of the disease:","How perfect God is even when he punishes! This is a disease that no one can                     defeat, neither government, nor city halls, nor Red Cross; furthermore, there are                     no eggs, no milk, no medicine, no doctors, no means! We can only surrender to                     his divine Heart! … But the press keeps silent indifferently, while the theaters are                     on! Now Italian fashion is getting ready to vie with the Parisian one!...Even the                     Italian toys! And the war develops with divine mystery... May God save Italy,                     France, and the world! (Vol. 32, page l59).                           Around the same time he writes to Altamura: \"Long live Jesus and the holy                     cross! God's will be done: let us conform to it with joy!\" (Vol. 36, page l02).                          After arranging the plan for the personnel of a house, the appointed mother                     superior falls sick. The Father remarks: \"The Lord continues visiting us in his                     infinite  mercy!  Don't  we  have  to  bless  him?  Let  us  bend  and  adore  God's                     unfathomable judgments!\" (Vol. 35, page 98).                          In 1921, the Father had an occasion to buy land along with its facilities in                     Rome,  but  he  did  not  see  clearly  into  it:  \"It  is  an  affair  we  have  to  pray  for                     enlightenment in order to follow the Lord's will\" (Vol. 36, page 26). In 1924, at                     the time of the escrow, the Father writes to Mother Nazzarena: \"Only God knows                     if we are going to take possession of it: but we conform to his will\" (Vol. 36,                     page 102).                          Informing  the  community  of  the  contract  date,  he  writes:  \"Will  we  find    219                     obstacles? God knows it! We pray that God's will be done perfectly\" (Vol. 36,                     page 109). Talking about the sisters' sickness, he remarks: \"The blessed Jesus is                     visiting us in various ways, and we are doing his adorable will\" (Vol. 36, page                     165).                        13. Prayers to do god's will                              We like reporting a few prayers that the Father wrote in order to know and to                     do the will of God.                          In the manuscripts dating back to his youth, Nov. l4, l873, we find the prayer                     \"to do God's will.\" He copied it from the Imitation of Christ, book 3, chapter l5,","no. 2, 3, 4. Later, the Father inserted the first part of it into the daily prayers of                     the community, adding: \"Loving Mother of my Lord, let me do the will of my                     Lord.\"                          Despite he had not received a grace, the Father praises the Lord and offers                     himself to God's adorable will in a prayer of Oct. 2, 1888 (S.C. Vol. 10, page 6).                     He wrote in a note: \"I want my slavery to the divine will to be my chief aim\"                     (S.C. Vol. 10, page 36).                          His niece Mrs. Rosalia Bonetti remembers: \"Once he wrote a prayer for my                     mother, in which he asked the Lord that all life be always conformed to his holy                     will. This prayer was handed down to me, and I said it until I lost the manuscript,                     not knowing the prayer by heart.\"                          In the prayer for the New Year's Day's vigil, the community protests \"to want                     nothing in the new year but God's will.\" The Father specifies: \"If you have graces                     and  mercies  in  store  for  us,  as  you  do  with  your  creatures  in  your  infinite                     kindness, we thank you beforehand. If you have tribulations and sorrows, as you                     do with those whom  you love and want saved, since now we mean to receive                     them from your hand, now we praise, thank, and bless you\" (S.C. Vol. 9, page 5).                          It was perhaps when Jensen seceded from him that the Father wrote a specific                     offering of mass to the most holy heart of Jesus so that the divine will prevailed                     over in that circumstance:                                                                                                               220                          Today I offer the great sacrifice of the mass to implore a perfect fulfillment of                     your divine will in this affair... Do not look at my demerits, but at your merits                     worth  infinite  value  and  at  those  of  your  most  holy  mother  and  of  the  saints.                     Please grant me this grace. Give me holy virtue and strength so that I may be                     quiet, serene, and peaceful, conforming to your will. Apart from my inclination                     or ideas, may I wish you and your greater glory, considering and adoring  the                     sovereign rule and the holy, perfect dispositions of your divine will in any human                     event, even the most least (sic)  (Vol. 6, page l).                           In his last years, he wrote the \"Little Rosary of Divine Will,\" and he used to                     say it every day more than once, especially in his last sickness. It begins with                     Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory, and continues by the saying at every bead:                     \"Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.\" “A Glory be” is inserted at                     every decade of beads, and at the end of the little rosary is said:","\"My Lord Jesus Christ, I love, praise, adore, thank, and bless you together                     with the Father and the Holy Spirit. Amen.\"                          In his last sickness, the Father wrote to a person who was praying for him:                           I thank you for your prayer. Obtain for me patience and strength against the                     enemy who perturbs me by trying to infuse a loomy mood in me. I would like to                     be cheerful. We should be ashamed of not being so when we consider that we                     have surrendered to the divine will and to the love of sweet Jesus (S.C. Vol. 5,                     page 139).  I went through terrible times. Heavens seemed closed... But, the more                     my physical, moral, and spiritual sorrows increase, the more I feel attached to the                     divine will: Fiat! Fiat! As you want, Lord, and at any cost, but help me!                          Please obtain for me a perfect uniformity and conformity with his divine will,                     asking the Lord to make me die in his divine will with a purified conscience and                     being purgatory-free, if Jesus wants so (Ibid. page l43).                           We quote a few witnesses: \"I remember very well his evident submission in                     his  last  sickness  at  the  Holy  Spirit,  before  being  moved  to  Guardia:  his                     expressive look at the sky was very persuasive.\" \"In his last sickness, both his                     surrender to God and his perfect uniformity with divine will shone; he bore his                     pains  not  only  with  patience,  but  also  with  joy,  saying:  “My  Easter  is  God's                     will... and the like.”- \"I took care of the Father for l5 days in his last sickness. He   221                     was conformed to God's will, often saying: 'What are these pains compared with                     those of our Lord'?\"                          The Father's life-long care of seeking and doing the divine will ended in his                     perfect conforming and living in God's will. We find the evidence of it in his own                     notes:                           My spirit's room is the divine will. Any time I am unsatisfied or disappointed,                     even when things seem directed to the greater glory of God, my spirit will retire                     to this room. For this reason I will not make any distinction between permissive                     and the ruling will of God, because both of them are for me the divine, adorable,                     loving, desirable God's will, which is the center and the shelter of my spirit.                          I hate everything which is against the divine will, such as sin. So that my love                     for  the  divine  will  be  perfect,  I  will  hate  grave  and  light  faults,  rejecting                     everything which is not fully conformed to the divine will. Consequently, I will                     hate my imperfections, striving to amend and become holy.                          I will retreat to this room in any set-back and tribulation coming from God, or                     from creatures, or from my enemies, or even from myself","because of malice and weakness, etc. I will do the same in my sorrows, which are                     the outcome of my imperfections.                          I will stay in this room, praying that the aim of the divine will be achieved on                     earth  as  it  is  in  heaven.  I  will  also  pray  for  the  interests  of  the  Sacred  Heart,                     especially for his sending out good workers to the holy Church.                          To  correspond  to  divine  will,  I  will  give  priority  to  the  wishes  of  love,                     sanctification, and salvation of souls. My wishes of love will be endless, likewise                     those of sanctification and salvation of souls. Thus, the divine will is pleased.                          Finally, I will endeavor to make the divine will known and loved by all so that                     all the people may shelter in its room, where my spirit is for ever and ever. Amen                     (Vol. 43, page l45).                        Notes                             (1) We have three little prayers to Saint John of the cross. the Father asks the saint to                     obtain for him the same grace he received from the Lord (Vol. 6, page l25).                                                                                                               222                          (2) We report it.                          O very humble and meek heart of Jesus, who set yourself as our model, I entreat you                     to give me an effective grace so that today I do not offend, nor displease you. I hand my                     heart  to  you,  asking  you  to  keep  it  away  from  uncharitable  affections  and  from  any                     attachment. Because you said, \"Do not be afraid,\" keep back the movements of my heart                     at their rising, which give way to anger or indignation, setting bad example to those I                     should edify. Cover this cold, restless heart with holy meekness and calm so that my                     spirit be detached and calm in any circumstance and contrast. My Jesus, see to it that                     today's movements of my hearts be movements of zeal and charity. I beg you to keep                     me free from indiscreet  zeal,  which  goes  out  of the bounds  of prudence and justice,                     being a destroying passion instead of an edifying virtue. My strong Jesus, free me today                     from the timidity which hinders me, and infuse holy and generous courage in me. Today                     I will go in the midst of your poor. My Jesus, see to it that I be kind with them; make                     me meek in dealing, apt to teaching, right in judging, prudent in correcting,  fervent in                     the work. As a priest, make me the light of the world and the salt of the earth. May I                     today edify the souls entrusted to me, and win them to your divine heart through virtue                     and doctrine.","My  Jesus,  today  I  entrust  my  tongue  to  you  in  a  special  way:  keep  and  purify  it,                     teaching me how to be silent and how to speak, O Word of God.                          Take care of my mouth, O Lord! Keep me from saying offensive, useless, idle words                     contrary to charity, prudence, and simplicity, but give me ardent words of eternal life,                     and a chaste, wise speech for the people I am going to meet. For the sake of your mercy,                     O my Jesus, I beg you to free me today from the tricks and tempations of my hellish                     enemies, from any offense to you, and from the deceit and frauds of creatures.                          Kneeling at  your feet, my Jesus, I retreat into the loving wound of your left foot:                     keep me inside it as in an invincible fort. Teach me to suffer for your sake, to desire and                     seek  your  love,  all  day  long.  My  Jesus,  I  do  not  know  the  tribulations  that  your                     provident and loving hand has in store for me today, but whatever they may be, I beg                     you to grant me the effective grace to embrace them as the means to achieve your love.                          Finally, O my Jesus, since you are the owner of the hearts, I beg you to soothe the                     hearts of those who are about to treat with me for your glory, their sanctification, and                     mine. Grant me your Holy Spirit that he may work in me, move me according to your                     will, and govern my behavior and the behavior of those entrusted to me. O very meek                     heart of my Jesus, today grant me a particular vigilance over myself, and a special care                     of the holy virtues in order to catch the precious moment and the happy occasion of                     your gentle inspirations. Make me faithful in the little things, mortified in the senses,                     detached  from  food  and  comfort,  that  I  may  perform  everything  in  your  presence,                     always keeping it in my mind and spirit. May I today lift up my heart and thoughts to                     you, praising, desiring, sighing, blessing, invoking, seeking you with internal acts, inner                     sighs,  and  fervent  ejaculatory  prayers.  Recollected  in  you,  my  center,  my  life,  my                     treasure,  my  supreme  good,  my  all,  and  showing  even  outwardly  my  internal      223                     recollection through the features of the face, gestures, meekness, and gentleness, may I                     edify the people. My Jesus, see to it that I spend in a holy manner this day, which your                     infinite mercy grants me, and which could be the last of my life! Even though you are                     eternal, you used the time in a divine manner.  For the sake of your divine use of the                     time  and  of  your  spirit  of  prayer,  through  which  you  prayed  most  fervently  for  all                     creatures and for me to the Father, to whom you are substantially united, grant me this                     grace. May one of your divine prayers obtain for me the effective grace to behave as a                     minister should in the midst of the poor and children. My Jesus, hear me for the sake of                     your  most  holy  Mother;  hear  me  for  the  sake  of  the  saints.  Hear  me.  Amen.  Amen.                     Amen (Vol. 6, pages 138-40).                           (3)  The  witness  thinks  so,  because  Melanie  always  reminded  the  punishments                     foretold to her by the most holy Virgin in her apparition at La Salette; but the theme of                     divine punishments was very frequent in the Father's preaching, and his writings shows                     that it dates before his connection with Melanie.                           (4) He was born at Ariano Irpino, and died in Naples (1809-1852). He was a canon,                     the  capitular vicar of the diocese, an orator and a poet. He distinguished himself for his                     fearless assistance to the cholera patient in 1837, and was card-catalogued credible by                     the Borbonica police because of his patriotic poetry. By nature and training, he was very                     similar to Bisazza, the Father's teacher, who wrote to him on Sept. 6, 1847: \"There is                     harmony  in  our  souls,  brains,  and  hearts.\"  \"Author  of  patriotic  songs,  such  as  Il                     Coscritto, he found inspiration in the country and home affection with humility of heart                     and exquisiteness of conscience. His Songs of the poor, aiming at education, spring","from spontaneous and poetic sensitiveness\" (Bargellini, Pian dei Giullari, vol. 3, page                     102). Until a few decades ago, the school-anthologies reported some of his poems, such                     as La Croce, La cieca nata, Il vecchio sergente, etc. These became very popular.

Be enamored of Jesus Christ                         Jesus is the most alive and concrete manifestation of God's love for humankind                     (Jn. 3, 16); the best way to reciprocate this love is to be enamored of Jesus. May                     God give us such a gift.                             How  much  the  Father  loved  Jesus!  Says  Father  Vitale:  “I  have  never                     forgotten one evening, when I said good-by to him, he told me, then a cleric: “Be                     enamored of Jesus Christ.” I still feel these words, because they have wounded                     my  soul  gently;  I  cannot  express  what  they  did  to  my  heart”  (Father  Mary                     Hannibal Di Francis,  page 283). Be enamored of Jesus Christ! Simple words,                     but having a particular vibration coming out of a heart enamored of Jesus Christ.                     Comments Father Vitale, “I still feel these words, because they have wounded                     my soul gently; I cannot express what they did to my heart” (Ibid. page 283).                             To be enamored of Jesus Christ is the saints' passion. Says Saint Teresa:                     “A person should imagine himself in the presence of Jesus Christ, talking with                     him and becoming enamored of his humanity” (Life, ch. 12, no. 2). It is exactly                     what the Father did. To the atheist Cannizzaro the Father merely  said:  “Dear                     professor, I acknowledge that Jesus Christ, true God and true man, is my love,            226                     my supreme good! He is the sigh of my life, the hope of my eternal happiness!”                     (S.C. Vol. 5, page 120). Imbued with admiration for our Lord, the Father could                     say together with the apostle: « For, to me, “life” means Christ » (Phil. 1, 21).                             Writes  Father  Vitale:  “Because  of  his  reverence  to  Jesus,  his  words                     pierced hearts as if they were arrows” (Ibid. page 283). The Father exhorted us:                             The practice of divine love of the congregants will be always directed to                     the adorable Jesus Christ! Oh! May divine mercy let us be enamored of the lover                     of hearts, of the king of eternal love, of the eternal love of our souls! Let us love                     Jesus Christ with a great transport of heart,","mind,  and  soul!  Let  us  be  eager  to  increase  his  holy  love,  asking  for  it  many                     times a day the adorable Heart of Jesus, his most holy mother, who is the mother                     of the beautiful love, our patron saints, and the angels (S.C. Vol. 10, page 183).                         He wrote in the Points of Rules:  “Love of Jesus must be the beginning, the                     object, the end, and the mover of our intentions, actions, and observance: Jesus,                     everything in Jesus, through Jesus, for Jesus, and from Jesus” (Vol. 3, page 166).                              And in the Declarations and Promises:                          The  only  aim  in  my  actions  and  life  will  be  Jesus:  loving  Jesus  as  much  as  he                     deserves, sighing for him, pleasing him in everything, and belonging to Jesus with the                     most  fervent  love,  and  perfect  union  of  his  and  my  will.  Through  lively  faith  I  will                     contemplate Jesus in the innermost depth of my heart where he dwells, urges me to love                     him, asks for love, attracts me, longs for being one with me, and grieves so much every                     time I do not make up for my faults.                          I will listen to him talking in my spirit, asking for souls and for sacrifice out of love                     for him and for souls (Vol. 44, page 113).                          For him, the visible sign of holiness was love for Jesus. For this reason he                     sought to know and to meet the people who were full with this love. He used to                     say:    “Privileged  souls  can  work  miracles,  but  if  they  are  not  great  lovers  of   227                     Jesus,  I  do  not  feel  drawn  to  them”  (Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di  Francia,  page                     281).  He  greeted  Jesus  “The  Divine  Archer  of  Hearts,”  and  referring  to  this                     poetic  imagination  of  Jesus  shooting  arrows  of  love  to  win  souls,  the  Father                     wrote:                             When he wants to wound a heart                             With sweet love,                            Thinking of it is enough;                            He sets an agile arrow on the bow                            Aims and shoots quickly                            At the heart unexpected love:                            Oh, the wounds he opens in the heart,                            Making it long for love!                      Writes Father Vitale:                             At the beginning of every year, when we draw the pictures of saints and                     angels  by  lot  to  win  their  protection  and  to  practice  a  specified  virtue  and                     mortification,  more  than  once  cards  read:    “Love  of  Jesus.”    The  padre                     considered  it  as  a  privilege.  You  had  to  see  his  posture  when  such  a  card                     appeared. After reading it to himself, he began smiling; then he","would  take  off  his  glasses  and  exclaim,  raising  his  right  arm:  “Children,  how                     beautiul this one is! How lucky the owner is! He has rightly” (then he would                     pause to build  up suspense), and then he spoke sweetly,  “love of  Jesus.”   He                     clapped his hands and everyone followed him applauding; he wanted the hearts                     of  his  children  to  delight  in  hearing  Jesus'  name  (Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di                     Francia, page 281).                          Another episode, of which I am a witness.  “A few years before the padre's                     death, the institute was taking a snapshot of the orphans around him. Everything                     was ready, the children were looking into the camera when suddenly the padre                     exclaimed: “Look at the camera and say in your heart: Jesus, I love  you! The                     camera will pick up your utterance and will print it in your image.”  This little                     joke revealed the flame in his heart” (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page                     284).                        2. Above all, love for Jesus                         The Father continuously exhorted people by writings to love our Lord:  “Jesus             228                     dislikes  cold  hearts,  but  likes  intimate,  tender,  effusive,  strong,  calm,  constant                     love.                               Please  love  Jesus  with  great  transport  of  will  and  mind,  with  all  the                     interior  powers  and  the  feelings  of  your  soul;  be  always  fully  aware  of  his                     adorable  person  and  of  the  mysteries  of  his  most  holy  life.  May  the  holy                     tabernacle,  which  is  the  loving  nest  where  his  divine  body  gathers  the  eagles,                     attract you” (Vol. 45, page 397).                          He wrote to the Rogationists: “Dearest children, I exhort you to expand your                     heart  in  the  most  holy  love  of  the  adorable,  most  loving  Jesus  our  Lord.  Oh!                     What results may youths achieve, if they do not feel love for Jesus?” (S.C. Vol.                     S, page 55).                          He protested to seek nothing but love for Jesus: “Dearest Father,” he wrote to                     a priest, “if you know the secret to become holy and to love Jesus with pure love,                     please teach it to me;","this is the only thing I want to know!” (Vol. 37, page 44). He exhorts the first                     novices:  “Daughters  in  Jesus  Christ,  let  us  endeavor  to  sanctify  ourselves,                     because all else is vanity. The Holy Spirit said: “Where there is no science of the                     soul, there is no good.” Let us love Jesus, our supreme goodness, attend to him                     with one heart, one soul, one mind; let us look at Jesus, work for Jesus, zeal for                     the  interests  of  his  heart,  worry  for  what  worries  him,  and  rejoice  for  what                     pleases  him.  Let  us  have  no  thought  but  Jesus,  because  we  find  happiness  in                     Jesus only.” It is true that by following Jesus we cannot avoid the cross; for this                     reason  lie  continues  saying:  “It  is  true  that  we  face  opposition,  contradiction,                     struggles,  and  troubles,  but  all  these  things  are  means  of  sanctification.                     Daughters,  be  sure  of  this:  if  you  were  in  the  world,  you  would  be  suffering                     tribulation and labor much more serious and bitter than the ones you endure in                     the religious life, but without merit. Therefore, let us be pleased with suffering                     some pain together with Jesus, our supreme goodness, who suffered so much for                     our sake!” (Vol. 34, page 75). He writes in the rules:                          Religious  virtues  and  the  practice  of  divine  love  will  be  the  rules  for  the                     novices. To grow in the love of Jesus, supreme goodness, they will do and suffer                     everything for his sake. They will think of him, meditate on his life, his Passion,                     his death, and on the mysteries of his infinite love.                          Always  keeping  in  mind  the  adorable,  Divine  Savior  they  will  meditate       229                     especially on the pain of his Divine Heart. They must be loving souls. If they are,                     love  will  make  them  strong  in  their  suffering,  in  their  work,  and  in  their                     immolation, leading them to divine union, which is the aim of their suffering and                     work (1). They must always ask of the most holy Heart of Jesus for his love, the                     love of the most holy Virgin, and other holy loves. (Vol. 2, page 142).                          A daily prayer of the novices to Saint Theresa said: “The tender, strong love                     for Jesus, supreme goodness, be our personal character and the character of this                     little Retreat” (Vol. 2, page 6).                              The Father is also urgent with the Rogationists:                          Let us meditate on three mysteries of suffering of Jesus Christ: suffering in                     his  human  nature,  public  contempt,  and  inner  sorrows.  They  are  an  abyss  of                     infinite love, and happy is he who meditates upon them! Let us meditate on Jesus                     Christ's benefits, his divine beauty, any feature of his human life, and his divine                     Heart, which is a furnace of infinite love. Let us meditate upon the marvelous                     presence of Jesus in the most holy Eucharist, where he reveals three mysteries of                     infinite charity: his","continuous dwelling among us, his immolation on the altar, and the making of                     himself food and drink! If we do not meditate on Jesus, we are unable to love                     him, but, if we meditate upon him, we cannot help loving him! (S.C. Vol. 5, page                     55).                          For the Rogationist probationers:                           “The  probationer  who  does  not  work  everything  for  Jesus  will  never                     achieve interior spirit. Virtues will be for him a shallow practice; furthermore,                     step by step he will get used to a spirit of falsehood and hypocrisy, becoming                     unworthy to live in the Lord's house” (S. C. Vol. 10, page 164).                          Our  Lord's  life,  his  examples,  and  divine  virtues  formed  the  object  of  the                     Father's continuous meditation and the model of his life. It appears from “My                     Lord  Jesus  Christ's  Imitation,”  a  few  notes  in  which  the  Father  considers  the                     salient behavioral points of the divine Master in order to imitate him: “My Lord                     Jesus  prayed  incessantly  with  recollection  during  his  tremendous  suffering...                     sympathized, looked for, and loved sinners... loved, forgave, excused, and prayed                     for his enemies, returning good for evil, immolating himself, and rescuing many                     of them... said only holy and perfect words... spent no moment without suffering,         230                     praying, and working... concealed his infinite suffering under silence.”                          The numbers 37 virtues of our Lord, which he strove to imitate (S.C. Vol. 9,                     page 9). (1)                        3. Solemn protestations of love                         We have already talked of the Father's activity to atone for public profanations or                     offenses against our Lord; now we like reporting two of his acts of atonement.                          In  1875,  Ernst  Renan,  the  author  of  a  blasphemous  life  of  Jesus,  after                     attending a scientific congress in Palermo toured the","main Sicilian cities and stopped in Messina on September 16, 1875. His friends                     did their best to prepare a triumphal welcome for him, but they did not succeed.                     The Catholic press  mobilized the public  opinion against the novelist of Seine,                     who had adulterated history through a pseudo scientific apparatus, divesting our                     Lord of his divinity. Above all, the youth rose up generously showing their faith,                     and our padre, who was not yet a priest at that time, published a vibrant protest.                     We report the last part:                          “Citizens of Messina, let us renew the protestations of our faith and the fits of                     our love toward the divine redeemer Jesus Christ, God and true man, when Ernst                     Renan,  an  unfortunate  apostate,  will  be  here  to  profane  the  Catholic  Messing                     with his presence. He has offended our Lord Jesus Christ in his divinity and has                     mocked  his  sublime  agony,  also  manifesting  his  sentiments  of  affection  for                     Judas, the traitor! May each one of us protest highly, giving no homage, not even                     with the mere presence to the author of the most abominable, odious libel, which                     the revolution and the hellish sects, enemies of God's name, greet in triumph.                     While the fool and the deceived clap their hands and help this poor creature to go                     from city to city ashamed, let us gather in our churches to praise and bless the                     sweetest name of our Redeemer and to appease his wrath provoked by sins. May                     we be one in our sentiment, affection, and thought, crying out with love: “ Long                     live Jesus Christ, true God and true man!” (The Catholic Word, September 16,                     1875).                                                                                    231                          In 1916, Benito Mussolini was quite unknown; he poured forth sacrilegious                     blasphemies  against  our  Lord  in  his  newspaper  The  People  of  Italy  with  the                     article “No to Christ, yes to Barabbas!” The title was a hellish cry. The Christian                     world  shuddered  with  horror,  and  the  Father  was  pierced  in  his  heart.  From                     Padua,  he  wrote  to  the  communities  on  October  1,  ordering  a  triduo  of                     atonement:                          Dearest  children  in  Jesus  Christ,  I  do  not  know  if  you  have  heard  the                     sorrowful  news  of  the  gravest  offenses  against  the  adorable  our  Lord  Jesus                     Christ. Someone of the Masonic newspaper of Milan has cursed in such a way as                     none  ever  did.  He  has  addressed  to  our  Lord  the  most  injurious  words,  has                     announced  that  they  will  destroy  the  churches,  the  altars,  the  statues  of  the                     Madonna and the saints, and the like, repeating the cry of the Jews: “Away with                     this man; release Barabbas for us! Crucify him.”                          The Catholic world has become indignant at such blasphemous language, has                     censured  the  horrendous  blasphemies  through  the  press,  and  has  made  public                     reparations everywhere.","Then  the  Father  orders  a  triduo  of  atonement  through  these  religious                     practices:                          Morning: 1. A special offering of the holy mass  “to praise, bless, and thank                     Jesus  our  Lord,  adorable  loving  Redeemer,  in  atonement  for  the  horrendous,                     hellish  blasphemies  published  in  an  impious,  hellish  newspaper  of  Milan.”  2.                     Holy Communion and the prayer of the first Friday of the month.                          Afternoon:  Exposition  of  the  Blessed  Sacrament  at  least  two  hours  before                     dusk:  “The  practices  of  devotion  will  be  of  adoration,  praise,  blessing,  and                     thanksgiving  for  the  infinite  love  of  Jesus,  as  well  as  amends,  protests,  and                     manifestation  of  love.”  Then  he  invites  “the  individuals  who  love  Jesus,  our                     divine Redeemer, to make the best offers in atonement for such hellish offenses”                     (Vol. 34, page 106). To stigmatize the execrable blasphemy, the Father writes                     grave words on the October issue of God and Neighbor:                              Atonement for very Horrendous Blasphemies!                          Perhaps  most  of  our  readers  know  that  an  impious,  hellish  newspaper  of                     Milan has published very horrendous blasphemies against the adorable our Lord                     Jesus  Christ.  Drawn  by  unbridled  Satanical  fierceness,  persons  who  have  sold                     themselves  to  the  devil  have  published  the  most  offensive  words  against  the    232                     divine Redeemer, threatening with blowing him out of the world, laughing! They                     concluded  by  repeating  the  impious  saying:  “Away  with  this  man;  release                     Barabbas for us! Crucify him!”                           “Unfortunate persons engulfed into iniquity! We would dare saying that we                     don't  feel  drawn  to  pray  for  their  conversion,  because  through  their  refined,                     planned  style  they  show  to  be  already  in  the  number  of  the  reprobates!  They                     descended into hell still living! As it is written, they will be the footstool of our                     Lord Jesus Christ, when he comes again in glory at the end of time to judge the                     living and the dead.” After touching upon the reaction of good persons all over                     the world, he invites the faithful to offer private and public reparations to our                     Lord for the gravest insults done to him (S.C. Vol. 1, page 178).                          The Father did not confine himself to atonement for public offenses; he rather                     liked his children to atone continuously from within their hearts. He writes:                             If you can do a favor for Jesus, the best you can do is to say “I love","you!” He longs for and wants love from us. Let us say it, therefore, over and over                     again; when unable to speak, we will say it by heart! So that no moment of our                     life is without pronouncing such a saying, we declare that we intend to repeat                     “Jesus,  I  love  you!”  at  each  beat  of  our  heart.  Jesus  deserves  our  love;  why                     shouldn't we heartily reciprocate his infinite love by loving him with our little                     love? We say, therefore, over and over again with all our heart:  “Jesus, I love                     you. “ (2)                          Now, I feel obliged to report an episode which happened when I encountered                     the  Father  for  the  first  time,  on  August  20,  1911.  We  were  eight  children                     altogether, going with him to his institute in Oria.                          As  soon  as  the  train  moved,  he  asked  me:  “Tell  me,  how  much  you  love                     Jesus?”                          I stammered: “I love him as much as I can.” He insisted: “How much do you                     want to love him?” I do not remember whether, nor what I answered. I remember                     instead that after addressing the same question to each of us, he suggested this                     answer: “I want to love Jesus with the love of the angels and the saints in heaven,                     with the love of the most holy Virgin Mary, and, finally, with the same love of                     his divine Father.”                                                                                                               233                         He explained: \"Certainly, that is not possible; but, what does it matter? Jesus                     appreciates holy wishes, delights in them, and increases the flames of his love in                     the soul!”                        4. The most holy Name of Jesus                                Now let us consider some particular  manifestations of the Father's love                     toward  Jesus  and  his  mysteries,  beginning  with  the  worship  to  his  most  Holy                     Name. As the name of Jesus was like harmony to the ears, honey to the mouth,                     joy  to  the  heart  of  Saint  Bernard,  so  it  was  to  the  Father's.  The  favorite                     ejaculatory prayer the Father said in a very low voice was: Long live Jesus. \"It                     was the cry of the soul that longed for union with God”                      (Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di  Francia,  page  282).  \"Father  Alessi,  a  Carmelite,                     remembers the Father with delight before the earthquake as a pioneer making","children use the greeting: \" Praised be Jesus Christ! \" When the postulants took                     the religious garb, the padre used to give them new names: he chose those that                     included the name of Jesus, such as Gesuina, Gesuele, Gesualda, Gesulmina. The                     holy man could not help expressing his love of Jesus. (Father Mary Hannibal Di                     Francia, page 282). He wrote:                          “Pronouncing  the  word  “Jesus  \"  calls  to  mind  the  mysteries  of  his  love,                     wisdom, and charity. By only pronouncing the name of Jesus I will be aware of                     his  presence.  It  will  revive  my  motives  to  love  him  by  recalling  to  mind  the                     following: that he created, redeemed, and called me; that he has granted me so                     many favors; that I belong to him as a priest. While pronouncing or hearing the                     sweetest name of Jesus, I will also bow my head” (Vol. 44, page 113).                          The Father did not confine himself to the liturgical rule of bowing the head                     when Jesus' name is spoken during the religious service; he demanded to apply                     such a rule always and everywhere.  “How much I grieve when I see some of                     these children not bowing their heads when Jesus' name is spoken. I guess they                     haven't  learned  that  I  bow  deeply  on  purpose  to  show  them  a  good  example”                     (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 282).                          By faith, he made sick people swallow bits of paper with the name “Jesus”                     written on them; he wrote special prayers to Jesus for their healing, and signed          234                     his  own  forehead  with  the  name  (Vol.  5,  pages  52-54).  Following  Saint                     Bernardino of Siena, the Father had a tablet painted with the name “Jesus\" like a                     shining sun. It was displayed in our communities and in the faithful's houses; in                     the bottom of the painting was written these initials: M. J. A. B. (Mary, Joseph,                     Anthony, and Bernardino).                          This beautiful, beneficial devotion is among the main ones in our institutes                     (Vol. 1, page 80). The month of January is dedicated to the name of Jesus, and                     every  day  the  communities  read  a  special  passage  from  a  booklet  during  the                     evening  meditation.  Preceded  by  a  solemn  novena  with  the  exposition  of  the                     Blessed Sacrament, the feast is celebrated the last day of the month. The Father                     wrote the prayers of the novena, added three quatrains to the well known song                     (All'orecchio, al labro, al cuore...), and during the first European war added four                     verses to each stanza to match the atonement prayers.                          Until 1907 the novena was celebrated privately. In 1908 it was celebrated in                     the Holy Spirit's church, and the novena","booklet printed by our “Typography of the Sacred Heart” was distributed to the                     people.  Father  Pantaleone  Palma  notes  in  the  preface:  “On  the  feast,  five                     Eucharistic lamps have been offered in honor of the five letters forming the name                     Jesus.  The  faithful  were  exhorted  to  keep  the  lamp  burning;    thus,  the  flames                     honor the sacramental presence of Jesus, who will illumine, comfort, and make                     us happy.” At the end of the same year, the earthquake destroyed the lamps, but                     they were replaced by thirteen ones as a memorial of the thirteen Daughters of                     Divine Zeal who had perished under the ruins.                          The  feast  of  the  most  Holy  Name  in  the  old  liturgy  was  of  second  class                     (today we would say \" feast \"), and was celebrated on the second Sunday after                     Epiphany.  When  Saint  Pius  X  moved  it  to  the  first  days  of  January,  our                     communities were unable to celebrate it solemnly with the novena, because of                     the Christmas feasts; therefore, they transferred the celebration to the last day of                     January, and by pontifical prescriptions we are authorized to say two masses of                     the most Holy Name of Jesus on that day.                          The novena should be done with all fervor, and the Father often called the                     communities' attention: “I suppose you are doing the novena of the most adorable                     name  of  Jesus  with  great  fervor,  and  hope  that  you  continue  to  do  so.  These                     tremendous  times  are  getting  worse  (January  22,  1917)  urging  us  to  be  more                     recollected and to pray to God with fervent petitions” (Vol. 34, page 112).               235                          He demanded a novena with nine prayers of atonement, the litany of the most                     Holy Name, and the songs (S.C. Vol. 5, page 14). The Father himself preached                     the novena for 34 years in the community where he was dwelling, recommending                     the  houses  of  the  sisters  to  have  at  least  a  triduo  of  preaching.  Writes  Father                     Vitale: “How enraptured he was in the preaching during that feast! Sometimes he                     would blush, his voice would grow dim and his eyes would fill with tears ...To                     inspire his listeners  with love, he analyzed the meaning of the hymn  by Saint                     Bernard...” (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 282).                          On  the  feast,  the  communities  presented  the  great  petition  to  the  eternal                     Father to obtain graces through the merits of the most Holy Name of Jesus. Says                     the Father: “We recommend that the petition be presented and prayed with great                     contrition and holy fervor, with living faith and humble confidence, based on the                     merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, to which the eternal Father denies nothing” (Vol.                     34,  page  112).  Because  the  petition  is  a  devotion  of  our  religious  family,  «  it                     must be done privately at the foot of the altar. To avoid the presence of outsiders,                     the Church's or the Oratory's doors will be closed (Vol. 34, page 153).","The  Father's  final  petition  is  made  of  34  requests  in  favor  of  the                     congregation. Each petition is preceded by a thanksgiving for the graces already                     granted, and is read at noon before the opened tabernacle. On February 1, the                     communities start offering 34 masses to have the petition granted.                          The Father explains:                          Such importance is based on our Lord Jesus Christ's divine promises, who                     said to his disciples, the apostles, and all the Christians till the end of the world:                     “I tell you the truth: the Father will give you whatever you ask of him in my                     name”  (Jn. 16, 23). On another occasion he said: “And I will do whatever you                     ask for in my name” (Jn. 14, 13). He also added: “Till now you have not asked                     for anything in my name; ask and you will receive, so that your happiness                     may be complete” (Jn. 16, 24).                          Not  believing  these  divine  promises  does  not  believe  in  Jesus  Christ's                     divinity.  In  asking  in  the  name  of  our  Lord  means,  asking  through  his  divine                     merits which can obtain everything from the eternal Father. By praying in the                     name of Jesus we join his earthly, perfect prayers which the eternal Father could                     not help granting; now, Jesus repeats his divine petition from the tabernacle, and                     we join them every time we pray in his name, firmly trusting that God will deny                     nothing owing to Jesus' promise. If we have to pray so at any time, with greater          236                     reason we have to do so on the day dedicated to his most Holy Name Vol. 1,                     page 79).                          The  solemn  celebration  of  this  feast  in  the  institute  started  on  January  15,                     1888,  the  second  Sunday  after  the  Epiphany,  and  was  saddened:  during  the                     novena, on the morning of January 9 our founder's mother died.                          We close this topic with the Father's suggestion to the Daughters of Divine                     Zeal, which also counts toward the Rogationists: “The Daughters of Divine Zeal                     must know that this great devotion to the most holy, adorable name of Jesus must                     be in force and fervor in our institute forever, dedicating January to his name,                     celebrating  the  feast  on  January  31,  and  presenting  the  petition  along  with  34                     requests to the Father in the name of Jesus” (Vol. 1, page 81).","5. The child Jesus                                 “I assure you, unless you change and become like little children, you will                     not enter the kingdom of God” (Mt. 18, 3). The Father wrote for us a booklet of                     25 prayers and resolves to implore such a grace from the child Jesus, pledging all                     our cooperation to become as innocent and simple as children. He received such                     a gift from the Lord, and lived the spirit of spiritual infancy.                          Obviously,  he  was  very  tender  toward  the  child  Jesus.  In  Christmas  time,                     when we went to visit the baby Jesus in the manger, (which he wanted in each                     house), he joined us. Then we had to sing the song by Saint Alphonsus:  “I love                     you so much.” His voice sprang from his heart without respecting the value and                     the tune, because his poetic ear so sensitive to poetry had no gift for song. At the                     end  of  the  Christmas  feasts,  on  February  2,  he  carried  the  baby  Jesus  in                     procession and in between prayers and songs he cheered him with acclamations                     such as these: “Long live the baby Jesus... the incarnate word of the Father...                     the son of Immaculate Mary... the delight of our hearts... the lover of our                     hearts...” The string of acclamations was more or less long and all the people                     repeated them, clapping their hands.                                                      237                          He  conceived  a  special  novena  for  the  preparation  of  Christmas.  On                     December 16, reveille was with harmonium or bag-pipes playing the song “You                     come down from the stars...” The sacristan was busy in preparing the tools for                     the novena of nine lamps. During this preparation time, people renounced some                     of  their  fruit,  which  was  distributed  to  the  poor  on  Christmas  Eve.  Then  they                     prepared the cradle, the little mattress, and the pillow in spirit. Perhaps this kind                     of preparation was traditional in Sicily, because I have found a booklet of prayers                     dating  back  to  the  middle  of  the  past  century  which  touched  upon  such                     preparations. But, the Father impressed the mark of his originality upon them. He                     was  not  satisfied  with  the  simple  cradle;  this  should  be  made  of  the  wood                     pleasing Jesus, i. e., that from the Gethsemane olive-grove and specifically the                     tree that will give the wood for the cross, which is the altar of his sacrifice and of                     our salvation.  The practices of the day were:  prayer, penance, good work, etc.                     Each day we were under the protection of a patron saint and said an ejaculatory                     prayer at each act in common.                          The way of preparations explained how to do the practice. Listen:","We will fly back in time on the wings of our faith. We'll land nine days before                     the  incarnate  word  takes  flesh,  but  having  the  knowledge  of  Jesus  that  we  have                     today. We will visit the Bethlehem's grotto where Jesus is to be born, will consider                     the poverty and the pain that the Son of God will undertake for our sake, and will                     prepare  the  necessities  for  his  birth.  We  will  console  him,console  him  with  our                     humble care and love, entreating him to be born not only in Bethlehem's grotto, but                     also  in  our  hearts.  These  must  be  purified  during  the  novena,  and  adorned  with                     practices of piety, such as fervent acts of love and daily Communion. Living faith                     and  devotion  will  improve  these  preparations  for  the  God-child.  To  achieve  our                     goal, we'll ask the most holy Virgin and the Patriarch Saint Joseph to help us.                          On Christmas night we made the following triple offer to the child Jesus:                          1.  The  things  we  have  prepared  during  the  novena  to  comfort  Jesus  in  the                     Bethlehem's grotto.                          2. Our hearts, symbolized by the paper hearts  on which we write our  affections,                     resolves, needs of grace, etc. so that the child Jesus place these hearts in his own, and                     pierce them with eternal love for himself.                          3. A new corporal. We ask the child Jesus to make our hearts pure, white, and neat                     like the corporal cloth. May he find in them the perfume of his virtues and his dwelling.                                                                                                               238                         How many times the Father appealed to the child Jesus when his institute was in                     need! On Christmas  1889, he  asked the child's  special intervention for the institutes'                     sorrowful  conditions.  To  well  understand  it,  we  recall  that  the  Father  was  almost                     obliged  to  neglect  the  institution  because  of  his  brother  John's  sickness.  The                     consequences were so grave that the Father had to start again the work for the institute                     for male orphans on November 29, 1890.                                                             Messina, Dec. 24, 1889                                                      To the infinite love made flesh                                                            Bethlehem of Avignone                                                 (For Saint Joseph's sake: very urgent)                         Most adorable child Jesus:                         I do not know how to start this very humble letter, which I am fortunate to present to                     your divine majesty. To begin with, I confess my iniquity before your infinite glory and                     greatness.                         My sovereign Lord, I thank you for any grace and mercy you grant me. Meanwhile,                     since your infinite kindness inspires confidence in me, I address this very humble letter                     to you in the hope that you will accept it generously.                             My very kind Lord, I am addressing to you the most warm and","fervent prayer because of the painful situation of these communities.                        Such a situation is very afflicting! Children and youth are undisciplined, idle,                     frivolous, lacking leaders and the means for their success, such as work, arts and                     crafts,  whereas  bad  example  is  settled  around  them.  They  are  at  the  mercy  of                     themselves!                        In spite of their improvement for the many teachings they have received, the                     little  girls  now  are  slackening,  idle,  without  work,  and  lacking  the  means  to                     succeed.  They  break  my  heart!  While  they  are  growing,  their  education  is                     decreasing, and their minds become sluggish for lack of instruction.                        The Little Retreat looks to nurture good souls, but what a pity I feel at seeing                     many souls without guidance, direction, and almost at the mercy of themselves!                        What's more, there is something worse: you know it, but let me state it.                          He  recalls  the  depressing  situation  of  the  little  houses  which  stifle  the                     institution, but he is unable to buy them, and concludes:                          Do not delay, O Lord, do not delay! Let us know your will and move hearts                     to help us. Save these communities. Send,  O Lord, the one and those  you are                     going to send!                          Sweetest child, I ask you these graces. Hear me for the sake of Immaculate            239                     Mary and the glorious Patriarch Saint Joseph.                             Humbly kneeling at your feet, your very humble servant and son,                                                                    Hannibal Mary (Vol. 4, page 40).                          The spiritual pilgrimage to Bethlehem dates back to 1899. We explain what it                     is all about.                         The  Father  writes  that  sometimes  he  had  strokes  of  luck  in  devising                     profitable practices of devotion and piety (S.C. Vol. 7, page 241). Such practices                     of  piety  conceived  out  of  spiritual  finesse  and  deep  insight,  foster  the  love  of                     God. The padre's poetic imagination and strong feelings for the highest ideals of                     faith  caused  him  to  create  them  in  a  beautiful  and  engaging  way  to  win  over                     hearts (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 298). The spiritual pilgrimages                     are among his spiritual industries, which the Father conceived when the institute                     was  in  particular  need.  Leaving  from  the  church,  the  sisters  along  with  the                     orphans went through the garden, singing and praying until they reached the spot                     where a picture  or statue of the Virgin Mary  or a  saint was placed. This  spot                     represented the sanctuary. At the end of these practices of piety, all of them came                     back to the church, trustful that they had been granted the grace they'd asked for.                     Sometimes the pilgrimage lasted more than one day (Ibid. page 299).","In  1899,  the  Father  organized  a  spiritual  pilgrimage  to  Bethlehem,  but  no                     prayer or practice remains, except the verses sung in chorus and two stanzas for                     the offer of the hearts. The offer was perhaps made by an orphan girl:                             On tip toe I want to go                            To see Jesus asleep. My heart I want to throw                            In his hand as a loving sheep.                            If he awakens, he will find my heart in his hand,                            Then will look at it from above,                            And will understand                            That he has to renew it in his love.                          The child Jesus is in Saint Anthony of Padua's arms. Everyone runs to ask the                     saint for grace. Are they aware of the child Jesus? That Saint Anthony's power                     comes from the child Jesus? That Saint Anthony derives the graces for his devout                     from the heart of the child Jesus? The Father called the attention of the faithful to                     the  child  Jesus  by  crowning  him  with  a  silver  crown,  while  staying  in  Saint                     Anthony's arms. The Father performed the liturgy on August 15, 1915, feast of                     the Assumption and ... anniversary of Saint Anthony... These ideas are recalled in                     the verses ending with the prayer to the child Jesus. He is entreated to accept the                     crown and the offer of the hearts:                                                                                                               240                            O God-child,                            Your sons and daughters on their part                            Offer you a crown Along with their heart                            And the flowers of the town.                            Kneeling at your feet,                            Your blessing they entreat (S.C. Vol. 2, page 31).                        6. Jesus crucified                         Preaching in Trani, the Father said:                      Dear faithful, we have a book from which all people can learn, the erudite and                             the ignorant,                      great  and  the  little,  just  and  sinners.  It  is  open;  anyone  can  learn  the  most                             sublime","theology of God's attributes: his power, mercy, justice, and charity. It is written                     with                     characters of blood to explain God's eternal love for men.                     This book is the school of divine wisdom and science which formed the greatest                     saints  of  the  Church,  and  without  it  we  are  unable  to  understand  and  practice                     virtues. The teaching of the gospel is condensed and explained in this book. The                     books  of  the  Scripture,  beginning  with  the  Pentateuch  up  to  the  book  of                     Revelation form the pages of this book. The voluminous works of the Fathers of                     the Church, of the doctors, and the sacred ministers originate from these pages;                     their works are nothing but the exposition, the explanation, and the comment on                     this  book.  This  book  formed  the  saints.  What  is  this  book  of  all  sciences  and                     wisdom  in  heaven  and  earth?  The  Crucified,  Christ  Jesus  nailed  to  the  cross!                     (Vol. 13, page 51).                          The Father formed in this divine book. In his common picture, he is holding                     the crucifix in his hands. It is significant, because it shows the characteristic note                     of his holiness, which is enlightened by the Crucified. To love him and to make                     him  known  and  loved  was  the  Father's  aim,  as  it  is  the  saints'.  However,  the                     thought  of  the  Passion  along  with  the  sorrows  of  Jesus  was  as  explicit  and                     immediate in the Father's various activities as to appear as the outstanding feature                     of his interior life. The Crucified was his love, his passion, and all. He had the                     same feelings as Saint Paul for Jesus: “He loved me and gave himself for me”              241                     (Gal. 2, 20).  “If anyone does not love the Lord, let a curse be upon him” (1 Cor.                     16, 22).                          Since his early youth, while teaching catechism to children, the Father liked                     to  show  them  a  great  crucifix.  Pointing  to  the  wounds,  the  nails,  the  thorny                     crown, and the opened heart he made children understand the love of Jesus, who                     suffered the torments  of his Passion and death on the cross, for our salvation.                     Finally, he used to say with a particular tone of voice: “Do you see how much                     Jesus loved us?”                          A former student of Saccano institute remembers that the Father once fainted                     while showing the Crucified to children and speaking of the Passion with tears in                     his eyes. People restored him to consciousness.                           “In  his  report  upon  the  teaching  of  catechism,  he  suggests  that  teachers                     speak to children 'of our Lord Jesus Christ's love for us, of our duty to love him;                     of how painful our Lord's Passion was, and the like” (S.C. VoI. 7, page 259).                          When  he  happened  to  notice  that  people,  especially  consecrated  souls,                     offended the Lord mortally, he worried, more than once saying to us: “Because                     of this, Jesus sweated blood, suffered","bodily  torture,  abandonment  from  his  Father,  and  much  more\"  (Father  Mary                     Hannibal Di Francia, page 283).                          He held the meditation on the Passion as duty every Christian and a source of                     copious good; he worried because the faithful forget it. He wrote,                          Forgetting  the  meditation  on  Jesus  Christ's  sorrows  is  a  displeasing                     ingratitude toward the Lord, and is a reason of his pains in the garden. And yet                     the  meditation  on  Jesus  Christ's  sorrows  should  be  our  daily  bread...  It  is                     incredible, but it is true: if a dear person suffers, you comfort him, worry for him,                     and  share  his  pains,  whereas  we  do  not  shed  a  tear  for  the  love  of  God,  our                     Redeemer, who out of love for us becomes the man of all sorrows (Vol. 10, page                     130).                           The  meditation  on  Jesus  Christ's  Passion  is  more  beneficial  and  effective                     than  any  other  meditation.  Through  it,  beginners  mortify  their  passions,  the                     proficient  improve  in  the  imitation  of  Jesus  Christ,  sinners  are  shaken  and                     converted, the lukewarm are enkindled with divine love, and they just achieve                     union with God)) (Ibid. page 130).                          In the preface to The Labors and Suffering of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the            242                     venerable  Thomas  of  Saint  Augustine,  the  Father  wrote:  “It  is  impossible  to                     persevere  in  this  meditation  at  least  20  minutes  a  day  without  improving  in                     divine love, in interior virtue, and in  hating  sin. The loving Jesus  cannot help                     giving  copious  grace,  enlightenment,  and  eternal  good  to  the  persons  who                     meditate  continuously  upon  the  sorrows  he  endured  for  34  years;  (3)  they                     become dearest and beloved” (S.C. Vol. 9, page 133).                           The chief topic of the Father's preaching was the Passion of our Lord Jesus                     Christ: sometimes he went on the verge of crying, and then he shed tears and                     made us cry.  Every year, when he preached on the Lord's Passion, on the three                     hours of agony, Mater Dolorosa, and the Most Precious Blood, he succeeded in                     moving people to tears (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 283).                          Jesus' Passion was the topic of his daily meditation, which lasted for over an                     hour. Also during the day, in between his business, he recalled the Passion and                     invited people who were with him to do the same.                          Says a sister: “After mass he retired to the chapel.                     Thinking that he was already gone, one day I entered the chapel and found him                     embracing the hanging crucifix. This happened","several times to the sisters, who closed the door to avoid inconvenience and a                     sure reproach.”                          Mother Annunziata of the Missionary Catechists narrated this episode to me:                     “One day the Father went to visit the community of Marsico, but found the house                     closed: the community was on a trip. He spent all day in the cathedral, in the                     chapel of the most holy crucifix. In the evening the sisters apologized, but the                     Father  gladly  said:  “That’s  fine;  it  is  a  great  fortune  to  spend  a  day  with  the                     crucified Jesus.”                          We have already touched upon the picture of Jesus before the tribunal, the                     one  that  the  Father  sent  to  the  Pope.  He  often  meditated  upon  that  picture,                     shedding  tears.  To  teach  us  not  to  complain  for  the  suffering,  but  to  receive                     everything from the hands of God and to join our sorrows to Jesus' sorrows, on                     occasions he drew our attention to the expression of the gospel he kept silent,                     referred  to  Jesus  standing  before  Pilate.  In  the  Rogationists'  Constitutions  is                     written: “Keeping in mind Jesus crucified, the Rogationists will remember that                     their life is a life of sacrifice, not of earthly pleasure.”                          Writing to Mr. Cannizzaro, the Father talks about his own meditation on the                     Passion:                                                                                  243                          In the silence of my room I meditate on the adorable Jesus Christ every day. I                     imagine  myself  in  the  days  when  Jesus  was  living  on  earth.  I  will  see  him                     beautiful,  sweet,  gentle,  walking  on  the  roads  of  Galilee;  teaching,  working                     miracles, transfiguring himself in his divinity on Mount Tabor. I go from Mount                     Tabor to Calvary: first I see him in Gethsemane... When I think of my beloved                     Jesus  Christ,  my  pride  does  not  hinder  me  from  kneeling  at  his  feet.  I  adore,                     thank, and bless him, because God took a human nature for the sake of all and                     mine, and out of love suffered so much, dying on the cross! (S.C. Vol. 5, page                     121).                          He wished that the members of his communities will meditate on the Passion.                     He wrote to the mother superior general of the Bocconiste:                          I deem that the daily morning meditation, necessary to all the Religious, must                     be on the most holy Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ. Nothing else is better to                     enkindle  divine  love,  especially  before  Holy  Communion.  Nor  can  we  better                     achieve the contemplation of our Lord","Jesus  Christ's  infinite  love,  but  through  the  contemplation  of  God  crucified!                     Since  the  Eucharist  is  the  memorial  of  our  Lord's  Passion,  the  meditation  on                     other  subjects  before  receiving  Holy  Communion  seems  unsuitable.  Only                     meditation  on  the  Passion  makes  us  receive  a  greater  advantage  from  the                     Eucharist. I found a few communities which meditate upon other topics. These                     topics,  however,  would  be  suitable  for  spiritual  readings  in  the  refectory,  etc.                     (S.C. Vol. 5, page 223).                      The Father enjoined our communities:                          The morning meditation will be entirely on the most holy Passion of our Lord                     Jesus Christ (Vol. 1, page 27). Do not change the meditation book frequently.                     When you find that one is effective, repeat it several times, because you will not                     lose holy impressions and loving feelings by repeating. It may happen in profane                     readings,  but  usually  not  in  the  spiritual  ones  concerning  the  mysteries  of  our                     faith...  The  more  the  soul  meditates  with  love,  humility,  and  purity  on  Jesus                     Christ and his mysteries, especially the ineffable mystery of his Passion - even                     with the same book and the same words - the more the soul experiences more by                     the  intimate,  sorrowful,  and  loving  impression  of  our  divine  Savior's  limitless                     pain and love... (Vol. 1, page 28).                                                                                                               244                         For this reason the Father preferred the book by Blessed Thomas of Jesus,                     which he reprinted and called golden book. The Father wrote in the preface:                          Through  his  fifty  colloquies,  the  Blessed  pierces  the  hearts  with  so  many                     burning arrows as many are his sentences, his words... He shows so great love to                     the suffering and such an attachment to the cross so as to make the most sheepish                     soul  fall  in  love  with  the  suffering.  The  apostrophes  to  the  cross  and  the                     demonstration of its preciousness are such as to drive souls to love and desire                     Jesus Christ's most holy cross (S.C. Vol. 9, page 136).                          The Father interpreted Blessed Thomas this way, and so he relived the most                     holy Passion of the Savior in himself. He ordered all his communities to use the                     golden book.                          But  his  thought  of  Jesus'  sorrows  was  not  restricted  to  the  morning                     meditation. Says a sister: “He often meditated on the Passion. Usually at 11 a.                     m., while working at his desk, and I was with him for some business, he followed                     Jesus' Passion and invited me to do the same. One day, while traveling he often","talked to me about the Passion. And so he did when he happened to find me in                     the chapel for an hour of atonement.”                         7. The Precious Blood                          and the Sacred Face                                The devotion to the Precious Blood and the Sacred Face is a particular                     aspect of the Passion.                     This is an old devotion in Messina, and Bisazza sang its glories in stanzas which                     are  still  on  the  lips  of  the  citizens.  The  revolution  of  Risorgimento  somehow                     repressed  it,  but  the  pastor  of  Saint  Luke's  revived  it  by  forming  a  Pious                     Association after the sub deacon Hannibal Di Francia preached a novena in that                     church, in 1876 . Besides triduos, speeches, and colloquies, the Father preached                     the novena to the  Precious Blood at least five times. He invoked the Precious                     Blood to be freed from divine punishments and for the conversion of sinners, and                     ordered his communities to say seven Glory be along with the ejaculatory prayer           245                     “We salute Man-God's immaculate blood, precious money for the sinners'                     ransom.”                          After consecrating the month of July to the Precious Blood, the Father also                     ordered the communities to make the evening meditation upon it in that month,                     gave the booklet, “Precious Blood” for this purpose, and wrote:                           “In  these  gloomy  times  we  can  present  our  regards  and  homage  of                     atonement to the most Precious Blood that the divine Savior of our souls shed for                     sinners  with  such  great  suffering;  we  can  also  present  this  great  price  of  our                     ransom to the eternal divine Father for the salvation of the holy Church and of                     the world through numerous holy workers.” (Vol. 34, page 149).                          Now we touch upon his devotion to the Sacred Face. As in the 16th century                     the Lord chose Saint Margaret Mary to make people aware of his Heart's riches,                     so in the past century he chose Sister Mary Saint-Pierre (1816-1848) , a humble                     doorkeeper of Tours Carmel to reveal his adorable Face's beauty. Leon Dupont                     (1797-1876) derived from Sister Mary this devotion, and became","an apostle of it. He was born in Martinica, achieved a doctor's degree in law in                     Paris, and became a magistrate. When his wife and daughter died prematurely, he                     moved to Tours, where he aimed at achieving Christian perfection. As a matter                     of  fact,  his  process  of  beatification  is  in  official  course.  After  receiving  the                     picture  of  the  Sacred  Face  from  Sister  Saint-Pierre,  Dupont  exposed  it  in  his                     house and lit a perpetual light under it. The Lord began working several wonders                     through the oil of that lamp, and people appealed to the Servant of God for it.                     Dupont wrote: “I have distributed more than 8.000 cruets of oil” (S. Pedica, The                     Sacred Face, Marietti, Turin, pages 229-235).                          The Father's devotion to the Sacred Face derives from France, because the                     books  we  read  in  our  communities  refer  to  the  writings  of  Saint-Pierre  and                     Dupont. The Father's devotion to the Sacred Face dates back to 1896. We read in                     the  Father's  notes:  Sacred  Face  Intentions.  Pious  Institution:  “enlightenment                     whether  I  have  to  continue  it  or  not;  increase  of  virtues,  fervor,  divine  love,                     perseverance,  vocations;  clerics;  organization  and  study.  May  the  Sacred  Face                     help me, avoid harm to souls, and make me apt to many things!” Then he lists                     some pious practices in honor of the Sacred Face such as the offer of 30 masses                     in  relation  to  thirty  attributes  of  the  Sacred  Face:  The  Sacred  Face  in  its                     formation,  formed,  born,  shedding  tears,  shining,  growing,  adolescent,                     perspiring,  with  beads  of  perspiration,  sad,  serene,  praying,  zealous,            246                     compassionate,  sighing,  majestic  looking,  transfigured,  charming,  enamored,                     disturbed, resting, sleeping, lifting up its eyes to the Father, speaking, thinking,                     languishing, agonizing, perspiring blood, slapped, spat upon, scratched, flushing,                     printing itself on the Veronica's veil, dying on the cross, dead, buried, resurrected                     and glorious”  (S.C. Vol. 10, pages 3910).                           April  1899:  three  novenas  to  the  Sacred  Face  with  the  prayer  to  Saint                     Gertrude, etc., for the salvation of the institute and the spreading of the Apostolic                     Mass. This note refers to the beginning of the Sacred Alliance, when the Father                     accepted  the  advice  of  Msgr.  Genuardi,  Bishop  of  Acireale,  to  call  the  mass                     celebrated by the bishops Sacred Allied, \" Apostolic.”                          During  the  early  years  of  this  century,  the  worship  to  the  Sacred  Face                     received new life from the publication of « A Soul's Story, » the life of Saint                     Teresa of the child Jesus and of the Sacred Face, as well as from the circulation                     of the Shroud's picture by Sister Genoveffa, a sister of Saint Teresa.","As  soon  as  the  Father  had  the  holy  picture,  he  became  a  eulogist  and  a                     propagator. We quote one of his articles on the Scintilla:                          The devout author of this picture is a Carmelite, sister of the young Carmelite                     Teresa of the child Jesus, who died in the odor of sanctity. She studied the Sacred                     Shroud's photo in detail for over six months. (4)                          Helped by lenses, she has painted the Redeemer's features in detail, caring to                     make no changes, nor additions. It seems that an angel guided her hand. (2)                          Not only the bloody signs, the wounds, the swelling of the right check, the                     bruised nose, and the tumefaction of the right eye stand out in this picture, but                     also the sweet serenity, the deep calm, the profound suffering, and the sublime                     majesty of the Sacred Face. Owing to her patient, loving work, for the first time                     we have the genuine picture of our Lord Jesus Christ in the sepulcher. At sight of                     that picture we cannot help exclaiming: Oh, this is Jesus, this is really Jesus our                     Lord!                          If we look at it with faith and love, we find all the expressions in the divine                     Face.  We  perceive  the  divinity,  the  worries  and  the  torments  of  the  man  of                     sorrows, the sacrifice of the divine victim who immolated himself out of love; we                     can read the story of Jesus suffering from the garden to Calvary. This picture is a       247                     memorial of the most adorable Passion.                          It is impossible to contemplate this divine Face so horribly disfigured by our                     sins without being attracted to it and touched by emotion. Something deep and                     intimate  is  transparent,  which  penetrates  the  innermost  of  the  soul,  arousing  a                     feeling of tenderness. Everyone feels so, and many cry at the sight of it (S.C.                     Vol. 2, page 19).                          Do we know how many tears the Father shed on the Sacred Face's picture?                          He  had  this  picture  exposed  in  our  communities,  and  I  cannot  forget  the                     beneficial  effect  we  youth  received  from  such  a  picture  exposed  in  the  choir,                     where we made our daily meditation.                          The month of April was dedicated to the Sacred Face: we made the evening                     meditation upon it and said a special litany. During the 1908 carnival, at Andria                     (Bari - Italy), some persons made a sacrilegious parody of our Lord's Passion. As                     usual in such circumstances, the Father celebrated a triduo of atonement at the                     altar of the crucifix in the Holy Spirit's Church, adding preaching, prayers, and                     songs. On that occasion he wrote the inspired verses in honor of the Sacred Face:","God-man's Adorable Face,                            Your holy features I embrace.                            I long for you; I die for love, Most Holy Face That I love.                            I want to redeem                            My past life And the many harms                            Of any strife.                            More than in tears,                            In bleeding I want to melt,                            O Jesus, my king (S.C. Vol. 2, page 18).                         8. The Sacred Heart                         Moderm  society's  eagerness  for  reforms  has  caused  confusion  of  ideas  in  all                     branches  of  the  religious  life;  therefore,  it  is  not  surprising  that  the                     beautiful,beneficial  devotion  to  the  Sacred  Heart  has  been  struck  by  negative                     effects.  For  over  80  years  this  devotion  grew  all  over  the  world,  but  today  is   248                     going into reverse.                          The innovators question: “What is the devotion to the Sacred Heart all about?                     It is an old-fashioned, anachronistic practice entirely based on emotion.”                          We, however, are siding with the Church’s “magisterium,” teaching that the                     devotion to the Sacred Heart has very solid theological foundations. The Magna                     Charta  of  this  devotion  is  Annum  Sacrum  (May  25,  1899),  by  Leo  XIII                     prescribing the consecration of the world to the Sacred Heart; Miserentissimus                     Redemptor (May 8, 1928), by Pius XI developing the concept and","the  duty  of  reparation;  and  Haurietis  Aquas  (May  15,  1956),  by  Pius  XII,                     defining  and  explaining  this  devotion.  We  may  also  add  the  apostolic  letter                     Investigabiles Divitias (February 6, 1965), by Paul VI, who after touching upon                     the main features of this devotion complains: “The worship to the Sacred Heart is                     growing  feeble,  but  we  hope  that  it  will  bloom  again.  As  the  Second  Vatican                     Council requires, may people consider it as a most noble practice of piety toward                     Jesus Christ, king and center of all the hearts, head of the body, the Church; he                     who is the beginning, the first-born of the dead, so that primacy may be his in                     everything (Col. 1, 18). Since the holy Council warmly recommends the pious                     practices of Christians... especially when they are according to the Holy See, this                     devotion  is  to  be  recommended,  because  it  adores  and  atones  to  Christ  in  the                     august mystery of the Eucharist.”                          Pius XI taught that the devotion to the Sacred Heart sums up the Catholic                     religion, the rule of perfect life, the easiest way to achieve a deep knowledge of                     Christ the Lord, and the most effective means to make the souls love him more                     intensely and imitate him more faithfully. The worship of the most holy Heart of                     Jesus is worthy to be esteemed as the practical profession of Christianity... On                     the whole, it is the worship of God's love for us through Jesus, and the display of                     our love for God and neighbor (Misericors Redemptor).                          The  devotion  to  the  Sacred  Heart  was  the  queen  devotion  in  the  Father's   249                     heart,  because  it  comes  to  love  for  God  and  neighbor.  Wasn't  that  the  flame                     burning the Father's heart?                          Let  us  quote  some  passages  of  his  apostrophe  when  he  dedicated  and                     consecrated the periodical  God and Neighbor  to the Sacred Heart on June 26,                     1908:                          A superhuman joy spreads in our hearts. Our longing to publish this paper                     comes true on the day consecrated to the Heart that makes the elect happy, and                     gives us good omens of its liking and its merciful blessings.                          God and Neighbor! To whom but to you, O beloved Heart of God made man,                     are we consecrating the first fruits, the progress of this humble magazine, which                     is appearing in the middle of the Catholic press? The consecration we are making                     at  your  feet  is  the  affirmation  of  your  eternal  right,  the  delivery  of  what  is                     eternally yours.                          O sweetest Heart, O clearest mirror of purest charity in its intimate essence,                     please harbor into your gentlest fibers this periodical which aims at two goals in                     the motto: God and Neighbor (S.C. Vol. 1, page I10).","The Father consecrated his institutions to the Sacred Heart even through their                     provisional  names:  “Poor  of  the  Sacred  Heart,  Regular  Clerics  Oblates  of  the                     Heart  of  Jesus”  ;  as  well  as  through  their  final  names,  “  Rogationists  of  the                     Heart of Jesus” and  “Daughters of Divine Zeal of the Heart of Jesus.” (6)                     The Father remarks:  “The specification Heart of Jesus crowns everything” (S.C.                     Vol. 7, page 47).                          He adds: “This title will form our decorum, our ambition, our honor, and the                     rule  of  our  duties.  It  makes  our  devotion  to  the  Heart  of  Jesus  very  tender,                     lovable, and delightful, that Heart which holds the fortunes of our institute and                     disposes of them as he so desires.”                          Because the name is combined with the emblem, the Father exhorts: “Both                     your name and the evangelical  motto urge  you to be very zealous even at the                     sacrifice of your life for the interests of the adorable Heart of Jesus, for his glory,                     and the good of souls” (Vol. 45, page 398).                          The  Father's  love  for  the  Heart  of  Jesus  was  sculpturally  defined:  “The                     Sacred Heart was his heart.” The beats of his heart were consecrated and vivified                     by  the  divine  Heart.  He  was  struck  by  the  Heart  of  Jesus'  tenderness  and                     compassion  as  described  in  the  gospel  through  the  various  episodes  and                     expressions, from which he derived his own tenderness and compassion for all              250                     human misfortunes.                          He made the Sacred Heart the titular of his congregations, and every year he                     prepared the feast with at least a triduo of preaching to foster the fervor in the                     communities: He writes to his daughters: “Today is the feast of the most holy                     Heart of Jesus; I do not know if you applied yourselves to considering what Jesus                     our  Lord  and  his  divine  Heart  mean  to  us.  If  the  precious  sparkle  of  love  for                     Jesus is not lit up in your hearts, everything is useless. We must consider what                     Jesus,  his  love  for  us,  and  the  happiness  of  loving  him  mean  to  us.”  Then  he                     explains  the  nature  of  divine  love:  “Keep  in  mind  that  loving  Jesus  does  not                     mean  to  feel  a  little  sensible  devotion;  nor  the  pleasure  of  doing  nothing,  nor                     staying in the church; on the contrary, it means to be mortified, to be subject to                     obedience,  to  beware  of  any  sin,  to  embrace  the  suffering  of  the  work,  want,                     poverty, contradiction, and any trouble. By doing such things, divine love is lit                     up in the soul and brings consolation to it o (Vol. 34, page 79).","On another occasion:                          On the 21 of May, the month dedicated to the most holy Virgin Mary, we begin the                     novena to the adorable Heart of Jesus, whose feast is on May 30. You know that this                     Heart is all for us, because we are consecrated to him, who is the owner of the institute,                     of  our  labors,  and  intentions.  Our  houses,  orphanages,  day-schools,  and  everything                     belong to the divine Heart. For this reason the novena and the feast of the Sacred Heart                     are of primary importance for us. We recommend our communities to celebrate them                     with particular affection, devotion, and love.                          After seeing that particular prayers and actions in common be done, he adds:                     “Pay careful attention to avoiding any fault in the novena; but do acts of penance                     and love for Jesus, supreme goodness, following one's own devotion” (S.C. Vol.                     8, page 196).                          To give external evidence that everything belongs to the Lord; he exposed                     the statue of the Sacred Heart on the institute's entrance with this inscription: “I                     am the owner of this house and of those who dwell in it and love me.”                           As to the devotion to the Sacred Heart, he declares:                           Nothing  is  sweeter,  gentler,  and  dearer  than  it  to  my  soul.  I  consecrate                     myself to this adorable Heart, to his will, and his most holy wishes. The interests       251                     of this divine Heart will be mine. I will glory in offering myself as a lover, son,                     slave, and victim of this divine Heart, doing my best to make him known and                     loved all over the world  (Vol. 44, page 3 I ).                          The picture of the Sacred Heart had to stand out in our communities. The                     Father liked best the kind printed by Rossi Co. of Milan, where Jesus is standing                     with his blazing heart on the chest in the attitude of protecting, as the Father said                     in the verses:                             Long live the Heart that shows itself                            In so sweet, smiling picture,                            That stretches out its hand from the delf                            As though saying: Children, I'm your cure.                            Do not fear, I am the powerful                            Who broke the hellish door;                            You be to me faithful                            As I was to you before!                          The inauguration of the Sacred Heart in the communities was to be carefully                     prepared.  He  wrote  to  Messina:  “The  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  wants  being                     desired. Therefore, prepare","stanzas, song, petitions, acts of mortification, wishes, etc. He is coming with his                     hands extended  in attitude of divine protection in order to repel the adversary                     powers in these tremendous times. Let us confide, hope, and love him. Woe to us                     if we were ungrateful to him after receiving so many graces! Divine punishments                     are coming.” (Vol. 34, page 100). He wrote these words on January 12, 1915: the                     war was raging in Europe for six months, and Italy got involved the following                     May. How happy he was in crowning the statue of the Sacred Heart in Messina                     in 1912. That statue, however, was lost in the fire at the church!                          On  June  8,  1923,  the  feast  of  the  Sacred  Heart,  the  Italian  Committee  for                     pilgrimages  made  a  Grand  National  pilgrimage  to  Paray-le  Monial.  Then  the                     Father organized the spiritual pilgrimage in the communities, which he longed                     for so many years. The dwelling at Paray should last five days, according to the                     real pilgrimage; they had to spend those days honoring the Sacred Heart of Jesus                     with special visits, songs, sacrifices, etc. From there they would go to Lourdes -                     two days travel and three of dwelling - in union of spirit with the real pilgrimage,                     honoring Immaculate Mary with visits, prayers, and songs. (S.C. Vol. 5, pages 63                     and following).                          We have several volumes of prayers written by the Father. Most of them are                     addressed to the Sacred Heart.                                                                                                               252                       9. Consecration and atonement                                The practices of devotion to the Sacred Heart of primary importance are                     the consecration and the atonement.                     Since he was a cleric, the Father was an apostle of the consecration to the Sacred                     Heart. In fact, the abbess of Citta' di Castello's capuchins wrote to him: “I am                     spreading the many booklets of the consecration to the Sacred Heart which you                     gave  me;  people  like  them.”  Later,  when  the  Father  founded  the  institutes,  he                     made and repeated the consecration several times.","We have various formulas, because the Father adapted them to the needs of                     the institute. We quote the first of them dating back to 1895: “Loving Heart of                     Jesus,  our  Celestial  Friend  (it  was  the  Eucharistic  title  of  that  year),  we                     consecrate ourselves to you, as well as the whole institute along with our hopes                     and wishes for its formation. O most holy Heart of Jesus, Celestial Friend... place                     this little seed into your sweetest Heart and see to it that this Pious Institution of                     your  poor  derive  life  and  existence  from  your  loving  Heart,  for  the  greater                     consolation of your Heart, O Jesus” (Vol. 4, page 50). We also call to mind the                     consecration of 1903 on the institute's 25th anniversary. We find a reference in                     the hymn of that year:                             And you, little unknown spark                            That wanders in the joke of the whirl                            Plunge yourself into my shining ark                            Like one of my Heart's pearl.                            Lost in my fire,                            You will burn in the rapture of love.                            You’re being burnt in my pyre                            Will make you glory in my love.                          As  to  the  atonement,  we  know  how  the  Father  reacted  as  soon  as  public                     offenses  came  to  his  knowledge.  Here  we  remember  our  membership  to  the         253                     “Pious Union of Prayer and Penance” of Paris to honor the Sacred Heart, and the                     fervent prayer we said for a long time along with five Our Fathers, Hail Mary,                     and Glory be on the first Friday of month. On that day we abstained from the                     second dish of food. We also make a reference to the practice of atonement, the                     hour of the watch, the cards of prayer, and the Communion of atonement on the                     first  Friday  of  month  with  particular  intentions,  according  to  our  early  prayer                     book.                          As  Rogationists,  we  have  to  state  the  meaning  of  reparation  exactly.  The                     reparation is of honor or consolation. “The former is a tribute of honor and glory                     to the Sacred Heart of Jesus to counterbalance the dishonor coming from sin. The                     latter is a show of love and comfort to the Sacred Heart to relieve him from his                     sadness because of sins” (Agostini, The Sacred Heart of Jesus, part II, page 277).                     These forms of reparation are part of the devotion to the Sacred Heart, and are                     inseparable  because  they  are  interrelated.  In  fact,  whoever  honors  Jesus,  also                     consoles him, and vice versa. Likewise, the effects of sin, dishonor and sadness,                     are interrelated. This, however, does not prevent people from giving priority to                     honor, or to consolation.” (Ibid.).","Jesus pointed to this consolation when he said to Saint Margaret: “See the                     Heart  that  loved  so  much  humankind...  but  receives  ingratitude  and  insults  in                     return... At least you, give me this consolation to counterbalance them.” These                     considerations help us better understand the spirit of the Father, who only wished                     to do everything for the greater, greatest, and infinite consolation of the Heart of                     Jesus! The Father wished to penetrate the heavens, and reach the throne of the                     Sacred Heart in order to give beats of a new joy to the divine Heart, to add smile                     to his smile, happiness to his happiness, paradise to his paradise, addressing to                     him the beats of his heart and consuming for him the energies of his life in the                     charity for God and neighbor. In the fit of his free zeal for conquering souls to                     the kingdom of love, he waved to the world the banner of the Rogate,” which                     contains all the interests of that divine Heart.”                        10. Inner sorrows                         The devotion to the Sacred Heart is strictly connected with the Passion. Pius XII                     writes: “Besides what has been revealed by Jesus Christ to Saint Gertrude and                     Saint  Margaret  Mary,  we  can  assert  that  no  one  is  able  to  understand  Jesus   254                     crucified, but those who understand the mystical secrets of his Heart.” (Haurietis                     aquas).                          The bodily Passion of our Lord is understood and fulfilled by the Passion of                     his  Heart.  Says  the  Father:  “The  Passion  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  has  three                     perspectives: the first one is formed by the very cruel suffering of Jesus Christ's                     most  holy  human  nature;  the  second,  is  formed  by  the  insults  and  infamy  he                     suffered out of love for us; the third, is formed by the inconsolable sorrows of his                     soul and Heart.” (S.C. Vol. 9, page 134).                      These are defined by the Father as inner sorrows of the Heart of Jesus, and their                     nature is explained thus:","During  his  life  -  the  nine  months  in  his  mother's  womb  included  -  Jesus                     suffered in his divine Heart an abyss of interior sorrows so intense that he could                     have  died  at  any  moment  of  pure  pain  if  his  divine  omnipotence  had  not                     maintained his life up to the last moment. The prophets announced beforehand                     such  suffering  through  expressive  terms  and  images.  The  bitterest  waters  that                     flooded Jesus Christ's most holy soul derived from several sources. According to                     the revelation granted to the Blessed Villani, the main sources were: 1) The sight                     of all sins that Jesus took on himself as if he were responsible for them in the                     eyes of his Father's justice. 2) Human ingratitude for his love and suffering, of                     which  the  prophet  David  had  said:    “What  has  the  shedding  of  my  blood                     gained?” 3) The sight of so many souls who are lost eternally, which made him                     say through the mouth of the prophet: “The pains of hell surrounded me!” 4) The                     fearful sight of his coming Passion and death, which were always present in his                     mind through the divine vision in such a way that he suffered them all his life. To                     these sorrows that oppressed his divine Heart other sorrows were joined, such as:                     the sight of his most holy Mother's sorrows, the Queen of Martyrs, who was the                     only one able to penetrate in depth the abyss of his intimate sorrows; the sorrows                     and  the  torments  that  the  elects  on  earth  and  in  purgatory  had  to  suffer;  the                     ingratitude,  ruin,  and  dispersion  of  his  beloved  people  Israel;  the  ingratitude,                     obstinacy, and loss of Judas; and so many other causes oppressed the Heart of                     Jesus! (Vol. 44, page 103). The meditation upon these ineffable pains forms the                     special character of this humble, small institute, considering it as a special gift of    255                     the Lord... Going deeply into this singular, ceaseless, inexpressible suffering of                     the most holy Heart of Jesus is a great gift and mercy of God, who moves the                     soul to great compassion, gratitude, and love (S.C. Vol. 10, pages 185-186).                         The  Father  went  so  deeply  into  it  that  even  his  external  features  were                     affected; his eyes were wet with tears, and his face grew pale. He taught us that                     the Rogate derives zeal from the meditation on the inner sorrows:                         This  institute's  particular  spirit,  which  conforms  to  the  saying  of  our  Lord                     Jesus  Christ,  “Pray,  therefore,”  is  bound  to  the  meditation  on  the  intimate                     sorrows of Jesus' Heart. By going deeply in these sorrows the congregants cannot                     he apathetic before the interests of the Divine Heart. They instead feel and share                     them, and are moved to sacrifice themselves for the divine interests. The divine                     saying resounds to their ears and makes them obey that command to console the                     most holy Heart of Jesus in his sorrows. This prayer aims directly at the greater                     glory of God and at the sanctification of souls in the interests of the most holy                     Heart of Jesus (S.C. Vo1.10, page 186).","Notes                          (1)  See Rogationist Anthology, page 89, note (1)                      (2)  We recall the very beautiful act of love published in Rogationist Anthology, page 90, note (3).                      (3)  The Father talks of 34 years of suffering, because the whole life of Christ was a cross and martyrdom.                        He stretches out his meditation and compassion for the beloved Jesus to all his suffering, beginning                        with the incarnation up to his death on the cross.                      (4)  She had more than one photo. Her uncle Guerin gave Celina  The Shroud of Christ by M. Vignon                        along with numerous plates reproducing into positive forms the negative ones impressed on the cloth                        imbued with aromas (P. PIAT, Celina, sister and witness of Saint Teresa of the child Jesus, page 99).                      (5)  We read that Celina mobilized heavens to get help, placing every night brushes and canvas before the                        Virgin of the Smile, and taking it to the Blessed Sacrament as to submit it to divine radiation. She                        also appealed to Saint Joseph, the celestial army, and even to her own family. When the labor grew                        hard, she thought of the Madonna in sorrow on Calvary. In that period of time, which lasted a few                        months,  she  happened  to  see  three  or  four  times  before  herself  for  a  minute,  but  not  through  the                        bodily  eyes,  the  Face  of  Jesus  suffering,  charming  with  beauty  and  clearness.  Finally,  when  she                        finished the picture, she took it to the holy Virgin as a first fruit. We do not know whether her vision                        depended on her imagination excited by the work, or by a special privilege as a recompense for her                        toiling” (PIAT, quoted work, page 101). The Father ignored all this, but he hit the target by writing                        that an angel guided Celina's hand. The picture turned out to be a masterpiece, which won the Great   256                        Prize at the international exhibition of religious art at Hertogenbosh in Olanda, in March 1909.

The Father, however, pointed out that zeal is the zeal of the Heart                        of Jesus.","9.

We have to dedicate at least a chapter to the Father's Eucharistic life. We                     realize  the  feelings  of  his  heart  from  the  reading  of  his  prescriptions  to  his                     children about the worship of the Blessed Sacrament.                      The center of all devotions and activities will be the Holy Sacrament; our order                     will love, honor, and court the Holy Sacrament with such a bliss as to be called a                     Eucharistic Order. Besides the yearly feasts of the most Holy Sacrament, the                     spreading of its worship and daily Communion, the order will celebrate the real                     presence of the most Holy Sacrament through the Eucharistic Day on July First,                     as we have been doing from the beginning of the order (Vol. 3, page 17).                      For the Daughters of Divine Zeal and for those who live with them may Jesus in                     the  Sacrament  be  the  mystical  beehive,  around  which  they  rotate,  resting  and                     producing the sweetest honey of the virtues that please Jesus, supreme goodness                     (Vol. 1. page 98).                                                                        258                      The Father points out the Blessed Sacrament's action in the institute:                      The loving, fruitful, dutiful, and continuous center of this pious institute of Jesus'                     interests is Jesus in the Holy Sacrament. From now on, people must know that                     the true, effective, and immediate founder of this pious institute is Jesus in the                     Holy Sacrament. Of this foundation we may say: “God did something new.” In                     fact, usually he places a founder rich with his graces and gifts in his institutions;                     this institute instead, which was born to promote his Heart's divine command that                     has  been  neglected  for  so  many  centuries,  has  our  Lord  himself  in  the  sacred                     tabernacle  as  the  real  founder.  Graces,  help,  enlightenment,  and  providence                     poured out from his divine heart in the Sacrament (Vol. 1, page 96).                      Please pay attention to the report of the priest promoter, or better yet, to the priest                     who set things moving under the Lord's initiative.","This pious institute's trials sometimes were very sorrowful, and it lasted about 25                     years; but its divine founder, Jesus in the Sacrament, supported and helped his                     foundation in everything... The trial became extreme and most suffocating after                     22  years.  The  priest's  last  means  was  resorting  to  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament.  He                     wrote  the  most  fervent,  cogent,  convincing  petition  to  touch  the  innermost                     feelings  of  Jesus'  Heart  in  the  Sacrament  as  with  an  arrow;  after  opening  the                     tabernacle - God forgive, if it happened so - or perhaps after Holy Communion                     during the mass, he placed that petition under the sacred pyx.                      Jesus accepted it. Since then, the sky began clearing, and Jesus in the host began                     spreading new splendors, which became beams of light, grace, and providence.                     The institute began increasing.                      All this has been written to perpetuate the memory of it, and to make each one                     bear  in  mind  that  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament  is  the  author  of  this  pious  institute,                     which is consecrated to his divine, real heart (Vol. I , page 98).                        2.  Seraphic worshiper                             of the Eucharist                                                                   259                              Going into details, first of all we point out the Father's faith and love for                     the Blessed Sacrament. The Father was a seraphic worshiper of the Eucharist.                     When a youth, he was a regular worshiper in the churches having forty hours of                     adoration,  but  he  preferred  the  churches  of  Portosalvo  and  of  Jesus  and  Mary                     delle Trombe officiated by holy Religious, from whom he took advice.                      Passing  by,  he  seized  the  opportunity  to  visit  the  Blessed  Sacrament  in  the                     churches, even though for a little while.                      In the public adoration, he knelt in a straight angelic edifying attitude, the palms                     joined  or  leaning  on  his  forehead.  When  alone,  sometimes  he  bowed  to  the                     ground, or raised his arms, or crossed them on his chest, always praying in deep                     recollection.                      Coming  out  from  the  adoration,  or  thanksgiving  after  mass,  he  was  bright,                     transfigured  in  the  face.  He  said:  “Being  half  an  hour  before  Jesus  in  the                     sacrament is really delightful!”                      Sometimes the people saw him kneeling four to five hours","before the exposed Blessed Sacrament, and on July first, he spent all day long in                     adoration. In his last years, the Father said to Father Vitale: “I feel weak in the                     legs, perhaps from my long kneeling during my life.” When the Father was in the                     house, he visited the Blessed Sacrament very often, spending his leisure time in                     prayer.                      Both at his leaving and coming back, the Father always passed by the chapel for                     a while, and such a usage was prescribed in the rules for the congregants.                      He once arrived worn out to Ritiro. Father D'Agostino told him to sit and rest,                     but he went to the church where he spent a long while despite his pneumonia.                     Later, he was forced to go to bed for a long time.                      When people were already sleeping, he often spent much time in the chapel, his                     daily hard labor notwithstanding; but when the needs of the institute and of souls                     were urgent, he prolonged his prayers and adoration much more.                     How  passionate  and  ardent  are  the  numerous  petitions  and  invocations  he                     addressed  to  Jesus  in  the  sacrament!  They  shine  with  his  faith  and  vibrating                     heart!                      What can we, say of the Father's fervor when he spoke of the Blessed Sacrament            260                     ? Our souls were penetrated by his words, and we were delighted in listening to                     him.                      When Father Caudo was a seminarian, he went to Avignone for the feast on July                     first and listened to the Father, who preached before giving the blessing with the                     Eucharist. He deeply felt as though the Father were speaking with our Lord, and                     such a feeling lasted in him all his life, which ended at ninety years of age.                     Two singular evidences:                      “Oh, how his eloquence lit up before the divine Host exposed on the altar; it was                     simple  in  a  deep  thought,  calm  in  a  lively  ardor,  charming  in  a  harmonious                     timbre of voice, and very apt to convert people through the crystalline candor of                     each word!” (Father Cosimo Spina).                      His  conversation  was  brief,  but  when  it  came  round  to  the  subject  of  the                     Eucharist, then he became so excited that his words seemed to be fiery as arrows                     coming out of a furnace burning in his chest. The last time I met him, he seemed                     to me as a holy priest bearing the sacred species, so engrossed in his recollection","was he. The habit of virtue had already made him so impermeable that evil could                     not contaminate him. He had become so spiritual that it was hard for him to stay                     in a corporal life. » (Teacher Joseph Giannini).                        3. Deep and ingenuous faith                                The Father's Eucharistic faith was so deep and ingenuous! For instance, he                     placed the pyx in the back of the tabernacle not to close the door in the face of                     Jesus.                            Being tall, he did so easily. One day, however, Father Messina was unable                     to bring the pyx out of the tabernacle because he was short, and complained to                     the Father, who answered: « Do you think it is right to shut the door in the face                     of a very worthy person ? We should observe etiquette with Jesus; you may use                     the footstool, which is under the table, and observe etiquette. »                             More than once people saw him walking backward in the church not to                     turn his back to our Lord, and a sister says that she never saw him turning his                     back to  the Blessed Sacrament.  For this reason he  told the sisters at the Holy         261                     Spirit to go out of the chapel from the side door.                             When coming back from traveling he happened to find the community in                     the courtyard paying respect to him, he used to say a few words of greeting, and                     added: «Jesus is waiting, I will see you later! » Almost always, we followed him                     to pay devout homage to our Lord.                             As to the genuflection, he was rigorous: he did not admit incomplete ones,                     which are but a hint of the liturgical action. Until 1924, the Father was able to                     genuflect  by  touching  the  ground  with  his  knee,  or  better  yet,  by  hitting  the                     predella with his knee and bowing his head.                             A  sister  reports:    «  One  day  the  Father  sent  me  to  the  sacristy  for  his                     glasses.  Passing  in  a  hurry  in  front  of  the  altar,  I  did  not  genuflect  well.                     Immediately he called me back and told me:        Don't you know that the Lord is                     over there, and we have to treat him with importance ? » Two sisters carrying a                     big bunch of flowers passed in front of the tabernacle, bowing their heads.","The Servant of God invited them warmly to pay five minutes of reverence to the                     Lord.                             When I was in Oria, one evening the Father was in the choir while we said                     the nightly prayers. From there he saw that some of the children did not genuflect                     well in front of the altar. He descended from the choir, called all of us back, and                     made us repeat the genuflection.                             Paying visits to Jesus, sometimes he lighted the candles and opened the                     tabernacle. « More than once I have seen him kneeling in the chapel late in the                     night; we said to ourselves that he had all the candles lit to be more fervent in                     prayer while staying alone for long time.  » Mother Nazzarena confided to me                     that now and then he locked himself in the chapel, put on the surplice and the                     stole, lighted the candles, and began praying with raised hands, or prone on the                     ground. He happened to do so, perhaps when the creditors were urgent or in case                     of necessity. On such circumstances, he wanted no one to disturb him.                             He  liked  exposing  the  Blessed  Sacrament,  and  ordered  all  his                     communities to make an hour of solemn adoration once a month, preferably on                     the retreat-day. When he was present, he himself gave the Eucharistic blessing.                     During the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament we had to say our vocal prayers                     more slowly and devoutly. I never forgot my first meeting with the Father. I was          262                     twelve  when  I  traveled  with  him  from  Bisceglie  to  Oria.  Getting  close  to  the                     towns, he looked out of the window in search of the church, and said: « You see,                     Jesus  is  over  there;  let  us  greet  him.  Perhaps,  at  this  time,  he  is  alone,                     abandoned... » And he suggested ejaculatory prayers.                        4. July first, 1886                                The outcome of the Father's Eucharistic life is his institute's Eucharistic                     life, which began and developed this way:                     We call to mind that his institution was born among the very poor of Avignone,                     where the Father opened and dedicated","a humble oratory to the Sacred Heart for the instruction of that mob and for the                     celebration of the holy mass, which was said the first time on March 19, 1881.                      «Thus,  Jesus  in  the  Holy  Sacrament  began  taking  possession  of  those  places,                     sowing the seed of this new plant in the poor's field. The sporadic celebration of                     mass  was  the  sporadic  presence  of  Jesus;  but  his  permanent  presence  in  the                     Eucharistic Sacrament was indispensable for the seed to take root and fructify »                     (Vol. 1, page 96). Father Cusmano, visiting Avignone exclaimed: « How can you                     stay here without the Blessed Sacrament in your midst ? » We can imagine how                     the padre longed for him! » (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 82).                             Therefore  it  was  an  instant  wish  of  all  of  us  to  have  the  Blessed  Sacrament                     permanently  in  the  chapel.  The  starter  of  this  institution  was  preoccupied  by  this                     thought.  Truly,  it  would  have  been  very  easy  to  bring  the  Blessed  Sacrament  to                     Avignone; all it would have taken was the permission of the ecclesiastical authority. But                     the starter of the institution judged that the permanent dwelling of Jesus in the Holy                     Sacrament among the poor and the children should be preceded by lengthy preparations                     to  move  souls  upon  its  arrival.  He  judged  that  the  Blessed  Sacrament's  appearance                     should be an event, because our Lord Jesus Christ would be in the very midst of the                     poor, becoming poor himself in these hovels for the sake of his desolate children.                             Therefore, we began exciting the children's holy anticipation by means of pious    263                     industry e. g. teaching the importance of the coming event and exhorting faith, love, and                     desire  for  Jesus.  To  achieve  this,  some  verses  were  set  to  music;  the  first  lines  are                     printed below:                      Heaven of heavens, unfold,                     Descend on us our delight...                             It was a very loving call; so many innocent, humble souls sang it to draw Jesus                     down into their midst. A similar prayer from the Song of Solomon was added and said                     every day. Meanwhile, a choir of female orphans was added to the oratory; the altar was                     adorned; in short, the little church became acceptable.                             Perhaps by divine disposition, July first, 1886 was chosen for the happy event.                     Both  preparation  and  anticipation  were  growing  with  great  fervor.  A  hymn  was                     prepared to be sung at the moment the Blessed Sacrament was placed in the tabernacle.                      That day was unforgettable.                             Well  dressed  male  and  female  orphans  waited  for  the  great  event;  the                     surroundings  were  immaculate.  At  about  7:00  a.  m.,  the  priest  climbed  the  altar  to                     sacrifice  the  Lamb  of  God  so  that  he  could  dwell  in  the  midst  of  his  poor.  With                     harmonious accompaniment, the innocent voices sang:","Heaven of heavens, unfold,                            Descend on us our delight...                             Hymns and invitations to come down to the host succeeded one another.                             At the moment of the consecration, when the victim under the species of bread                     and wine was held up, the moving song of expectation was transformed into a song of                     rejoicing:                             Stop now the tears,                            Stop now the pain,                            Sing the new era                            Of peace really true.                            Era of holy reign                            Jesus is at our view.                             After a proper exhortation by the priest, male and female orphans received the                     bread of the angels.  After communion,  the priest  made an appropriate speech during                     which he explained the good fortune of those in the Quarter, the transformation of the                     slum into the royal palace of the king of all ings and the adorable Savior of souls in their                     midst. Hence it was their duty to keep him company.                             The Blessed Sacrament was placed in a solid silver monstrance that a pilgrim       264                     lady had donated to the poor the previous year along with a pyx and a silver censer.                             Shortly  after  the  presentation  of  the  Blessed  Sacrament,  male  and  female                     orphans  holding  candles  as  well  as  the  poor  who  encircled  them,  walked  before  the                     Blessed Sacrament through the alleys of Avignone and a street of the city.                             After  a  short  walk,  the  procession  returned  to  the  chapel;  the  Eucharist  was                     placed on the throne among burning candles and remained exposed all day long. Hymns                     were sung and prayers were said one after another as the children and adults worshiped                     the Lord. That day, they had no time to prepare dinner, but the children were happy to                     have a snack instead as not to divert anyone from the adoration.                             In the evening, the solemn benediction concluded the memorable day.                             The modest solemnity, however, did not end that day. Because the expectation                     for the Blessed Sacrament had lasted two years, the celebration had to be long; indeed,                     it continued until Sunday. To entertain the children, a pulpit was set up in the alley near                     the oratory; in the afternoon, dressed as altar boys, children made short speeches about                     the arrival of the Blessed Sacrament.                             The  girls  did  the  same  in  their  institution,  as  many  ladies  and  gentlemen                     attended.","On  Sunday,  the  last  day  of  the  celebration,  both  male  and  female                     communities,  each  in  the  alley  behind  their  respective  shelter,  had  dinner                     outdoors, happily making appropriate toasts. Zancone, the first poor man met in                     Avignone, sat at the head of the table. In the afternoon, speeches were given; in                     the evening, an exhortation and a solemn benediction concluded the feast. By this                     time,  the  institution  was  in  the  Creator's  hands  (From  a  Father's  booklet:  The                     Feast on July First, etc.).                             To  have  a  permanent,  accurate  memory  of  that  day  well  worth                     remembering as well as to revive the excitement of that event, a memorial tablet                     of thanksgiving was placed on the wall of the oratory.                             Some days later, an announcement was mailed to friends of the institution,                     both ecclesiastical and civil, informing them about the event and inviting them to                     praise  and  thank  God  for  the  great  gift  given  to  the  poor.  This  was  the                     announcement:  «  Our  hearts  rejoicing  inexpressibly,  we  bring  good  tidings  to                     you.  On  July  first,  octave  of  Corpus  Christi  and  eve  of  the  Visitation  of  Our                     Lady, we had the good fortune of witnessing the permanent arrival of our Lord                     Jesus  Christ  in  the  Blessed  Sacrament  in  our  little  church  in  the  Avignone                     Quarter. Join us  while praising  God and our beloved  Jesus,  who is pleased  to                     dwell lovingly in the midst of the poor men, women and children. »                        265                             In  the  first  days  of  August,  the  Father  organized  a  solemn  novena  of                     thanksgiving < to the Lord in the Sacrament for having placed his dwelling in the                     Avignone  Quarter,  well  known  before  as  a  center  of  abjection.  The  preachers                     were Canon Di Francia and Father Pulito » (The Light, August 14, 1886). (3)                        5. The feast of July first                                Those who have not known the Father can hardly realize the importance                     he attached to the memorable date of July first, 1886.                            We have said that since that event < the institution was in the Creator's                     hands. » The Father develops this idea:","Jesus came to remain permanently. He came as a king to set his kingdom                     in the midst of his citizens, as a good shepherd to feed the sheep entrusted to him,                     the flock that had to live with him without fear. He came as the divine farmer to                     cultivate his little plant, which had the seed of his divine ROGATE in suffering                     and mortification.                             He  came  as  a  very  loving  father  in  the  midst  of  his  children  to form  a                     small family living on his body and blood, and to make it able to receive from his                     divine lips the command of his heart's divine zeal: PRAY, THEREFORE, TO                     THE OWNER OF THE HARVEST THAT HE WILL SEND OUT WORKERS                     TO GATHER. IN HIS HARVEST. » This command is strictly connected with                     Jesus in the Sacrament, which cannot exist without the priesthood.                             When Jesus came in the Sacrament, the pious institute was yet a bambino                     in  the  number  of  its  members,  but,  it  rose  as  a  small  caravan  to  start  a  very                     intricate pilgrimage. It was always supported by the true Ark of the Covenant,                     which was not containing the symbolical manna, but the real bread from heaven                     (Vol. 1, page 97).                             Hence the origin of the feast on July first in the institute, which the Father                     wanted to be of first rate. Listen: « It is peculiar to human weakness growing                     feeble in the fervor, unless powerful motives keep it. For this reason, by celestial      266                     wisdom the Church celebrates the mysteries of our faith every year. By the same                     principle it was established that the happy event of July first which stroke people                     so favorably should be remembered every year to foster faith and piety toward                     Jesus in the sacrament and the most holy Virgin Mary » (Feast on July first, etc.).                             The intentions of this happy commemoration were specified by the Father:                             The  order,  the  congregants,  and  the  houses,  no  one  excepted,  offer  this                     yearly tribute of love and faith to the adorable Jesus in the Sacrament, who is the                     center  of  the  institute's  love,  sacrifices,  atonements,  thanksgivings,  petitions,                     prayers, practices of piety,  and holy  hopes.  He is the fountain of the past and                     present graces, mercies, and favors as well as of the future graces that he will                     pour out on this pious institute and its members. This feast is the expression of                     our gratitude for Jesus' loving sweetest dwelling in the midst of us despite our                     failings and unfaithfulness, our languid faith and incomplete answer to his love                     and inspirations (Vol. 1, page 104).                             We report a few evidences of this feast: « The Father made the Eucharist                     the vital center of the institute, and established the","happy  feasts  on  July  first  to  commemorate  the  first  coming  of  Jesus  in  the                     sacrament  to  the  Avignone  Quarter  after  two  years  of  preparation.  »  «  To                     understand  how  the  worship  was  zealously  cared,  was  enough  to  see  how  the                     Father made the return of Jesus in the sacrament solemn; he was the life and the                     soul of everything and all. » < The feast on July first prepared by the Father's                     exhortations excited even the children with enthusiasm ! »                        6. Expectation                                The  feast  of  July  first  is  preceded  by  the  para-liturgy  of  the  Empty                     Tabernacle » in the last days of June. The Father writes: « The previous night,                     the members of the community keep a vigil of adoration and thanksgiving for the                     dwelling of Jesus in the sacrament, according to their own fervor » (Vol. 1, page                     105). On the following day, the priest consumes all the hosts during the mass of                     the  community  and  purifies  the  pyx,  while  the  lamps  are  blown  out.  Then  he                     addresses the community tenderly and pathetically, asking: Where is our treasure                     ? The tabernacle, where Jesus dwelt with us by day and by night, is empty. For            267                     about 15 minutes, the preacher helps the community understand the difference                     that  the  presence  of  the  Blessed  Sacrament  makes.  People  feel  this  touching                     liturgy  always  new,  and  some  of  them  find  themselves  with  their  eyes  wet.                     Because  people  cannot  make  an  act  of  faith  once  for  all,  the  preacher  excites                     their wish to have Jesus again in the sacrament, and concludes his speech with                     the verses:                      Heaven of heavens, unfold,                     Descend on us our delight,                     Hidden in the host, martyr                     Of his divine plight;                     See your children's glamour,                     Our beloved Savior!                             «  At  the  end  of  mass  and  of  the  thanksgiving  for  Communion,  people                     begin adorning the oratory. Those are days of expectation for the coming of Jesus                     in the Blessed Sacrament,","and persons more fervent and with spirit of understanding consider themselves to                     be in mourning. Entering the church two or three times a day, we sing the song                     Heaven of heavens, unfold... and say the prayer for the coming of Jesus in the                     sacrament.  Meanwhile  all  prepare  themselves  for  July  first  by  purifying  their                     conscience» (The Feast on July First). In a circular of 1913, the Father described                     the days of expectation: « In the days of absence and deprivation of our supreme                     goodness in the sacrament, the communities will be in holy expectation, keeping                     silence, praying, singing, and paying visits before the empty tabernacle, having a                     little, moderate recreation, ; they will purify their conscience for the coming of                     Jesus in the sacrament by going to confession. When it is possible, they keep a                     nightly  vigil  of  adoration  for  about  an  hour  before  the  open  tabernacle,  also                     saying special prayers to the most holy Virgin » (S.C. Vol. 5, page 19).                             Father Vitale remarks:                             Through such a preparation, the Servant of God aimed at making people                     understand  the  difference  made  by  the  empty  tabernacle  and  the  tabernacle                     inhabited  by  Jesus.  When  the  tabernacle  is  empty,  the  king  of  the  house,  the                     father, the benefactor, the light, the friend, and all is out; hence the longing of                     hearts for the coming of Jesus among us to fill the afflicting gap.                                                                                                               268                            The  removal  of  the  Blessed  Sacrament  from  the  holy  tabernacle  of  a                     public church could raise inconveniences; therefore, the Father cared to have a                     semipublic sacramental oratory, also to dispose of it for this paraliturgy, which                     was of great importance in his way of thinking. The bishop of Oria, Msgr. Di                     Tommaso, always so compliant with the Father, denied the community of Saint                     Benedict to perform this liturgy for a few years, owing to personal reasons. How                     great  was  the  grief  of  the  Father  and  of  that  community  who  increased  their                     prayers and sighs to heaven, imploring such a grace.                             What a feast they had when the bishop finally consented, and he himself                     celebrated  the  mass,  placing  Jesus  in  that  tabernacle!  Unable  to  intervene,  the                     Father  was  spiritually  present  sending  the  verses  for  the  song  and  a  letter  of                     thanksgiving to the bishop (Vol. 29, page 71). « Later, when he came to Oria and                     celebrated  mass  at  that  altar,  we  were  delighted  together  with  him.  »  -  says  a                     witness.","7. Title of the year                         ‘One of the preparations for the pious solemnity is vital, and makes people feel                     the commemoration always new: it is the title of the year given to the Son of God                     made man and returning in the midst of his poor through the Blessed Sacrament.                     The chapel began having the Sacrament on July first 1886, and the first title was                     given  on  the  first  anniversary  in  1887.  Every  year,  on  May  first,  the  spiritual                     father of the institution communicates the new title in the church at the end of the                     mass. The thrill of expectation turns into enthusiasm, and the community starts                     preparing for the feast of July first with preaching, songs, etc. Also the most holy                     Virgin is given an analogous title » (The feast of July first).                             Saint Joseph, Saint Michael the Archangel, and Saint Anthony were given                     a  title  sometimes.  The  hymns  were  written  by  the  Father,  whereas  the  little                     sermons  were  also  written  by  cooperators.  The  volume  Hymns  of  July  First                     contains the verses the Father wrote for our Eucharistic feast from 1887 to 1926.                     He poured into them his love for Jesus and the Madonna.                             First  July  morning  revives  the  event  of  July  first  1886:  we  have  the   269                     coming of Jesus in the Sacrament, the song of the new hymn, and the exposition                     of the Blessed Sacrament for the adoration during the day. The feast ends on a                     Sunday  in July with speeches,  declamation  of the hymns, etc. Sometimes, be-                     cause the declaimers did not satisfy the Father, he himself recited. For the female                     communities, the Father wrote The Daughters of Jerusalem, a graceful play, and                     the melodrama Jesus, the celestial spouse of the elect souls for the silver anniver-                     sary, in 1911.                             Since the presence of the Blessed Sacrament in the institution should be                     praised  every  day,  the  Father  ordered  the  communities  to  say  this  ejaculatory                     prayer after entering and before going out of the church:g « Let us praise and                     thank  in  any  moment  the  most  holy  and  divine  Sacrament,  which  deigned  to                     come and dwell among us. » We also said a prayer every day for thanksgiving.                     Such a prayer and the words « which deigned to come and dwell among us >>                     were taken out of our prayer book when it was reformed. (4)","The  last  title  given  by  the  Father  was  «  Most  Perfect  Performer  of  his                     Father's Will, » in 1927; the following years, the title was given by Father Vitale.                             However, a sealed card was found among the notes of the Father, which                     read: « To be opened after my death by the successor. » People imagined all sorts                     of secrets, but when the card was opened, something worthy remembering the                     Father's piety was read: « Divine Rogationist. »                             Obviously, it was a title for July first, which the Father reserved for after                     his own death to thank again our Lord for having entrusted to him the mission of                     the Rogate. This title was given to Jesus in 1930.                             For  plausible  reasons,  the  feast  on  July  first  has  been  changed,  always                     remaining a solemn Eucharistic day for our communities. No titles are given to                     Jesus, as it has been for 50 years, but he reigns in the institute with the perpetual                     title  of  Divine  Triumphant,  which  sums  up  the  previous  titles,  concludes  their                     series, and reminds us of Jesus' rights, victories, and triumphs in our institute.                             I feel drawn by a mere coincidence to see the Father's intervention in this                     final title. After his death, it was the turn of Father Vitale to choose the title of     270                     the year for our Lord. He testifies,                             « I deemed to give him the final title of Divine Triumphant, which should                     remain for ever. Some time later, to my great surprise I found a slip of paper,                     which in the Servant of God's handwriting read: Divine Triumphant. Perhaps that                     was the title he had chosen for the year or for the future, since he had said that                     the titles should come to an end. »                             We conclude this section with the Father's words at the end of his booklet                     The feast of July First, pointing out its good results and importance:                             «  This  family  party  on  July  first  has  been  an  occasion  to  revive  faith,                     fervor,  and  affection  to  our  own  institute.  The  foundation  has  almost  been                     enlivened.  More  than  once  I  have  remembered  the  words  of  the  prophet                     Habakkuk: « Lord, enliven your work in the middle of years.' Amen. »","8. In honor of the Blessed Sacrament                                Let  us  touch  upon  other  manifestations  of  the  Father's  Eucharistic                     worship. He printed and spread the prayer book by Saint Alphonsus, Visits to the                     most holy Sacrament. '                             «  Upon  agreement  with  the  bishops  of  the  dioceses  where  he  went                     preaching,  the  Father  organized  a  Eucharistic  procession  in  order  to  gather                     people,  especially  men.  Shortly  after  he  spoke  like  a  seraph,  filling  with                     enthusiasm the crowd willing to listen to him at a greater length. »                             Sister Ignazia of the Daughters of the Sacred Side reports in detail what                     happened at Marsiconuovo when they inaugurated the sacramental chapel after a                     preparation  with  prayers  and  songs.  At  the  end  of  the  Eucharistic  day  of                     September  15,  1915,  the  procession  with  the  Blessed  Sacrament  and  the                     participation of the authorities was ready, but the chapter of the canons had not                     come  yet.  An  idea  crossed  the  Father's  mind.  He  told  Sister  Ignazia:  «  Sister,                     bring  the  torches,  then  lead  the  procession  through  the  house  with  the  censer,                     going  to  the  public  square.  »  When  they  brought  the  torches,  the  Father       271                     addressed the authorities: « You, gentlemen, have the honor to accompany the                     Lord,  bearing  the  torches!  »  A  death  like  silence  reigned  for  a  few  moments.                     Most of them were socialists not accustomed to such a parade; yet, each of them                     picked up a torch and went into the public. The Lord rewarded their courage,                     because they felt honored. »                             The  spiritual  participation  of  the  institution  for  the  grand  Eucharistic                     procession of Lourdes at the end of the international Eucharistic congress on July                     26,  1914,  was  an  original  thought  of  the  Father.  Through  a  circular  letter,  he                     remembers  the  sick  people  in  line  at  the  passing  of  the  Blessed  Sacrament,                     crying:                             « O Lord Jesus in the Sacrament, have mercy on us, please heal us,                     heal  us!  »  Probably,  sudden  healings  may  happen  during  the  procession  as  it                     happened in the past... Well, we all are sick in the soul more than in the body; we                     have  to  long  for  healing  spiritual  more  than  bodily  sickness.  For  that  reason,                     several persons will place themselves on the right and the left side of the places                     through which the Holy Sacrament will pass in procession in our houses.                             One will represent the  Pious Institute of Jesus' Heart's interests,  two                     will represent the orphanages for boys and girls, two other persons","will represent the religious communities, another one will represent the poor,                     and another will represent the absent people who are willing to be represented.                     All of them will wear a badge indicating the people represented, such as: Pious                     Institution,  Orphanages,  etc.  Together  with  the  crowd  they  will  cry:  «  Lord                     Jesus in the Sacrament, have mercy on us, please heal us, heal us! » These                     invocations will be spoken now and then with raised hands, at aloud, plaintive                     voice during the procession, beginning from the time it starts. The two rows of                     the  representatives  will  face  each  other  so  that  the  Holy  Sacrament  will  pass                     through, without interference from the general public.                             If the procession is public, nothing hinders this devout, effective practice                     from  being  done.  Done  with  faith,  humility  and  love,  it  will  obtain  spiritual                     healing from Jesus in the Sacrament! (S.C. Vol. 5, page 26).                             An  annual  homage  was  given  to  Jesus  in  the  Sacrament  by  the  sacred                     garbage sweepers. They are the padre's orphans who cleaned the streets for the                     Corpus Christi procession and tossed flowers before the Holy Sacrament. At the                     beginning of the institution, children were lacking shoes... but after the Father                     conceived the sacred garbage sweepers, shoes never failed. He could not suffer                     seeing Jesus passing in triumph through the dirty streets of the city because of the                     coming and going of calashes, carriages, and vehicles of any sort - cars were still       272                     to be invented. The most pious and devout orphans were appointed to this office                     as a reward. Provided with brooms, bags, and little shovels, they preceded the                     grand  procession,  preparing  the  way  for  the  Lord  by  cleaning  the  streets  and                     tossing flowers. The days previous to the procession, the orphans called upon the                     gardens and the villas surrounding the city to pick up the flowers which were                     gathered in the institute.                             Perhaps  in  1925,  a  few  rascals  decided  to  impede  the  sacred  garbage                     sweepers from doing their office. The orphans, however, deemed that it was the                     time to show their courage; after giving the eye, three or four of them lifted up                     brooms  and  shovels,  threatening  the  invaders...  who  sneaked  off,  leaving  the                     orphans holding their ground.                             The day after, the Father went to Avignone Quarter, gathered the boys in                     the yard to know personally the brave, and complimented them:","- Bravo! Well done!... Ready to do everything for our Lord ? - Yes, Father, ready                     to everything...                     - Even to death for him ?...                     - Yes, Father, with his divine help...                     - Bravo, blessed, blessed boys...- He lifted up his hand to bless ...and went away,                     his eyes wet with tears!                             After  the  1908  earthquake,  the  Father  was  glad  to  continue  a  singular                     Eucharistic tradition of Messing.                             In  the  last  three  days  of  the  holy  week,  when  the  cathedral  closed  the                     adoration of forty hours, Saint Joakim's parish exposed the Blessed Sacrament                     and covered it with a transparent veil, beginning at noon of Wednesday up to                     about 11:00 a.m. of Saturday. They had the reposition of the Sacrament every                     night  and  the  exposition  every  morning.  Such  a  practice  dated  back  to  a  few                     centuries, because Saint Joakim's church was built in 1645. The historian Caio                     Dominic Gallo from Messing touches upon this extraordinary exposition, whose                     sister practice - says he - is held in Trieste.                             When Saint Joakim's church was destroyed by the earthquake, this pious                     practice  was  dying  out.  But  a  fervent  layman  by  the  name  of  Mastro  Pasqua                     intervened, and he himself testifies: « I, a barber, went to the late Msgr. D'Arrigo      273                     and said my wish to continue such a devotion. We agreed to contact Canon Di                     Francia, so I did.                             He accepted the proposal with joy, chose a better room than the usual one,                     and  organized  the  adoration  of  40  hours  to  a  great  consolation  of  the  citizens                     survivors.»  Another  witness  recalls  the  Servant  of  God's  participation  in  this                     triduo: « I remember very well the triduo from holy Thursday to holy Saturday                     when  he  read  the  most  beautiful  prayer  on  Jesus'  Passion  before  the  Blessed                     Sacrament exposed in the monstrance, covered by a transparent veil, even in the                     night. »                             Writing to the communities, the Father aimed at renewing their faith and                     fervor by recalling the presence of Jesus in the Sacrament...                             I express my satisfaction to you, because your beloved has come again to dwell                     with you in the holy tabernacle, whence he looks at and keeps you lovingly. Blessed                     daughters, keep him a good company, thinking of the supreme goodness and holding                     yourselves fortunate to have such a treasure so near! « Wherever the body is, there will                     the eagles gather >> (Lk. 17, 37). Flying over the earthly things, may you be as eagles                     and doves gathering with your hearts and affection around the most holy body, which is                     our food! (S.C. Vol. 5, page 7).","Consider that you have the most adorable lover of souls, Jesus! He is with you,                     loves you, wants you to belong totally to him; keep him holy company together                     with his most holy mother and Saint Joseph ! (Vol. 38, page 57).                             He exhorts the mother superior of the Sacred Side in Potenza: « Urge the                     sisters to keep Jesus in the sacrament good company; he is with them, whereas he                     is not at Spinazzola, nor at Marsico ! Therefore, the sisters of Potenza should win                     the  others  in  humility,  obedience,  charity,  spirit  of  prayer  and  sacrifice  »                     (S.C..-Vol. 8, page 123).                             As  to  him,  he  was  very  careful  to  practice  everything  he  exhorted  the                     others to do.                             After  reading  that  Saint  Veronica  couldn't  get  to  sleep,  because  she                     thought of receiving Jesus in the Sacrament the following morning, he prays to                     her:                             «  Ah,  see  to  it  that  I  be  so  enamored  of  the  supreme  goodness  in  the                     sacrament,  so  thirsty  for  receiving  him  and  staying  in  his  presence  as  to  be                     unable to get asleep. May I only think of him, only feed spiritual things, nothing                     tasting and seeking but you, my enjoyment, my food, my delight, my all, Jesus in          274                     the Sacrament » (Vol. 6, page 131).                        9.  Most holy Communion                               Let us touch upon holy Communion. In the early years of Mary Hannibal,                     in Messina a Jansenistic mentality prohibited children under 12 to 14 years of                     age from receiving first Communion. The Father had the fortune to receive it at                     the age of seven to eight in the boarding-school, owing to the Cistercian Fathers'                     spirit and to the zealous Father Ascanio Foty, who prepared him. The child often                     asked the good father: « What do I have to tell Jesus, when he comes into my                     soul ? What do I have to ask him ? » Jesus himself taught him","what  to  ask,  because  he  excited  in  his  soul  a  strong  desire  to  receive                     Communion every day; but due to the above conditions, he was permitted to                     receive it only on Sunday up to the age of seventeen, a few months before he                     took the cassock. Later, he will endeavor to recover the Communions he lost                     in his childhood by praying as many spiritual communions. He writes:                            « To make up for the sacramental Communions I have lost at the age                     from  seven  to  seventeen,  I  have  to  pray  2,355  spiritual  communions,  about                     three a day for three years and a half, with God's blessing. Messina, June 7,                     1907, Friday, feast of the Heart of Jesus » (S.C. Vol. 10, page 69).                            Some evidences read: « He complained to himself because at the time                     of his childhood receiving holy Communion at a tender age was prohibited.                     And he excited the little children to desire first Communion. » We cannot help                     remarking a « dear coincidence, » as the padre called it, between the title of                     the Eucharist (Tender and Sweet Lover of Little Children)  and the Quam                     singulari decree of Pope Pius X on August 8 of the same year, through which                     he called children to the Eucharistic table. The padre had written in the July                     first hymn:                      Come, dear children,                     He prepared the mystical table for you.                     Please do not say « you are too little » to them,                                         275                     They may understand the Host through.                     Please say: he is ours: we are his beloved,                     By him we are loved.                      Please say: to understand the great call                     Human wisdom is foolishness,                     Even space is too small, But our faith is not littleness !                     - I am speaking to the simple - this is the regimen                     - Of the sweet lover of little children.                     (Vol. 46, page 193).                            In the verses by the Father we read ahead of time the reasons that the                     Pope brought into the decree, which is about to give us the saints even among                     children - it's the Pope's expression. Shortly after, Cardinal Gennari published                     a commentary on the decree, and the Father reviewed it in God and Neighbor                     (S.C. Vol. 1, page 140).                            Preparing  children  to  receive  first  Communion  was  dearest  to  the                     Father, and he applied himself to it until he was able to do so. How much he                     praised Pius  X for  having  lowered  the  age  for  Communion  so  that  children                     might receive it. « At the age of six or seven years we orphans received first                     Communion, and","when the Father was available he himself prepared us, suggesting frequent,                     and even daily Communion. »                      In the rules, the Father reminds the sisters that one of their best tasks is                     preparing the little girls for first Communion in such a way that the memory                     of that day be unforgettable; he treats the topic in detail, as it has been                     published in the Rogationist Anthology (Ch. 22, note no. (5), page 453).                     While governing the communities, the padre learned that several sisters and                     Rogationists  did  not  remember  the  day  of  their  first  Communion;  such                     forgetfulness is usual for those who received their first Communion without                     proper  preparation.  This  fact  grieved  our  founder,  who  felt  that  everyone                     should have a fond memory of this great benefit in order to thank the Lord                     throughout their lives. His love of Jesus, which was restless like fire, made                     him find a means for a new practice: First Communion Renewal.                             On a set date, a person would pretend to receive his first Communion                     after preparing himself with those acts of love that he would have made in his                     early years. For this end, the padre wrote many loving colloquies... Proper                     songs accompanied prayer » (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 300).                                                                                                               276                            A sister reports: « Several sisters did not remember the day of their first                     Communion; the Father gave them a white veil along with candles, celebrated                     the mass making a special speech, and donated a religious picture as                     memento, as though that day were the real day of their first Communion. »                             He was an apostle of daily Communion.                             He  promoted  daily  Communion  in  his  institutes  since  their  origin,                     giving detailed prescriptions about preparation and thanksgiving. His children                     followed  easily  the  Father's  advice,  and  when  people  talked  about  general                     Communion,  he  said:  «  By  God's  grace,  general  Communion  is  practiced                     every day in our institutes ! » He spread the decree by Pius X Sacra Tridentina                     Synodus (Dec. 20, 1905).                             A former female orphan wrote to the Father from America, saying that                     she was receiving holy Communion every week. The Father answered:                     Why not every day ? I am mailing to you the book having the decree along                     with the explanation. Profit by it » (Vol. 42, page","65). He erected the « Priestly Eucharistic League » in our church in Messina,                     and  joined  it  to  the  main  one  in  Saint  Claude's  church  (Rome)  in  order  to                     spread frequent and daily Communion among people.                            When the Servant of God paid a visit to Msgr. Loiacono, « those who                     took  more  advantage  of  his  teaching  were  the  seminarians,  who  had  the                     chance to meet him because the seminary was next to the bishop's palace and                     had internal communications. At the Father's question whether they received                     holy Communion, the seminarians answered that they did so more than once a                     week. And the Father: « How many times a week do you eat ? » The obvious                     answer was: « Every day. » Then, the Servant of God concluded: « As you                     need to feed on material food every day, so you need holy Communion every                     day to feed your souls. »                            Talking about the spirit of the institute, the Father gets the point in the                     following perspective: « We call the Daughters of Divine Zeal's full attention                     on this chief point, on which their sanctification, their salvation, the progress                     and the steadiness of their institution depend » (Vol. 1, page 1).                            « He wants the soul to be desirous and thirsty for Jesus while receiving                     Communion.  The  natural  affections,  the  sentiments  of  the  heart,  human                     faculties  and  sensitiveness,  everything  should  be  transformed  into  spiritual                     understanding, into hunger and thirst for Jesus » (Ibid. page 3).                            His  insistence  on  the  preparation  and  thanksgiving  for  holy                277                     Communion is continuous and considerate.                            «  Remote  preparation  consists  in  a  religious  irreproachable  life.  You                     will  direct  the  daily  acts  of  virtue,  patience,  work,  mortification,  prayer,                     spiritual reading, silence, and everything toward the accomplishment of this                     goal » (Ibid. page 4).                            One  of  the  sisters'  nightly  prayers  regards  holy  Communion  on  the                     following day. The soul should go to sleep thinking of the next  Communion                     so that awaking in the night she may pour out fervent ejaculatory prayers to                     Jesus, who is waiting for her in the tabernacle.                            The immediate preparation begins with the morning meditation on the                     Passion,  as  «  the  very  happy  but  indispensable  condition  to  receive  holy                     Communion with compunction, fervor, and love, as well as to take advantage                     of it » (Ibid. page 28).                            Before  the  mass,  the  Father  used  to  exhort  the  community  briefly,                     always touching on two topics: the first was the divine  sacrifice; the second,                     holy Communion. With grave voice and","significant  gesture  of  the  right  hand  he  said:  «  Now,  let  us  touch  upon  the                     persons who are going to receive holy Communion. This is the point... » And                     he continued exhorting them to be fervent  in receiving it. He did not suffer                     giving Communion before the mass, as the female communities did in those                     times;  it  should  be  done  at  proper  time,  during  the  mass.  After  the  conse-                     cration no other prayer was admitted in common, but the preparation for holy                     Communion, and some minutes of silence.                            After  receiving  the  Lord,  people  had  to  begin  not  a  fleeting,  but  a                     combination of thanksgivings lasting all day long up to the next Communion                     (he  describes  them  in  details  .~.  (Vol.  1,  page  8).  He  said  that  each                     Communion should be a thanksgiving for the last one and a preparation for                     the  next  so  that  each  Communion  be  more  fervent  and  beneficial  than  the                     previous one.                            The  Father  thought  that  the  existence  of  the  institution  depended  on                     Communion well received. We quote:                             In the most holy name of Jesus I urge the present and future Daughters                     of Divine Zeal to consider that the improvement in the Lord of their humble                     institute  along  with  its  aims  depends  on  receiving  frequently  Eucharistic                     Communion  with  the  dispositions,  preparations,  and  thanksgivings  we  have                     expounded above.                                                                          278                            The  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  must  be  convinced  that  union  of  love                     with  Jesus  in  the  Communion  gives  life,  existence,  growth,  fecundity,  and                     firmness to a religious institute. Mutual union with Jesus founds the institute                     on a firm rock, which hellish powers are unable to throw down nor to impair                     its beneficial results in the holy Church...                            On  the  contrary,  when  a  community  slackens  the  remote  and  the                     immediate  preparation  for  frequent  Holy  Communion  as  well  as  adequate                     thanksgiving,  quite  the  reverse  will  happen.  Jesus  is  displeased  by  the                     indifference of the consecrated people who receive him every day while their                     hearts are attached to their own ego, while they are full of selfishness, perhaps                     dirty  with  serious  faults,  envy,  and  grudges.  In  such  a  case  which  are  the                     consequences we have to face ? God withdraws his mercies and reduces his                     grace...                            I heartily recommend that the mother superiors be most watchful, that                     the  sisters  receive  Holy  Communion  with  the  dispositions,  devotion,  and                     recollection  we  have  described  above,  and  make  the  thanksgivings  as  well                     (Vol. 1, page 10).                            The Father was most precise even in the least details of this topic, such                     as in teaching how people ought to receive the","Eucharist, at what height the plate should be placed, how to open the mouth, how                     to put the tongue out, etc. He often made people have such rehearsals under his                     guidance. Says a sister: « His teaching notwithstanding, one day I was holding                     the plate far below my throat while receiving Communion; the Father grasped the                     plate and put it at the right place.                      While  going  to  receive  Communion,  they  should  hasten  as  to  show  their                     eagerness for meeting Jesus. A sister remarks: « A few of us sometimes smiled                     when the Father denied us Communion during the mass for not having hastened                     to  the  Communion  rail;  soon  after,  however,  we  altogether  begged  pardon,                     insisting to reopen the tabernacle and give us Communion. When he denied it,                     we  ran  after  him  who  was  almost  indignant  with  us.  We  knocked  at  his  door                     begging pardon again. One time, he  yielded to our demands at 11:00 a.m.; he                     behaved so because he thought we did not desire Jesus, and charged us with that.                     »  It  could  be  a  pious  industry  to  excite  hunger  for  Jesus,  or  a  measure  of                     prudence.  In  fact,  we  read  another  report:  «  He  exhorted  us  to  go  to  the                     Communion rail all together to show that we were anxious to receive the food of                     our souls; but someone guessing said that he acted so to make the persons who                     did not receive Communion remain unnoticed.»                                                                                                                279                      10. Eucharistic fragments                                The Father had already planned to write a booklet about the Eucharistic                     fragments when he sent a notice to his communities saying to them to post it in                     the  sacristies.  Through  this  notice  he  exhorted  the  priests  to  take  care  of  the                     Eucharistic fragments.                            Father Vincenzo Iuvara, a chaplain of the Daughters of Divine Zeal at the                     Holy Spirit's church, reacted to the notice as it were a warning to him.                            Not at all. The Father wrote the notice because Eucharistic fragments can                     be  dispersed  by  lack  of  proper  care.  It  is  a  general  principle,  and  calling  the                     attention of the priests on this point offends no one. Was it an exaggeration of the                     Father ? We cannot deny that the Servants of God have a way of thinking of","their own. When a consecrated host falls to the ground, it is picked up and placed                     in the pyx. That's it. But the pastor of Ars considered the risk of trampling on it...                     «  One  day  he  cried  while  talking  about  the  fragments  which  can  fall  to  the                     ground, running the risk of being trampled on, and said: « Therefore, the good                     God is trampled on ! Oh, how much painful it is ! It is terrible, we cannot think                     of ! » (Fourray, Il Curato d Ars Autentico, page 264, note 137). Such a mishap                     also happened to the Father: « He picked up the host and placed a bell on that                     place. When the service was over, he said to us that he was unworthy of holding                     the Lord in his hands, and begged pardon to Jesus in public. » There is more,                     something heroic. Sister Gertrude reports that an orphan girl of seven or eight                     years  vomited  after  receiving  Communion.  When  the  Father  was  alone,  he                     gulped it down, thinking there was still the real presence. Another sister reports                     that it happened twice on different occasions.                            The liturgy provides the proper way in dealing with such a case. The                     Father taught us not to fill up the pyx, lest the hosts might fall down while lifting                     up the cover.                            The  Father  began  writing  the  booklet  of  the  Eucharistic  fragments  on                     November  26,  1926,  giving  it  the  form  of  a  circular  letter  to  the  bishops,                     exposing  several  cases  in  which  he  had  witnessed  evident  infringements  and                     profanations of the sacred fragments, and suggesting the remedies. The first one                     was:  the  good  confection  of  the  hosts.  But  the  manuscript  ends  at  this  point   280                     without  the  complete  description  of  the  first  remedy.  The  Father  fell  sick  in                     January 1927, and did not recover (S.C. Vol. 9, pages 2362).                        11. Holy mass                                First of all, the Father was very careful of the holy sacrifice's matter. He                     wrote: « The superiors cannot confide in the hosts they buy, unless they know                     where  the  hosts  come  from  »  (Vol.  1,  page  42).  When  he  opened  his  mill  in                     Messina, he cheered up because the ecclesiastical authority obligated","the priests to buy the hosts from him or from those who used his flour (Vol.                     45, page 452). Raging the first world war, in 1916 he inaugurated a mill next                     to  our  orphanage  at  San  Pier  Niceto,  in  the  presence  of  the  authorities  and                     numerous guests. Coming close to the end of his speech, he reminded them                     that wheat is the remote matter of the Eucharist, and continued:                            From  this  point  of  view,  the  installation  of  our  mill  is  of  greatest                     importance for  it  provides  pure flour for  the  hosts  that  perpetuate  our  Lord                     Jesus  Christ's  sacramental  life  on  earth...  Ladies  and  gentlemen,  I  let  you                     know that with this mill we aim at our best service to the Eucharist. I wish                     that  this  wheel  and  stones  continue  to  rotate  by  day  and  by  night  to  form                     purest flour to form the  hosts of which thousands and thousands of souls in                     San Pier Niceto, in the province, and in Sicily are fed ! Then the abundance of                     divine providence will fill the earth and the punishment of the Lord will be                     averted ! (Vol. 45, page 520).                            As soon as he knew that a congregation was making the hosts with the                     flour sold in the common market, he wrote to the superior general: « They are                     making  the  hosts  for  the  mass  with  the  flour  sold  in  the  market  !  Please                     prepare three boxes of pure flour of wheat for hosts, and send them by parcel                     post to the three houses » (Vol. 35, page 122).                            He worried for the wine of the mass as for the flour, hoping to have his                     own production to supply his communities (Vol. 1, page 46). But in Messing                281                     the  wine  for  the  mass  was  supplied  by  the  good  families  Ciccolo  and                     Antonuccio, and the Father was more confident.                            On one occasion, perhaps in a town of Calabria, when the Father was                     about to say mass, the sacristan sent for some wine from an inn. The Father                     refused to say mass; but, from then on, he always brought hosts and wine with                     him when going to say mass to unknown churches. He had written:                             Because I am unworthy and want to be always aware of my unworth-                     iness  of  ascending  to  the  altar,  I  mean  to spend  all  my  life  in  a  continuous                     preparation and thanksgiving for the celebration of the tremendous sacrifice                     and for the holy Eucharistic Communion. To prepare myself, before the mass                     I  will  kneel  and  pray  for  some  minutes  according  to  our  constitutions,                     avoiding  any  talk  or  distraction.  While  celebrating,  I  will  pace  the                     pronunciation of the words... To avoid making mistakes or leaving out some                     part or changing things with each other, I will prepare everything before the                     celebration, following the ordo... Mindful of the well-proceeding of the mass,                     I will admonish the altar boy, even severely if it is necessary, when he rushes                     the words or is distracted.","After the celebration I will make a thanksgiving of at least twenty minutes                     in  the  church  or  in  the  sacristy;  sometimes,  however,  I  will  be  available  for                     charity or the works of ministry (Vol. 44, page 127).                             We report a few evidences on how he kept his resolves.                            «  He  said  mass  every  day;  while  traveling  he  endeavored  to  say  mass,                     even changing trains, if it was necessary. He wrote the number of the masses he                     was unable to say because of sickness. He did so in order to make up for them by                     saying more than one mass a day when it was necessary. Our priests were few in                     those times. »                            « He said mass every day, his health permitting... Only in the last times he                     succeeded  to  refrain  from  tears  while  saying  mass,  above  all  because  people                     around looked at him  on purpose.  For the same reason he prohibited the altar                     boys to be too near him, especially at the consecration time (Then the altar was                     turned  toward  the  wall).  His  thanksgiving  for  the  mass  was  long  and  deeply                     touching. »                            To follow his preaching carefully and to have the joy of attending a saint's                     mass,  Father  Sibilia  asked  to  attend  the  padre's  mass  from  the  side  sacristy                     instead of from inside the church (Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di  Francia,  page                     277).                                                                                                               282                            The  cathedral's  Archdeacon  Francis  Della  Queva  testifies:  «  Usually  he                     celebrated in the cathedral, and he himself brought the host and the wine for the                     mass.  During  the  preparation  and  while  dressing  the  vestments,  a  somewhat                     seraphic ardor transpired from him. Because he happened to say mass at noon, I                     was unable to assist him, but the Sacristan Ruppi Leonard related that the Father                     lengthened the mass, and compensated him for the service. »                            Before saying mass, he emptied his pockets to be free from earthly things,                     holding glasses and handkerchief. As to silence before mass, a Daughter of the                     Sacred  Side  says  that  one  morning  she  told  the  Father  something,  but  he                     answered: « For this matter a sign was enough. »                            Brother Louis Mary Barbanti reports:                             The  Father  said  mass  with  great  fervor,  never  speaking  during  the                     celebration, nor he allowed other persons to speak. He seemed to be in rapture... I                     remember that one day before the December 28, 1908","earthquake  I  was  saying  the  prayer  of  the  community  during  the  mass                     celebrated by the Father. At the time of lavabo he sent the altar boy for me. I                     thought  it  funny,  because  the  Father  was  never  disturbed  from  the  outside                     during the mass.                            He told me: « At the door there are a few persons asking of me: tell                     them to wait until the end of the mass. » As a matter of fact, there were people                     traveling  from  Rome  to  Catania,  vivaciously  speaking  with  the  doorkeeper,                     who was telling them that only at about 8:30 - 9:00 the Father could receive                     them.  The  chapel  was  far  from  the  doorkeeper,  so  the  voices  could  not  be                     heard from the inside of the chapel; but I thought of it later.                             I often saw him shedding tears during the mass; perhaps for this reason                     he told me to stay a little far from the altar: he disliked being observed. When                     I was a waiter for some time, I realized that his breakfast got cold because of                     his prolonged thanksgiving after mass.                            His mass was longer than the other priests'; but the words he addressed                     to us at the main parts of the mass made it delightful.                            The following evidence is more exhaustive:                             When the Father said mass for us (it was ordinary in the early times),                     he  addressed  to  us  a  little  speech  as  preparation  for  Communion,  also          283                     explaining  the  intention  of  the  sacrifice.  On  the  holydays,  he  explained  the                     intentions of the mass at the beginning of the celebration, had the homily after                     the  gospel,  and  a  colloquy  before  Communion  to  prepare  us  to  receiving                     Jesus. Sometimes, on holydays, his mass became too long, and we got tired;                     his words, however, especially at the gospel, were always new and welcomed.                     Later, when he realized that his mass was too long, he confessed that old age                     was necessary to understand that people get tired. But, he alone had to give                     Communion to about a hundred people.                             While traveling, he stopped to say mass, fasting even up to 1:00 p.m.                     When a second mass was necessary, he reserved the right to say it, declaring                     that he was ready to receive Communion endless times a day. He wondered                     why the Church commanded to receive it at least once a year.                            At  Ariano  Irpino,  «  he  said  mass  and  preached  in  the  cathedral,  the                     people holding him as a saint. » This evidence by Msgr. Loiacono is matched                     by Father Angel Rizzi, then a seminarian and an altar boy in the cathedral on                     that  occasion.  «  The  Servant  of  God  celebrated  with  so  much  piety  and                     recollection. He","warned us mildly because we rushed our answers at the introit. »                            Thomas  Pasqua,  the  sacristan  at  Saint  Dionisio's,  testifies:  «  More  than                     once I served as an altar man to his mass; he greatly edified everyone, seeming to                     me like a priest in rapture. After mass, he remained kneeling and deeply bowed                     before the Sacrament for his long thanksgiving. One day, he retired to the choir                     for thanksgiving. Closed the church, he remained over there, and went out at the                     coming of the parish priest. »                        12. The Value of holy mass                                The Father's devotion and recollection was the outcome of his faith in the                     value of holy mass. Usually, he did not accept any offering for the mass « not to                     alienate his daily intentions of    the sacrifice's special      fruit  »  (Adhesions                     1919) from his most holy aims, such as: the glory of God, the triumph of the                     Church, the progress of the institution, etc. « Having his own intentions, he rarely                     celebrated according to others' intention, but handed the offerings to our priests.                     »                                                                                         284                            In  a  nightly  prayer  dating  back  to  the  early  years  of  his  priesthood,  he                     remembers the masses which are said during the night:                             As  thanksgiving  for  the  graces  you  have  granted  me  during  this  day,                     above all for the mass you let me say this morning, for the help, providence, and                     preservation from so many evils; in expiation of my weakness and sins and for                     the patience with which you have tolerated and benefited me, I offer your merits                     and  your  divine  Heart  along  with  the  Immaculate  Heart  of  your  most  holy                     mother, the merits of the angels and the saints. I also intend to present the divine                     masses which are going to be celebrated this night all over the world along with                     the masses which have been celebrated and will be said... I intend to present this                     offer at any moment of this night, at every beat of my heart, at every breath... for                     the souls in purgatory, for the conversion of sinners, for the salvation of all souls,                     for the interests of your divine Heart, for all people and for everything (Vol. 6,                     page 104).","When in need, he appealed to the mass; triduo, septenary, novena of                     masses. In extraordinary cases, he said 33 uninterrupted masses to honor the                     years of our Lord. In his old age he increased the number to 34, considering                     the life of our Lord since the moment of his conception.                            « He made the mass esteemed in his community, teaching that through                     the offering of the mass we obtain everything, that the mass is all, because                     heavens open, pouring down graces at the immolation of the divine victim »                     (Adhesions 1919).                     He wrote:                             To win spiritual and temporal graces for God's glory, for the good of                     the  holy  Church,  the  whole  world,  and  their  own  sanctification  the  sisters                     will attend mass with faith and hope.                            Through their faith, the sisters will see during the celebration of the                     holy  mass  immense  rivers  of  graces  and  blessings  coming  out  of  it  and                     expanding all over the Church and the world...During the celebration of the                     holy mass Jesus pays to the most holy Trinity the homage of all creatures,                     adores  the  divine  attributes  on  our  behalf,  and  offers  himself  to  the  most                     holy Trinity as victim of infinite satisfaction for the graces the Father, the                     Son,  and  the  Holy  Spirit  grant;  being  the  powerful  mediator,  he  implores                     graces and mercies... Special attention must be paid to the persons who offer             285                     the mass. These people are: our Lord, the celebrant priest, and the faithful                     attending  the  mass  with  faith  and  love.  The  sacred  authors  say  that  those                     who do not receive grace during the mass owing to negligence, lack of faith                     or devotion will never receive any (Vol. 1, page 37).                             The Father wrote some prayers for the intentions of the mass, which                     were  said  every  day,  and  many  others  for  special  occasions  and                     circumstances, which are gathered in his writings.                            How did the communities attend mass ? In the times previous to the                     Vatican  Council,  people  attended  mass  saying  prayers.  Leaving  out  the                     historical  question  about  this  topic,  we  recall  that  the  Father  was  leading                     with children, and children are usually unable to pray, but by word of mouth.                     That  was  the  practice  of  the  saints,  such  as  Saint  Joseph  Cottolengo,  who                     filled  up  the  community's  mass  with  prayer;  furthermore,  the  community                     also attended a second one, called the « 55 Our Father Mass » in which the                     community said 55 Our Fathers for specific intentions. Saint Giovanni Bosco                     made children say prayers during the mass, according to the liturgical laws                     of those times. Leo XIII went on in exhorting the faithful to say the rosary                     during the mass (Supremi Apostolatus, September 1, 1883; Superiore Anno,","August 13, 1884).                             Pius XII (November 20, 1947) said in the Mediator Dei that not everyone                     is able to rightly understand the sacred rites, nor is everyone having the same                     genius,  character,  and  disposition;  therefore,  they  might  attend  the  mass  by  «                     piously meditating on Jesus Christ's mysteries, or performing practices of piety,                     or saying prayers. » These words were inserted in the instruction of the Sacred                     Congregation of Rites (no. 29 on September 3, 1958, shortly before the Second                     Vatican Council.                             The Father allowed the communities to say prayers, novenas, etc., during                     the mass up to the consecration. The remnant time was reserved for preparation                     for holy Communion. I report an episode. One Sunday, the reader began saying                     the prayer to be liberated from diving punishments along with the « seven Glory                     bes  »  with  raised  hands.  The  prayer  ended  at  the  Communion.  The  Father                     extemporized  a  colloquy,  but  after  the  mass  said:  Blessed  children,  don't  you                     know that the first condition to be liberated from divine punishments is receiving                     the most holy Communion with good preparation ? »                                                                                                                 286                     13. The Eucharistic Heart of Jesus                                The devotion to the Sacred Heart is strictly connected with the most holy                     Eucharist, because the Sacred Heart shows Jesus' love for humankind, and the                     Eucharist is the highest manifestation of Jesus' love for us. Hence the devotion to                     the Eucharistic Heart  of Jesus came forth.  This devotion was born in the past                     century  to  honor  Jesus'  love  for  having  given  the  most  holy  Eucharist.  The                     promoters were Saint Julian Eymard, Saint John Bosco, Msgr. De Segur... At the                     end of the past century this devotion had already spread to the nations through                     many brotherhoods, and the one of Rome officiated by the Redemptorist Fathers                     was erected as archbrotherhood by Leo XIII in 1903.","The Father felt drawn to this devotion which joins the Sacred Heart with                     the  Eucharist,  and  he  proclaimed  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus  absolute,                     immediate, and effective superior of the Rogationists in Oria, on July first 1913,                     after  fervent  preparation  of  the  communities  through  a  triduo  of  prayers  and                     instructions (S.C. Vol. 9, pages 26 and 34). Then he prescribed the community to                     say  this  Latin  ejaculatory  prayer  at  the  start  of  any  act  in  common:  «                     Sacratissimun Cor Eucharisticum Domini Nostri Jesu Christi tanquam preceptor                     noster  in  medio  nostrum  praesens,  una  cum  Superiorissa  nostra  Immaculata                     Virgine Maria, nos dirigat, regat et gubernet. Amen. »                             In that year, the Redemptorist Father Alphonsus De Feo presented a report                     on  the  Eucharistic  Heart  of  Jesus  to  the  international  Eucharistic  congress  of                     Malta.                             The Father read that report and congratulated De Feo, asking him for a                     singular grace:                             My beloved father, kneeling I ask you for the following grace: everything                     you do and think of for the glory of the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, our supreme                     goodness, do so joining me to you in spirit, not as a companion but as your boy                     who follows your steps. As your boy, I intend to think of and work with you in            287                     everything you think of and work for the love and honor of the Eucharistic Heart                     of Jesus. Blessed be the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus! (S.C. Vol. 5, page 289).                             But  one  evening,  about  a  year  later  in  Oria,  the  Father  ordered  the                     community not to say Eucharistic Heart, but simply Heart of Jesus. What had                     happened ? What usually happens at the rising of new devotions. Persons zealous                     to excess misunderstood, exaggerated, and made mistakes about the meaning, the                     object, and the aim of the devotion to the Eucharistic Heart; therefore, the Holy                     See condemned the mistakes with a decree on July 15, 1914. People said that the                     devotion was condemned, but the Holy See intervened again on April 3, 1915, to                     state more exactly that the devotion to the Eucharistic Heart, well understood,                     was  not  prohibited,  it  was  rather  positively  recognized.  The  Father  greatly                     delighted  in  it,  especially  when  Benedict  XV  published  the  mass  and  the                     canonical hours of the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus, on November 9, 1921.                             This devotion has been confirmed by Pius XII's Haurietis aquas (May 15,                     1956).  It  is  recommended,  because  «  people  cannot  easily  understand  the                     strength of the love which urged the Savior to become our spiritual nourishment                     without cultivating a special devotion to the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus » (no. 71).","Notes                         (1) To greatly excite the tender hearts to long for the coming of Jesus in the Sacrament,                     the tabernacle remained open and people looked at it desirously (Vol. 1, page 96).

(3) After the coming of Jesus in the Sacrament, the Father wrote a long prayer « to the                     Emmanuel dwelling in our chapel in the night » (Vol. 6, page 33), whence « the protest                     for the night » was derived.

One cannot be                           a follower of Christ without being                           a follower of Mary                                 After Jesus, Mary. As people grew feeble in the devotion to the Sacred                     Heart in the last  years, so they did in the devotion to the Madonna,  under the                     pretext of making Jesus stand out as mediator between us and God.                            This  pretext,  however,  is  an  old  heresy.  In  his  times,  speaking  of  the                     scrupulous devout who said, “Talk to us of those who are lovers of Jesus. We                     have to appeal to Jesus only, because he is the only mediator. We have to speak                     of  Jesus  from  the  pulpit,”  Saint  Louis  of  Monfort  points  out  that  they  often                     mention the name of Jesus without taking their hats off, and adds, “They do not                     realize that the devil is concealed under the pretext of a greater good. As a matter                     of fact, the best way to honor Jesus Christ is honoring his mother” (Treatise of                     the True Devotion, no. 94). The Father says, “Whoever does not love Jesus, does                     not love Mary. The more we love Mary, the more we love Jesus” (S.C. Vol. 10,              290                     page 184). “Mary's intercession is morally necessary for our eternal salvation”                     (Vol. 22, page 84). “Without being devout to Mary, we cannot be really devout                     and virtuous, nor can we achieve eternal salvation” (S.C. Vol. 6, page 231).                             The Church's teaching is the following. Saint Pius X states: “Unfortunate                     and unhappy are those who disregard Mary under the pretext of honoring Jesus.                     They ignore that we can only find Jesus through Mary,  his  mother”  (Ad diem                     illum, February 2, 1904).                             Pius XII: “The worship toward the Mother of God is an essential part of                     Christian life” (October 12, 1947). “Marian devotion will lead you to understand                     Christ better and to be more intensely united with his mysteries. You will receive                     Jesus from","the hands of Mary, who will teach you how to love and imitate him” (September                     29, 1957).                             The Second Vatican  Council: “Mary's function as  mother of men in no                     ways obscures or diminishes this unique mediation of Christ, but rather shows its                     power”  (L.G.  60).  Paul  VI:  “Devotion  to  the  Madonna  becomes  necessary  to                     each faithful » (January 1, 1967). When he spoke in Sardinia about the Madonna                     of Bonaria, he stated more exactly the role of Mary in the spiritual life by saying,                     “One cannot be a follower of Christ without being a follower of Mary” (April 24,                     1970). Such a statement drives away the false devotee's scruples condemned by                     Monfort.                             The  saints  are  perfect  Christians,  consequently  they  must  be  perfect                     followers of Mary! For this reason, in the process of beatification of a Servant of                     God,  the  nature  and  the  degree  of  his  Marian  devotion  are  examined.  After                     becoming a Christian, the Jew Blessed Francis M. Paul Libermann (1802 1852)                     wrote, “As soon as the baptismal water touched my Jewish head, I began loving                     Mary, whom I hated before” (Robaldo, Esercizi mariani, page 159).                             It is not a surprise. The Father says,                                                                                                               291                            “The tender, deep, sweet, gentle love toward the most holy Mary, Mother                     of God, forms the saints, is strictly joined with the love for God, and is necessary                     to obtain  any grace. The predestinated love  Immaculate Mary”  (Vol. 45, page                     160).  “Please  consider  Mary's  greatness,  following  the  example  of  the  saints,                     who achieved holiness by being particularly devout to the Mother of God. Saint                     Louis Monfort wrote that devotion to the most holy Mary is a secret of holiness”                     (S.C. Vol. 3, page 183).                            Talking  to  the  seminarians,  the  Father  exclaimed,  “If  I  knew  the  cleric                     who is the most fervent lover of the most holy Mother of God, I would embrace                     him, congratulating him. He will become a saint, surely a zealous minister of the                     Lord, an apostle of faith and charity, a savior of souls!”(Ibid.)                            What fits of enthusiasm for the Madonna we find in the Father's writing!                            “Mary!  Your  name  is  the  sweetest  music  appeasing  the  storms  in  the                     hearts;  it  is  a  very  gentle  balm,  sweetening  the  spirit  overwhelmed  by  grief”                     (Ibid.  page  60).  “It  is  sweet  and  gentle  to  speak  of  Mary,  whose  name  is  a                     honeycomb,  whose  picture  enraptures  the  heart,  whose  remembrance  makes                     people languish for love” (Vol. 20, page 2). One year, at the beginning of the                     Marian month of May, he declared, “I am very happy to sing the praise of Mary,                     for whom I wish to shed my blood” (Vol.","24, page 92). “I love you, O Immaculate Mary, the dear dream of my life. After                     Jesus,  you are my love and hope! You know that I love  you!” (Vol. 21, page                     172).  “Through  Jesus,  my  supreme  goodness,  Immaculate  Mary  is  my  sweet                     love, my sweet hope, my refuge, glory, and salvation” (Ibid. page 99).                             Father Vitale, reporting a conversation with the Servant of God, seems to                     throw cold water on the flames of our founder's Marian love:                             “Once, in his simplicity and out of confidence, the padre asked me: “Do                     you love the Virgin Mary as much as our Lord?” My answer was: \"Padre, not                     that much!”                             \"Oh,  yes,  he  said,  it  is  the  same  for  me,  because  my  love  of  Jesus                     overwhelms me!”                             But it is understood that his words “it is the same for me” had a different                     meaning  from  mine,  as  we  realize  from  his  explanation:  “My  love  of  Jesus                     overwhelms me!” Under this enthralling yoke, he perceived love for Mary as if                     under  clouds  that  veiled  his  loving  flame  toward  the  Virgin”  (Father  Mary                     Hannibal Di Francia, page 285).                                                                                                               292                            But, it was not a question of clouds, because the Father's love of Mary was                     perfect.                             The Second Vatican Council states that the nature of the devotion to the                     Madonna  should  be  such  that  “while  the  mother  is  honored,  the  Son  through                     whom all things have their being (Col. 1, 15-16) and in whom it has pleased the                     Father  that  all  fullness  should  dwell  (Col.  1,  19)  is  rightly  known,  loved  and                     glorified, and his commandments are observed” (L.G. no. 66).                             Saint  Louis  Grignion  exposed  the  same  concept  in  different  words  two                     centuries  and  a  half  before.  “Devotion  to  Mary  is  necessary  to  find  Jesus                     perfectly, to love him with all the heart, and to serve him faithfully” (Treatise of                     the True Devotion, no. 62). The more souls are united with Mary, the more Mary                     guides and unites them to God. Mary is God's marvelous echo, which answers                     his name when people say “Mary” (The Secret of Mary, no. 21). This confirms                     the Catholic saying, “To Jesus through Mary.”                             The Father writes, “Jesus cannot be separated from the most holy Mary.                     The praise of Jesus is complete when it is combined with her praise. We cannot                     reach Jesus, but through Mary” (S.C.","Vol. 3, page 87). “Praised be Jesus and Mary” was the greeting the Father used                     in our communities.                             While  exhorting  his  daughters,  he  states  more  exactly,  “Loving  and                     serving this great mother is the only way to know, love, and possess Jesus our                     Lord with union of charity. This must be our final aim. However, those who do                     not seek Mary cannot find Jesus, whereas those who seek Mary will find him.”                             It was from his early years that the Father sought Mary, and Mary filled                     him with Jesus Christ. He concludes, “Love the most holy Virgin with transport                     of  love,  and  you  will  grow  in  any  virtue,  belonging  totally  to  our  Lord  Jesus                     Christ” (Vol. 34, page 219).                        2. Evidences                                How  did  the  Father's  contemporaries  consider  his  devotion  to  the                     Madonna? We point out beforehand that he had some preferences for a few titles            293                     or privileges of the most holy mother. But since the Madonna is always the same,                     any of her titles enflamed the Father in such a way that his listeners considered                     the title he was talking about as his favorite one, because of his zeal, enthusiasm,                     and fervor. By taking this introductory statement into consideration, we are able                     to understand well quite a few evidences.                             “He loved the Madonna under the well-known titles, as well as under the                     ones he found out and submitted to us to foster our veneration for her during the                     Eucharistic year.” “His life, preaching, and writings bear witness to his love and                     veneration  for  the  Madonna.  Since  his  early  years  he  never  separated  the                     devotion to the Madonna from our Lord, lecturing about her under all liturgical                     titles. Most of his poetic work sings the Madonna. For instance, the somewhat                     classical poem (1) to our Lady of Lourdes which Cesareo appreciated (2) was                     written  by  the  Father  in  his  youth.  As  a  preparation  for  the  Marian  feast,  and                     according to the spirit of the ancient Christian vigils, he combined prayers with                     vigils,  fasting,  and  mortifications,  also  fostering  a  \"Virtue  Contest”  in  the                     communities.”","To sing her praise, he wrote many prayers in prose and verse. When the                     Religious practiced the custom of charging themselves with their faults at the end                     of the week, the Father taught them to end their talk with the mother superior by                     saying  this  ejaculatory  prayer:  “Immaculate  Mary,  our  superior  and  mother,                     chastise, but forgive me.” “The Servant of God was very devout to the most holy                     Virgin.  Every  year  he  combined  the  Eucharistic  feast  with  the  Madonna,                     composing  a  hymn  for  each  of  them  under  a  specific  title.  He  often  preached                     about the devotion to her, writing pretty pieces of poetry for the people, who still                     sing them.”                             “He was madly in love with the Madonna, whom he venerated under any                     title, above all as Immaculate, Our Lady of Carmel, etc. If it had been feasible, he                     would have made us Carmelites. Our garb has the Carmelite color.” “He loved                     the  Madonna  unboundedly,  and  made  us  love  her,  joining  us  to  the  Marian                     congregations  and  to  the  slavery  of  love.”  A  venerable  Religious  says,  “His                     devotion to the Madonna was very singular. I remember his preaching about Our                     Lady of the Ladder. It was a masterpiece. But what enraptured the people was the                     manifestation of his sentiments of filial love toward the Virgin, which he infused                     in his institutions.” “He talked to us of the Madonna tenderly, loved her pictures,                     but  eliminated  the  ones  inspiring  no  devotion.  He  was  enamored  of  Mary                     bambina.                                                                                  294                             About 1890, he set a  Salve of his own to  music, and the people of the                     Holy Spirit Quarter sang it... The Servant of God did the same when Canon Sofia                     invited him to preach a triduo for the dedication of an altar to the Madonna of                     Pompei. The people sang his Salve with enthusiasm.                             A  devotee  from  Messina  said,  “He  invoked  the  Madonna's  help  for  us,                     while  talking  with  me  and  others.  I  think  that  the  offering  prayer  we  say  in                     Messina was written by him, as most of the songs that the congregations sing                     during the main novenas.”                             The offering prayer begins, “O Mary, sweet patron…” “As far as I know,                     beginning with the 1834 publications of the rosary by the Dominican Fathers, no                     prayer is more suitable than this one at the end of the rosary.” “His devotion to                     the  Madonna  was  deep  and  varied,  as  we  see  from  the  very  many  prayers  he                     wrote on this subject. One year, he devised the spiritual pilgrimage to Lourdes.                     For quite a few years he led us on a spiritual pilgrimage to La Salette, writing the                     prayers for the going, the","dwelling, and the return on September 29, feast of Saint Michael the Archangel.                     The  spiritual  round-trip  included  Mount  Gargano.  It  fostered  our  fervor  with                     many prayers and meditations.”                             “On the whole, I think that the devotions he suggested to us were his own                     devotions, such as those of Our Lady of Carmel, Visitation, and the Madonna                     under  the  chief  titles.  He  combined  the  novenas  and  the  prayers  with  his                     preaching and the explanation of the daily little sacrifice we had to do. We also                     made  spiritual  pilgrimage  to  Lourdes  and  La  Salette...  One  day  of  May  was                     chosen  to  bitter  our  food  with  a  specific  powder  for  penance  in  honor  of  the                     Madonna. The sister waiting on the Father said that he did so.” “Lecturing to the                     sisters and while urging us to love the Madonna, he told us that he was a lover of                     her since the age of three.”                        3. Mary in his preaching                                “Being enamored of the Madonna, he spoke often of her. At Saint Pier               295                     Niceto,  where  he  used  to  preach  the  novena  of  May  8,  his  words  enraptured                     people. He gave Our Lady, as divine superior, several titles.” “The Servant of                     God was very fond of the Madonna. On the occasions of feasts, novenas, triduos,                     and months consecrated to her, he spoke of her, making us practice sacrifices.”                     “He  was  madly  fond  of  the  Madonna,  especially  under  the  title  of  Mary                     Bambinella,  wrote  ejaculatory  prayers,  and  made  us  repeat  them  during  the                     procession in the institute. Fond of the Marian sanctuaries, he had some grottos                     built, similar to the one at Lourdes.                     After the spiritual pilgrimage he gave us some blessed water to drink. He urged                     us to join the Marian Unions. We all are slaves of Mary and renew our vows on                     the feast of Immaculate Conception. He wrote so much about her in prose and                     verse.” A former student printer of ours remembers: “The titles he gave to Our                     Lady on the feasts of July first are an indication of his devotion to her. I have                     printed so many booklets in verse and prose praising the Madonna under several                     titles.” “Expounding the     hymn Christmas, by Manzoni, he worried about the                     expression","“her pure womb he opened.\" If the poet were alive, he would have written to him                     suggesting  a  change.”  The  Servant  of  God  saw  in  that  verse  the  Madonna's                     virginity denied; or, at least, it was given no prominence. “Any of his preaching                     included  some  thoughts  about  the  Madonna,  at  least  at  the  end  of  the  speech.                     How many titles, prayers, poems, triduos, and novenas he wrote, preached, and                     proposed to others for the Madonna!”                             “As a deacon, he preached about the Madonna in the Messina churches,                     held his vocation to the priesthood as a gift from Immaculate Mary, and often                     went to pray in the Immaculate’s church, where he donated his canonical ring.                     We  have  so  many  manuscripts  and  notes  of  his  preaching,  which  help  us                     understand  how  much  he  endeavored  to  instill  into  souls  his  deep  and  filial                     devotion to Mary. I do not know how many statues of the Virgin he donated to                     outsiders. But it is well known that the spiritual industries he devised to foster                     people's love for Mary were varied and successful.”                             Says a Daughter of the Sacred Side,                             “Enamored of the Madonna, especially under the title Mary Bambinella                     along  with  her  Presentation  to  the  temple,  he  did  his  best  in  celebrating  her                     novenas solemnly. Often speaking of the Madonna, he endeavored to make us                 296                     hold  her  as  a  mother  and  superior,  under  whose  eyes  we  should  work.  If  he                     happened to see a chapel of ours having no picture of the Madonna, he himself                     bought one. He preferred the statue of Immaculate, eyes cast down and palms                     joined.”                              “His devotion to the Madonna under so many titles was very tender, but                     Our Lady of Carmel and Mary Bambinella were his favorite. For the latter we                     say a novena, observe a vigil, and make a procession on the feast.” “The theme                     of his preaching harmonized with the liturgy, but a thought about the Madonna                     was  never  lacking.”  “His  special  love  for  the  Madonna  was  evident  from  his                     preaching and prayers, but he celebrated the Immaculate, the Assumption, and                     Our Lady in sorrow with a particular, tender devotion. His speeches fostered our                     love for the Virgin.” “His great devotion to the Madonna became the lever of his                     holiness. While preaching, he always mentioned the Madonna, and we became                     inflamed.”                             “Happy for bearing the name Mary, he called the Madonna mamma mia.                     When he brought a pretty statue of Our Lady of","La Salette to the community of Trani, the people celebrated festively. They were                     told to expect a great lady with a warm welcome, and they welcomed... the statue                     of  Our  Lady.”  “He  was  madly  in  love  with  the  Madonna  under  any  title,  but                     especially  under  the  title  of  Perpetual  Help,  La  Salette,  Our  Lady  in  Sorrow,                     Immaculate, and Bambinella. I still feel the novena the Father preached in the                     shape  of  a  spiritual  pilgrimage  to  the  Madonna  of  La  Salette.  He  excited  our                     minds so vividly that we felt to be really on the mountainous roads, the stations,                     etc.,  every  day  advancing  toward  our  destination.  On  the  ninth  day,  we  were                     filled with a thrill of anticipation, because we were about to reach the sanctuary!”                        4. The institute's special card                                Let us go into details.                             The Father was born to spiritual life bearing the name of Mary. His family                     had a strong devotion to the Madonna, and his parents used to give their children                     the name Mary as a second name. As to the Father, the name Mary is the first in           297                     the religious and in the civil registry. Surely, there has been a misunderstanding,                     but  the  Father  saw  in  it,  with  a  founded  reason,  the  Madonna's  sign  of                     predilection for him. Therefore, he rejoiced, and gloried in it. He said, “I think                     that the devil raged at that moment because the Madonna took me under                     her particular protection, without which I would be lost.”                             As a founder, the Father wanted the Daughters of Divine Zeal to bear the                     name Mary before their religious name, but he did not give it at the taking of the                     garb. The professed in perpetual vows had to implore the name Mary by asking                     for  it  three  successive  times  with  petitions,  instanter,  instantius,  instantissime.                     They had to prove that they deserved it through their ever more good behavior.                     Then the Father conceded the name with joy, but he reserved to himself the right                     to deprive of such a name the sisters who would become unworthy of it.                             Because grace derives from the Madonna's love, the Father wrote to his                     children,","“Mary  is  standing  before  the  divine  treasure  of  grace.  Whoever  loves,                     trusts, invokes, and honors Mary will grow rich with abundant graces by God's                     will;  but  whoever  stands  aloof  has  no  hope,  because  the  other  exercises  of                     devotion will fail, and perseverance will totter” (S.C. Vol. 5, page 59).                             The Father wanted the devotion to the Madonna to be a characteristic of                     his institution.                             “It  is  the  institute's  special  card”  (Vol.  44,  page  113).  “This  little                     community's  rule  proposes  devotion  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  as  an  effective                     means  to  reach  sanctification  and  any  good  success.  May  love  for  the  great                     Mother of God and devotion to her form a chief point of this little order's spirit!                     Probationers, when the love for the most holy Mary enters our hearts, love of                     Jesus will reign among us.                             What  about  a  probationer  whose  love  of  the  most  holy  Virgin  is                     indifferent? Not only will he not persevere in his vocation, but he will also run                     the risk of going off course!” (S.C. Vol. 10, page 168).                             “The Rogationists of the Heart of Jesus will glory in the greatest devotion                     and transport of love for the great Mother of God, the most holy Mary, who is the         298                     patroness of the order. As much as they can, the congregants will endeavor to                     make the people come to know and to love  the Virgin Mary, propagating  her                     devotion and  celebrating her novenas and feasts with greatest fervor” (Vol. 3,                     page  17).  “May  devotion  to  the  Virgin  Mary  be  a  characteristic  of  the                     Rogationists” (S.C. Vol. 5, page 59).                             Therefore, the Father insists on stressing the importance of this devotion                     for the Rogationists.                             The  congregants  should  consider  the  superhuman  importance  of  the                     devotion  to  the  most  holy  Virgin  on  the  ground  of  the  doctrine  that  faith,  the                     word  of  God,  the  holy  Church,  the  saints,  the  Fathers,  the  doctors,  the                     revelations,  history,  the  monuments,  humankind,  and  the  sanctuaries  say  .of                     Mary. Our teaching that the devotion to the most holy Mary should be more than                     singular  must  stand  out.  It  forms  a  pride  and  glory  for  the  institute.  The                     congregants should use all means to keep the Marian flag high. They will study                     and  consider  the  greatness  of  the  most  holy  Virgin,  will  celebrate  her  feasts                     exactly, some of them with particular practices of devotion, and will appeal to                     her in their needs. They will also endeavor to preach her glory and to have her                     known and loved by souls. They will ask our Lord Jesus Christ to make us know                     and love","his most holy and sweet mother, who is also ours; as well as to be able to make                     her  known  and  loved  by  all  the  hearts.  All  of  us,  our  belongings,  and  the                     Rogation  of  Jesus'  Heart  are  and  will  be  for  ever  consecrated  to  the  sweetest                     hearts of Jesus and Mary! (S.C. Vol. 10, page 184).                             In one of the petitions presented to God in the most holy name of Jesus,                     the Father implored, “We beg you, o Lord, to give us the gift of a tender devotion                     to the most holy Virgin Mary, mother of your only begotten son and ours. See to                     it that this devotion stands out in this institution” (S.C. Vol. 9, page 66).                            Read how the Father expounds the  Rogate as the Madonna's gift to the                     Rogationists, in a little sermon on July first.                             “O Immaculate Mother of God, do not stop giving us your protection. We                     put our hope in you and entrust our interests to you, especially this sacred banner                     (Rogate), which is our glory, and the labarum of our religious expectation. We                     are gathered around it. Through it we are strong despite our weakness, rich in our                     poverty,  and  fearless  in  the  fights:  we  entrust  it  to  you.  Having  kept  in  your                     motherly heart the words spoken by your divine Son, you also kept this saying of                     the most holy Heart of Jesus' zeal, “Pray, therefore, to the owner of the harvest to                     send workers in his harvest.” O admirable mystery of your motherly kindness!                     You deigned to reveal this sacred word, this divine command you kept in your                     heart to us, who are very little children dwelling in these slums. Through us, you        299                     deigned  to  spread  it  somewhere  else,  calling  the  Church's  attention  upon  it  o                     (S.C. Vol. 3, page 157).                             Writing a letter, he insists upon the predilection of the Madonna for this                     little seed, for the sake of the divine command.                             May devotion to the Virgin Mary be a characteristic of the Rogationists,                     drawing upon them a special love from the Mother of God. When Jesus reigns                     among the youth of a religious institute Mary loves them. But she loves more a                     community  of  dear  children  who  besides  devoting  themselves  to  charitable                     institutions also promote the divine command of our Lord Jesus Christ: “Pray,                     therefore, to the owner of the harvest that he will send out workers to gather                     in his harvest.” Of course, Our Lady takes delight in it because she knows how                     this prayer fosters the greatest glory of God and the good of souls. Therefore, she                     looks with particular favor on this community which is the only one having such                     a mission in the Church.                            Since  we  should  deserve  this  predilection,  the  Father  concludes,  “The                     little seed, however, needs to grow rich with holy virtues, especially with elating                     love for Jesus!” S.C. Vol. 5, page 59).","5. It grew over the years                                The Father's devotion  to the Madonna and the role of the Virgin in his                     spiritual  life  grew  over  the  years.  His  personal  prayers  and  the  prayers  of  the                     community prove it.                            When seventeen years old, he asks the Madonna for help and offers his                     juvenile lyre to her:                                   O divine Mother, subvene                                   In the bursting storm of evil;                                   In my verses I will praise you a queen,                                   Holy, and immortal!                                                                                                                (Vol. 47, page 167).                             On  December  8,  1868,  when  the  Father  had  not  yet  decided  about  his                     future,  he  published  a  poem  dedicated  to  the  Madonna.  At  the  end  of  it,  he                     tenderly invokes the Virgin to help him achieve his dream of possessing God:                                   I too weep at your feet, O Mary,                                   in the suffering of my disenchantment:                                   how many errors, inside of me                                               300                                   embitter the life of my soul !                                   But in the flower of my years,                                   kneeling at your holy knees                                   I sought you with tears in my eyes,                                   there I found the cross and the altar!                                                                              (Vol. 47, page 138)                             His varied poems to the Virgin under so many titles are numerous. When                     the congregants were allowed to publish some of his verses in 1921, the Father                     dedicated the volume Faith and Poetry to the Madonna. The dedication is a song                     of love:                             Staring with love -  I offer these humble verses to you - divine Immaculate                     Virgin  Mary  -  star  shining for ever in God's thought  -   the only  object  -  of                     possible extension of the divine creator power  - to a pure creature  to you -  the                     great Italian poets  from Dante to Tasso,","from Monti to  Dante  and Bisazza  -    consecrated their poetic  inspiration  - and                     classical verses  -  sign of lofty poetry -  against which are – the hideous, muddy                     Muse of those who praise Satan -  who is shuttering and writhing under your feet                     to you the sweetest  - the Urbinate dedicated his brushes -  Buonarroti his chisel                     the  oversea  geniuses  and  ours  from  Gounod  to  Mercadante  -   dedicated  their                     enrapturing  melodies    -  to  you,  Queen  of  the  Angels  and  Mother  of  God  -                     animator of beauty, goodness, and sublime  -      very clement Lady - who accept                     splendid flowers -  and humble fronds.                             Besides the petitions  we have mentioned, in which the Father asks Our                     Lady for his own conversion, we have three novenas in verses to the Immaculate.                     He entrusts himself to her in order to improve his virtues.                            The first novena dates back to 1876 or 1877, when the Father was not yet                     a priest. He talks to the Madonna:                             ...I dedicate, consecrate, and give myself to you as a slave. For the sake of                     the eminent virtues, privileges, and prerogatives adorning your head like twelve                     stars, I ask you for twelve graces: 1. Holy paradise for me and for mine, without                     going to purgatory. 2. An ardent, continuous, fervent love for your divine Son,                     for you, Saint Joseph, the angels and the saints that you want me to love more, as                     well  as  a  working  charity  toward  my  neighbor.  3.  A  living  faith  along  with  a   301                     filial  confidence  in  Jesus  Christ's  merits  and  in  your  powerful  intercession.  4.                     Heroic  internal  and  external  humility.  5.  A  perfect  god  like  uniformity  and                     conformity to God's will. 6. The grace of pleasing your divine Son in everything,                     up  to  the  end  of  my  life.  7.  The  holy  priesthood,  ecclesiastical  science,  and                     apostolic zeal in order to work with pure intention continuously, effectively, and                     abundantly for the salvation of souls, for the greater glory of God, and for your                     honor. 8. A spirit of prayer and meditation upon Jesus Christ's sorrows and yours.                     9.  The  grace  of  profitably  preaching  and  praising  your  divine  Son,  you,  Saint                     Joseph, the angels and the saints that you want me to love more. 10. Continuous                     holy recollection, the practice of being in the divine presence, and the virtue of                     silence. 11. A tender, predominant devotion to Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament;                     the grace of receiving him in the host every day; of receiving him in the spirit                     very often, and in the viaticum at the hour of my death. 12. Finally, for the sake                     of your Immaculate Conception I ask you for holy perseverance up to the end,                     and the best grace for my sanctification, the sanctification of my neighbor, and                     the greater glory of God. Amen (Vol. 7, page 163).                             When  he  was  already  a  priest,  the  Father  wrote  another  prayer  asking                     Mary for twelve favors, in honor of the twelve symbolic stars surrounding her                     virginal head.","1. Give me the grace to annihilate my will before the will of your divine                     Son so that the will of your divine Son be mine. 2. Kindle my heart with divine                     love! See to it that the purest flame of God's love penetrate deeply in my spirit                     and rout out my selfishness. Give me a tender devotion to the Blessed Sacrament                     and your holy love in order that I love you as you deserve. 3. Help me detach                     perfectly  from  everything,  creatures,  and  myself,  renouncing  myself  and                     everything to live only in God. 4. My tender mother, obtain for me deep humility                     from God, internal and external humility, a deep knowledge of me, and a spirit of                     mortification so that I humble myself before God and creatures. Help me to have                     contempt and humiliations loved, but myself despised. Mirror of humility, grant                     me the virtue of humility and obedience. 5. Grant me the virtue of meekness and                     sweetness so that I treat people with kindness, especially when I meet the ones                     against whom I feel repugnance. Give me a simple, merry, sweet, gentle, kind,                     benign, compassionate, humble, and meek heart. 6. Impetrate for me a profound                     contrition an intimate  sorrow to  make  my  heart bleed for  my offenses against                     your divine Son. 7. Grant me a spirit of holy prayer, the grace of meditating upon                     the sublime truths of faith, especially the passion of Jesus and your sorrows. Give                     me the grace of praying on the occasions of sin. Grant me a holy recollection, the                     grace of being aware of your holy presence, and the virtue of silence. 8. Grant me                     from  God  the  holy  virtue  of  spiritual  and  bodily  purity;  as  well  as  purity  of                     conscience  through  humble,  frequent,  and  sincere  confession,  for  the  greater     302                     glory  of  God.  9.  Obtain  for  me  a  heroic  faith  along  with  a  loving,  filial                     confidence in the most sacred Heart of Jesus and in your motherly affection. 10.                     Grant me fervent zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of souls, letting me                     perform the duties of my priestly ministry perfectly. See to it that I celebrate the                     holy  sacrifice  of  the  mass  and  recite  the  holy,  canonical  hours  with  deep                     recollection and intimate devotion. 11. My tender mother, give me the virtue of                     fortitude  to  prevail  over  myself  through  internal  and  external  mortification.  O                     valiant Lady, you have won hell. Give me strength to triumph over the devil, the                     world, and the flesh. 12. You are our life and hope, please grant me holy final                     perseverance in the grace of your divine Son. See to it that I live and die saintly,                     and love you in paradise for ever (Vol. 7, page 137).                             A third prayer for the novena of the Immaculate has a different feature. It                     is made of twelve little prayers, each one of them remembering a privilege of the                     Madonna.  The  Father  relies  on  her  for  the  grace  he  needs.  In  each  prayer  he                     repeats,  “Immaculate  Mother,  for  the  sake  of  God  and  for  this  your  privilege                     grant me the grace I need to become such as the Sacred Heart of Jesus wants me                     to be!” (Vol. 7, page 157).","6. Dreaming of Carmel                                The Father thought for a few years that he was destined to live a Marian                     life as a Carmelite, whereas his work in the Avignone Quarter's institution should                     be temporary, because that institution was too sublime to be entrusted to him;                     that the Lord had chosen him to be the starter, but .would send an elect to push                     the institution forward. The Father prayed insistently, “Lord, send the one you                     have to send!”  (S.C.  Vol. 7, page 34, 35).  After entrusting the institution to a                     more expert person, he would become a discalced Carmelite to live a religious                     life closer to Mary. He took action by joining the third order. We have found a                     prayer « to the holy Virgin of Carmel for obtaining the great grace of becoming a                     tertiary Carmelite » (January 1, 1888) (S.C. Vol. 10, page 18). At the end of the                     prayer, the Father does not speak any more of the third order, but of the first one,                     and  asks  to  enter  it.  He  began  the  novitiate  for  the  third  order  on  August  26,                     1888. We have the list of the daily, weekly, monthly, and annual practices.                             Among the monthly practices, the Father notices the supererogatory one                     of  writing  to  the  superior  general  giving  him  the  account  of  oneself.  If  such                     letters were found, we would know better the Father's Marian life. He professed           303                     in Naples on August 30, 1889. (3)                             The Father had no chance to go beyond the third order. But, if God had                     sent the man of the Father's dream... the one God had to send, the Father would                     have flown to the first order! He notices, “On December 27, feast of Saint John                     the Evangelist, after the holy mass, I felt a joyous increasing wish to become a                     discalced Carmelite after inaugurating and handling the institution to an elect”                     (S.C.  Vol.  10,  page  36).  We  do  not  know  what  the  Father  meant  for                     “inauguration of the institution.” Wasn't it already inaugurated? However it may                     be, the elect did not come. The elect was he himself, who was living the Marian                     spirit perfectly, and had to infuse it in his institutions.","7. Holy slavery of love                                The apex of the Father's devotion to the Madonna resides in his perfect                     consecration  to her in the holy filial slavery of love, according to Saint Louis                     Mary Grignion of Monfort's teaching.                            Today, the word slave makes people grimace. We are in the century of                     democracy and absolute freedom, which often go beyond the bounds of license:..                     And yet, Saint Paul was not ashamed of calling himself and the Christians slaves                     of Christ (1 Cor. 7, 22 1 Tim. 2, 24). Someone could say, “slaves of Christ, yes;                     of Mary, no.” Says the saint of Monfort, “Well, if we dislike to be called slaves                     of Mary, it does not matter, because being slaves of Jesus Christ is being slaves                     of Mary, since Jesus Christ is the fruit and the glory of Mary” (Treatise of the                     True Devotion, no. 77).                             Besides, the Marian Legion is based on this holy slavery of love, which is                     conquering the world.                             When  did  the  Father  know  Louis  Grignion  of  Monfort?  Preaching  in                     1876,  he  touches  upon  “a  Servant  of  God  who  lived  in  France  in  the  past     304                     century,” often predicting that “times were not far when the Lord would manifest                     the glory and the power of the most holy Mary more solemnly than before; that                     the most holy Mary would be made known and revealed everywhere by the Holy                     Spirit;  that  she  had  to  shine  with  her  mercy  to  convert  sinners,  to  destroy  the                     kingdom  of  Satan,  and  to  sanctify  the  peoples  with  her  grace”  (Vol.  17,  page                     123).                             This  Servant  of  God  was  Monfort  (1673-1716),  as  it  appears  from  the                     references to the no. 49 and 50 of the Treatise of the True Devotion. The Father,                     however, did not call him by name, perhaps because it was unknown to him. In                     1876 or 1877, during  a novena to Immaculate Mary, the Father  dedicates and                     consecrates  himself  to  the  Madonna  as  a  slave,  but  such  a  title  should  be                     considered as a spontaneous declaration of his fervor having no","relation  to  the  Monfort's  teaching,  which  was  then  unknown  in  Italy.  The                     Treatise of the True Devotion was translated into Italian in 1887 and published                     by the Salesian bookstore of San Pier d'Arena. The Father had it, and that book                     remained in the house of Saint Paschal, in Oria, for many years.                             On June 10, 1888, the Father consecrated himself with a formula of his                     own, through the intercession of Blessed Monfort (S.C. Vol. 9, page 13). The                     formula reflects perfectly the saint's teaching, but it is improbable that the Father                     lived perfectly that formula ever since, because in that time he did not penetrate                     the  deep  meaning  of  the  Monfort's  devotion  as  “a  secret  of  holiness,  and  a                     method of life.” He held it like one of the many consecrations to the Madonna                     that he himself had written before. In fact, for many years after this consecration                     we find no hint to the sacred slavery in his writings, nor in his private prayers, or                     in  the  prayers  of  the  communities.  And  when  he  touches  upon  the  Monfort's                     “secret  of  holiness,”  in  a  speech  of  1903,  such  a  hint  is  a  reference  to  the                     devotion to the Madonna on the whole, not to the specific devotion taught by                     Monfort (S.C. Vol. 3, page 183).                            It  is  not  surprising.  Monfort  teaches  that  such  an  internal  devotion  has                     several degrees, and “a few people will climb only one step. But, who will climb                     the  second?  Who,  the  third?  Finally,  who  will  dwell  in  it  firmly?”  The  saint                     answers,  “Whoever  will  be  told  of  this  secret  by  the  spirit  of  Jesus  Christ”                     (Treatise of the True Devotion no. 119).                                                  305                             Such a secret came to the Father's knowledge several years later. (4)                             It  was  in  May  1906,  in  Rome,  whence  he  wrote  to  his  children,  in                     Messina, around the end of the same month.                             During my trip I have experienced a great treasure of devotion to the most                     holy Virgin, a secret of sanctification, which opens a new horizon on the luck of                     belonging to the most holy Mary, helping find Jesus through her. This particular                     devotion was outlined by a great Servant of God, who has been beatified some                     years ago.                            The devotion I bring to you with the Lord's help is like a priceless treasure                     from far off that will fill the proclamation of Immaculate Mary as mother, owner,                     master, and absolute superior. It is like the answer of the most holy Virgin to our                     proclamation… Through the doctrine of that blessed Servant of God I am going                     to make you belong totally to the most holy Virgin and to Jesus through her (Vol.                     34, page 219).                      We will talk about this proclamation, but now we go back to the days when the                     Father consecrated himself in Rome, in the","Sanctuary  of  Mary  Queen  of  Hearts,  as  Father  Callisto  Bonicelli  of  the                     Monfortans reports:                             We had the good fortune to know him in 1906. While staying in Rome, he                     came  to  the  sanctuary  four  days  to  say  mass.  On  the  last  day  he  had  the                     consecration. We can still see him going to the bottom of the sanctuary, doing the                     solemn act, and remaining with raised hands to pray to “the beautiful queen,” as                     he used to call Our Lady. Happy for having strengthened his chains, on May 13,                     the feast of Our Lady's humility, he left”  (Father Mary Hannibal  Di Francia,                     page 288).                             It was on this occasion that the Father deepened his understanding of the                     Monfort's  Marian  spirit,  as  we  know  from  his  letter,  in  which  he  treated  the                     “Sacred Servitude's Chief Points” (S.C. Vol. 9, page 14). (5)                             Back to Messina, the Father did his best to prepare the consecration of his                     communities to the sacred slavery, on the Immaculate's feast, in 1906. Writing to                     Father Bonicelli, he says,                            “I can never forget the good fortune of consecrating  myself, as the last                     slave,  to  the  most  holy  Virgin,  Queen  of  Hearts,  on  May  13.  I  hope  that  the                     congregants  of  my  institutes  may  have  the  same  fortune  after  my  instructions   306                     about  the  sublime  doctrine  of  the  great  enamored  of  the  divine  mother,  the                     Blessed Louis Mary » (S.C. Vol. 7, page 145). On September 11: “The wish to                     achieve  the  goal  of  Blessed  Louis  Mary's  devotion  is  increasing  in  my                     communities” (Ibid. page 146).                             After inaugurating a picture of the most holy Bambinella in Taormina, he                     writes  to  Mother  Nazzarena  and  to  the  community  on  September  10.  The                     “Bambinella is waiting for something. She expects that all of you surrender to                     Jesus, our supreme goodness, through the perfect slavery of ourselves to Mary.                     She  is  Our  Lady,  superior,  owner,  teacher,  and  mother,  according  to  Blessed                     Louis Mary's inspired teaching” (Vol. 35, page 16).                            The immediate preparation is made by strictly applying what “our beloved                     Blessed, the apostle of the Holy Spirit and of the most holy Mary, enjoins in his                     Treatise  of  the  True  Devotion.  Those  who  want  to  achieve  the  incomparable                     fortune of becoming perfect slaves of Jesus in Mary, and of Mary through Jesus,                     do it” (S.C. Vol. 7, page 146). Specific practices are performed during 33 days.                     Such as: the daily offering of the holy mass through a special formula; twelve                     preliminary days, and three weeks, which aim at","achieving  a  particular  purpose.  The  preparation  begins  on  November  5.  On                     November  3,  the  Father  writes  to  Father  Bonicelli  informing  him  that  his                     children “are enamored of that revealed doctrine, and long for becoming slaves                     of  the  most  holy  Mary!)”  They  are  imploring  the  prayers  of  the  Monfortan                     Fathers, “followers and children of the great Blessed, in order to become worthy                     of perfectly achieving such great sublime fortune.” Furthermore, he begs Father                     Bonicelli “to implore the prayers of his own institute's communities, especially                     the Sisters of the Wisdom, by sending a specific letter with the approval of his                     superiors.  We  will  pay  the  expenses.”  Besides  the  preparatory  practices                     prescribed  by  the  Treatise,  the  Father  added  a  daily  prayer  «  to  the  dearest                     Blessed. From now on, he will be our special patron!” (S.C. Vol. 7, page 146).                     Obviously,  The  Secret  of  Mary  and  the  Treatise  of  the  True  Devotion  by  the                     Blessed  were  the  foundation  of  their  preparation.  “How  much  we  enjoyed  his                     Treat and Secret during this month of preparation! All of us have been deeply                     impressed. These books are full of celestial fire, and shoot arrows burning with                     love for the most holy Virgin, as the Blessed Louis did. For sure, he has a special                     place among the lovers of the Madonna” (Ibid. page 147).                            They observed a strict fasting on Immaculate's feast's eve. The saving was                     sent to the sanctuary as a tribute to the Madonna.                            So  that  the  Father  might  officiate  both  liturgies,  the  male  community                     made the consecration in the vigil, at  midnight; the female community, in the            307                     morning  of the feast.  “In both institutes, we  made the consecration with  great                     enthusiasm and faith... undersigning the acts and placing them in a framework at                     the foot of the most holy Virgin, our sweetest mother and owner” (Ibid.).                            Ever  since,  the  Father  prescribed  that  every  year  the  preparation  of  33                     days, the fast, and the tribute to be sent to the Monfortan Fathers, in Rome, be                     done by the new applicants and the old ones. And how the Father cared for it, as                     well as for the Marian magazine Queen of Hearts, which was the official organ                     of the archbrotherhood. He wanted all his communities to be subscribers of this                     magazine. He did so also with the Daughters of the Sacred Side when he took                     over their direction (S.C. Vol. 7, page 152). He introduced the slavery of love                     among them.                            Saint Louis M. Grignion recommends the “very praiseworthy, honorific,                     and beneficial custom to bear blessed iron chains as a token of one's slavery” (no.                     236). Listen to the Father:                             Now  we  have  to  perform  the  paraliturgy  of  bearing  the  chains.  To  be                     effective, I have conceived how to do it. Up to now, no one has","received  them.  I  longed  for  and  promised  them  as  a  token  of  faith,  fervor,                     devotion,  etc.  Some  persons  are  longing  for,  but,  to  have  them,  they  have  to                     request them to create a solemn tradition. The predominant idea should be that all                     of  us  are  slaves  of  the  most  holy  Virgin,  but  those  who  receive  the  chain  are                     looked upon by Immaculate Virgin, celestial owner, with a particular attention                     and affection (Ibid. page 148).                             On purpose, the Father had already introduced the devotion to the most                     holy Virgin of the Chain in his communities, but he was forced to renounce the                     paraliturgy,  rather  he  limited  the  permission  of  bearing  the  chain,  because  the                     wisdom of the youth did not correspond to their fervor, to the prejudice of their                     health.                        8. To Mary, Queen of Hearts                                The  Father  also  offered  his  poetic  fire  at  the  disposal  of  the  Beautiful                     Queen praised by Monfort.                                                                 308                            “We  notice  that  even  though  he  was  always  busy,  he  did  whatever  we                     asked  for  the  sake  of  the  beautiful  queen  and  Saint  Louis.”  Upon  Father                     Bonicelli's  request  he  translated  Saint  Louis'  song  “My  soul,  tell  everybody!”                     into Italian. This poetic translation became the hymn of the archconfraternity. He                     translated the following poems for Queen of Hearts: “Mother of God, Queen of                     the World,” “I love Mary Ardently,” “The Triumph of Hail Mary,” “I Trust in                     Mary,” “Birth of Mary's Children,” “The Holy Rosary's Mysteries,” “Crowning                     of  Mary.”  Translating  the  lines  into  rhyme  took  some  time,  but  they  wanted                     Italian people to sing them, as they did in France.                             A fault of the copyist brought  about a gracious remark. The  translation                     according  to  the  original  is,  “Who  is  the  man  who  assails  my  peace?  Here  is                     Mary. I sleep on her Heart!” The Father writes, “Perhaps the copyist wrote “may                     she put me asleep \"instead of” I sleep.” Such an idea is pretty and loving,","even though it is different from the Blessed's idea. That we sleep on the most                     holy Virgin's Heart is as a beautiful idea as the one that the Virgin puts us asleep                     on her motherly Heart” (Ibid. page 155).                            The “Song to Mary, Queen of Hearts”, by the Father, about the holy filial                     slavery of love is original:                                               Hail, Mother Queen of Hearts,                                              Paradise of the incarnate Son.                                              The Triad his love to you imparts,                                              Unable to have you more beautiful.                                                  Oh, three times is happy the one                                                  Of Mary's slavery masterful!                                               Sweet knots, gentle chains,                                              You are my sacred long;                                              Oh, tie me in the domains                                              Of the high Queen of heaven !                                                  Thus, as a slave I will belong.                                                  Faithfully to God's regimen.                                               I hate the unhappy days                                              Of the age I spent in vain !                                              My heart, go to the places                                              of the Lord, shedding tears.                                     309                                                  May the celestial Queen deign                                                  to give you her helping cheers.                                               Get up without your parts,                                              As the pitiable prodigal son;                                              Full with love see two Hearts                                              Waiting for your loving spring;                                              One is the king that raising won,                                              The Queen of Hearts is next to the king.                                               Do you dare call you a child                                              Of the parents to whom you rave ?                                              Cast down your eyes reviled;                                              Say, « I have not the name of a son !                                                  May I be the last slave                                                  That the Queen and the King won. »                                               O Blessed Louis, O serene                                              Flame shining with love and zeal,                                              New lover of the loving Queen,                                              Founder of the great slavery,                                                  I beseech you with panting appeal                                                  Make me a slave of Jesus in Mary.","I will be shedding my tear                                               On the traces of your adored feet,                                              I will moisten the mantle                                              of my dear The sublime Queen of Hearts;                                                  Remembrance of my past cheats                                                  Will be an arrow driven with arts!                                               I do not want, do not want the jewels                                              Of my King's and Queen's rainbow;                                              His thorns, nails, and swells                                              Be with the cross in my heart engraved.                                                  The divine Mother's sorrow                                                  Will be the heritage of the slaved!                                                                Messina, July 23, 1906                                                                (S.C. Vol. 2, page 53)                             May God grant us to penetrate the Father's soul to see the results of his                     total and absolute surrender to the Madonna!                             In August 1906, he beseeches Father Bonicelli to obtain “from the great                     Mother of God the very humble, but wise spirit of devotion, respect, and love             310                     towards herself, as the happy Blessed Louis Mary did. We hope to praise him on                     the altars.” (6)                             He  remembers  with  satisfaction  his  consecration  day.  “I  am  feeling  the                     sweet  effects  of  this  grace  I  longed  for,  over  the  years...  Through  unexpected                     ways...  the  great  Mother,  on  the  feast  of  her  humility!  ...Praised  be  God  and                     Mary!” (S.C. Vol. 7, page 145).                             In  a  note  of  October  19,  1907,  the  Father  manifests  the  intention  of                     writing  a  petition  to  Saint  John  the  Evangelist.  He  aims  at  “being  allowed  to                     dwell in the saint's house (in sua), in Jerusalem, to serve Immaculate Mother of                     God  after  the  death,  resurrection,  and  ascension  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ.  He                     wants to serve her very humbly, being always at her feet, loving and serving her                     in  everything.  He  will  be  also  at  the  disposal  of  the  beloved  disciple  and  the                     pious women” (S.C. Vol. 10, page 63). We don't have this petition, but the Father                     lived this spirit of servitude and love toward Immaculate Mary.","9. The priceless grace                                Among  the  joyous  results  of  a  good  consecration,  Saint  Louis  Mary                     Grignion  lists  the  presence  of  the  Madonna  in  the  soul,  as  well  as  the  life  of                     union with her, in various but imperceptible ways (Secret no. 57).                            What  about  the  Father?  Was  he  endowed  with  an  extraordinary  gift                     regarding the union with Mary?                            We  quote  from  the  Father's  notes.  “On  May  13,  1911,  the  most  holy                     Virgin took me a prisoner in Rome, immediately, first in the chapel of the Snow,                     and then before her holy picture” (Vol. 6, page 102). That's all.                            “On August 30, 1912, starting the novena to the Bambinella, he talks to                     her  in  a  petition.  “Kneeling  at  your  little  feet  and  kissing  them  over  again,  I                     present my wish of having you in my heart for three years... May the Heart of                     Jesus grant me this priceless grace! ... My empress, may I be born again and                     regain the lost goods for the sake of the most holy Heart of Jesus, the souls, and                     me! (Vol. 7, page 110).                            Reading the Father, we notice that he was endowed with such a grace.                            “On the happy midnight of December 8, 1913, in Trani, I was kneeling                     before the Blessed Sacrament and the miraculous statue of Immaculate Mary, in             311                     the chapel of Immaculate Conception. I was wearing surplice and stole while all                     were praying in silence. At midnight sharp, the infinite kindness of the most holy                     Heart of Jesus gave me the priceless grace, desired, and sighed by the angels and                     the saints !... At that moment we have renewed the sacred filial slavery!” (S.C.                     Vol. 10, page 90).                      A more accurate study may state exactly the value and the nature of this grace,                     which surely refers to a particular presence of Mary in the Father's soul. In fact,                     after reporting the above quotation, he recalls a strophic unit of his verses to the                     Madonna dells Mutata:                                               In the innermost fibre                                              of my afflicted heart                                              is a joy to all unknown                                              such a good I was given;                                              no sight of creature","can this fortune feature !                                              My serenity is too great,                                              my joy is complete! What a great fate                                              Mary delta Mutata made me meet.                             But  he  does  not  quote  another  strophe,  which  sheds  light  upon  this                     singular celestial favor from heaven:                                               As a fortunate merchant                                              In the paths of life,                                              To buy a pearl gallant                                              I sold everything with strife.                                              My precious pearl,                                              Elect, hidden pearl!                                              Oh, mystery, oh, surprise!                                              Oh Bambina recent born!                                              God's Daughter is my paradise...                                              Mary delta Mutata I adorn.                             The two strophes have this title in the original: “A great, singular grace                     has been granted: the possession of the most holy Virgin” (Vol. 47, page 99).             312                     Meanwhile, the Father notes, “On December 9, 1913, I began 36 divine masses                     for thanksgiving, offer, and petition for correspondence” (S.C. Vol. 10, page 91).                        10. The Madonna                            in the institution                                When  the  Father  began  the  mission  at  Avignone,  he  spoke  of  the                     Madonna to the crowd of children and poor as he did of our Lord, fostering their                     love for Mary through prayers and songs. How tender are these strophes to the                     “Madonna, Mother of the Poor”:","O Mary, beloved mother,                                              we love one another;                                              the children of Eve of course                                              to you have recourse.                                                  Hurry Virgin the beautiful                                                  be to us merciful.

Of the afflicted mother the beautiful                                                  be to us merciful.                                                   The wind whistles and the storms                                              pour down in many forms;                                              O Mary, if you are late,                                              This winter we'll capitulate.                                                  Mother, Mother the beautiful                                                  be to us merciful.                                                   Little children, little youth,                               313                                              little virgins out of truth,                                              women sinners repented,                                              old men by ages lowered.                                                  Mother, hasten to us                                                  have mercy on all of us.                             As the institution progressed, so did its worship and love for Mary.                            The  blessing  of  the  Virgin  Mary  is  done  daily  through  this  prayer:  “O                     beautiful Immaculate Virgin, beginning with this new day we lift up our eyes to                     you, who are the beautiful dawn. O mother, bless and save us. Amen.” Another                     pretty prayer to obtain the holy virtues:                            “O Immaculate Mary, teacher of any perfection, teach us the holy virtues                     so that we may please God, source of the virtues. Give us a living faith, a steady                     hope,  an  ardent  charity,  prudence,  justice,  fortitude,  and  temperance.  O  very                     humble Virgin, grant us humility of heart and of works, as well as the virtue of                     obedience, meekness, and patience. O most pure Virgin, purify our souls so that                     Jesus  may  rest  in  us.  Grant  us  conformity  to  his  divine  will  and  holy  final                     perseverance. Amen” (Vol. 2, page 19).                            The  Father  celebrated  the  Madonna's  feasts  solemnly.  He  prepared  the                     people  beforehand  with  novenas  or  triduos,  mortifications  and  ejaculatory                     prayers, and sometimes with the vigil on","the  eve:  11:30  p.m.  to  1:00  a.m.  At  refectory,  people  were  dispensed  from                     keeping silence, but their talk reflected the solemnity with toasts to the Madonna,                     the superiors, the brethren, etc. One year, on the Assumption's feast, people were                     lacking high spirit at refectory, perhaps because of the hot weather. The Father                     excited enthusiasm quickly.                             -Children, what is there in paradise today?                            -A great feast, Father.                            -Well. What do you think the angels are saying to the Madonna?                            -They proclaim her the Queen!                            -What do you think Saint Joseph is saying to her?                             Not satisfied with their answers, the Father began, “Sweetest spouse, the                     exile  and  the  martyrdoms  ended.  Receive  the  greatest  award;  ascend  into  the                     highest of heaven, up to the right hand of your divine Son, because your humility                     was as profound as an abyss...” And continued...                            The  Father  was  very  watchful  that  all  the  communities  celebrated  the                     month of May with fervor, mortifications, ejaculatory prayers, and appropriate                     readings instead of the boys' sermon, when it was lacking. The month ended with                     the offer of the hearts. Everyone wrote on a heart shaped piece of paper what he                     wanted to say to the Madonna. These papers were deposited at the feet of the              314                     Virgin and were burnt.                            In Messina the month of Mary lasts 33 days, because it ends on June 3,                     feast of Our Lady of the Letter, patron of the city. One year the Father offered 33                     masses  to  the  most  holy  Trinity  in  adoration  of  the  divine  attributes  and  in                     thanksgiving for the graces, gifts, and privileges granted to the most holy Virgin                     Mary, above all for her divine motherhood. On June 3, the mass was offered to                     thank the Virgin for her letter and her particular, perpetual protection upon the                     citizens of Messina” (Vol. 6, page 154).                            In  October,  the  whole  rosary  was  said  in  three  times.  According  to  the                     pontifical  dispositions,  the  first  five  stations  were  recited  before  the  opened                     tabernacle during the mass, in the morning.                            Every Saturday, people meditated on the Madonna, abstained from fruit,                     and listened to a little Marian sermon.                            One Saturday, upon a sister's insistence to eat some fruit","because it was a feast, the Father said, “No, when I was a child I promised the                     Madonna to abstain from fruit on Saturdays.”                            The consecration to the most holy Mary of Perpetual Help was made on                     the first day of each month. In 1886, the Father introduced the devotion to the                     Immaculate  Heart  of  Mary  and  a  prayer  for  the  conversion  of  sinners,  every                     Saturday. In 1913, he introduced the Communion on the first Saturday of month                     for atonement. He did so before the Madonna asked for it in her apparitions at                     Fatima. These apparitions did not come to the Father's knowledge. He wanted the                     picture of the  most holy  Heart of Jesus  and  the Immaculate Heart  of Mary to                     stand out at the entrance of our houses, with this inscription, “I am the owner of                     this house and of those who dwell in it and love me.”                            To entrust the orphans to the Madonna through the intercession of Saint                     Louis, the angelic saint of the youth, the Father formed the Pious Union of the                     Luigini.  It  included  three  categories:  aspirants,  Luigini,  and  Luigini  of                     Immaculate Mary.                            In July of 1903, while preaching; the Father recalls how much sweetness                     Mary gave to the institution.                             Who  ignores  the  sorrows  of  life?  Who  did  not  drink  from  the  cup  of                     bitterness, saying together with the prophet Jeremiah, “The Lord inebriated me                     with  absinthe?”  Bitterness  is  more  than  tribulation,  or  suffering,  or  pain,  or                     affliction.                                                                               315                            Bitterness is a combination of tribulation, suffering, pain, and affliction. It                     penetrates the deepest feelings of the spirit, saddens it, but it does not destroy the                     peace of the soul that is resigned to the divine will. Hence, the prophet Ezekiel                     said,  “The  very  bitterness  is  in  my  peace.”  A  nascent  institution  has  to  pass                     through these paths, and those  who start such works are sometimes inebriated                     with absinthe. What does the most holy Virgin do in these cases? She, who is                     called  sweetness?  She  is  not  indifferent.  She  hastens  to  console  the  afflicted                     hearts, to dispel their bitterness, and to fill them with the joy of the Holy Spirit.                            For  several  years,  on  the  days  of  greater  tights  and  anguish  we  have                     imagined ourselves on a boat loaded with people sailing through a stormy ocean                     in the darkness of the night. No one can see the sky, nor the earth. People only                     hear the rumble of thunder, the roaring storm, and the moaning winds... Then,                     kneeling together at the feet of the most holy Virgin, we have lit the candles on                     her altar, singing from the innermost of our hearts the sweetest hymn with which                     the  Church  greets  her,  “Hail,  Star  of  the  Sea!”  Oh,  the  most  holy  Mary's                     admirable mercy! More than often this Star dissipated darkness, made the storm                     still,  filled  us  with  joy  and  happiness,  and  changed  bitterness  into  holy                     sweetness! (S.C. Vol. 3, page 154).","These were the community's prayers under the Father's guidance. But, he                     often treated the affairs of the houses with the divine mother by himself.                            After presenting a petition to the most holy Virgin, the Father writes to                     Melanie to have her interested in the prayer.                             I tell you that is a matter of a door locked with two keys, and I do not                     know  how  to  open  it.  There  is  a  padlock:  to  open  it,  one  must  know  the                     password: perhaps the word is “atonement or penance” or something like that,                     but, because I do not know how to read it, I do not know the secret to open it.                            Scripture says that when God locks something, no one is able to open it. I                     think  that  the  Virgin  Mary  is  exempt  and  that  she  opens  and  locks  it  at  her                     pleasure. As a matter of fact, the beloved disciple saw a door in heaven, the door                     they say is the Virgin Mary. Consequently, the holy mother not only opens and                     locks the door, but she herself is the door through which every grace comes to us                     (S. C. Vol. 8, page 4).                             The Father's idea is that Mary does not contradict God's will or his justice,                     but God himself adapts the requirements of justice to his abundant mercy through                     the Madonna's intercession.                            The  petitions  the  Father  addressed  to  the  Madonna  are  very  many  and                     overflowing with fervent faith and filial candor. He placed them at the feet of           316                     Immaculate  Mary  or  the  Bambinella.  We  quote  some  passages.  “Ah,  O  very                     powerful empress, have mercy and save us. We have no bread for tomorrow, nor                     dough, nor income. Please work the wonders of your power and mercy.” He lists                     the debts amounting to 3,291 liras, and adds, “For today, December 2, (1899),                     Saturday, the daily bread.” Signature: Slave H. M. di F. (Vol. 7, page 39). (8)                            Another time he presents a list of debts amounting to 590 liras, adding a                     foot                     note.                            “Virgin  Immaculate,  loving  mother,  deign  to  provide  me  with  this                     payment and bless me« (Vol. 7, page 45). “Oh, hasten to help me! Provide me                     quickly with a providence, plus 500 liras. I have to pay 200 liras to T. A.; (9)                     fifty liras to the shopkeeper, fifty liras for the gas, extra money for expenses, and                     fifty liras for Mrs. Nazzarena. December 27, 1900. Slave, slave, slave. Son, son,                     son. Hannibal Mary” (Vol. 7, page 4). We are at death's door. The little boat is                     overflowing with persons in the gale and in the flood tide... Star of the sea, Dawn                     of comfort and salvation, rise!","You already know our situation. Means are failing, and we are deeply in debt.                     Some  debts  are  very  urgent...  We  are  going  to  be  lost!  I  feel  faint!  Children,                     clerics, youth, sisters, poor, and afflicted need food. I have to face all of them!                     Most holy mother, what am I going to do? Who will give me a helping hand?                     You are the mother of help, the helper of the Christians. Save us ! It is enough                     that you want it, because you are the arbiter of grace. O beautiful empress, be not                     late! As for  me, everything is lost. I cannot, nor do I  know what  to do! I am                     fainting! Beloved mother, I want to trust and hope in you! You always helped us.                     Most  holy  mother,  help  us  now,  quickly!  ...  Beloved  mother,  I  am  in  need  of                     persons, of means. Be not late, be not late. Help us. The very pitiable H. Di F.                     (Vol. 7, page 48).                            We conclude these quotations with the following, very significant petition                     ! It reveals the intimate torment of the Father, who is compelled to involve in his                     activities many persons, who are going to suffer with and for him!                            O  sovereign  empress,  Bambinella  Immaculate  Mary,  I  beseech  you  to                     stretch out your powerful had hand to remedy the harm I have done by starting                     this Pious Institution! I am making many persons suffer with me! I am about to                     implicate  the  priestly  honor  and  character  through  so  many  irresponsibilities,                     inconsiderations,  oversights,  and  miseries!  Furthermore,  I  am  heaping  debts                     without  having  the  means  to  pay  them  off!  Ali,  what  do  I  have  to  do?  I  am                     hemmed in on all sides! If I appeal to the people, you know what I find! Now I            317                     am  at  your  feet,  O  my  empress.  Your  heart  is  so  tender  and  merciful  that  it                     cannot help remedying our troubles!                             Then,  he  writes  the  list  of  his  debts  amounting  to  10,250  liras  (Vol.  7,                     page 51).                            The most holy mother never disappointed her faithful son's expectation.                     Through  her  motherly  readiness  and  generosity,  she  always  found  a  way  to                     provide him.                          Notes                         (I) The Father called it a poem. It is made of seventeen octaves.","(2)  John  Alfred  Cesareo  (1860  1937),  a  learned  poet  of  Messina,  taught  for  several                     years  at  the  University  of  Palermo,  where  he  died.  “Ineffable  pains,  which  he                     considered  as  expiation  for  his  faults,  started  him  off  toward  a  religious  conversion.                     Canti di Pan, Poemi dell'ombra, and Colloqui con Dio are the story of his soul upset by                     mystery, tortured by dissent between spirit and sense, but purified by pain and religious                     anxiety” (Catholic Encyclopedia, Vol. 3, col. 1348). Our founder was god   parent. In                     fact, he writes, « On January 28, 1912, in Palermo, Sunday, I was the sponsor of Prof.                     Cesareo's  two  sons,  Guido,  fifteen  years  old,  and  Ug¡m  o,  14.  They  received  the                     sacrament of confirmation from His Eminence Archbishop Lualdi » (S.C. Vol. 10, page                     64).                      (3)    To be exact, we let you know that we have two identical formulas of the Father's                     profession.  They  are  on  the  same  page,  but  one  is  in  Latin  and  the  other  in  Italian,                     having different dates. The Italian one was made on August 30, 1889, at Saint Teresa                     (Naples). The second one was made on September 10, 1895. The Father was given the                     name of Brother John Mary of the Cross, christened Mary Hannibal Di Francia. The                     1889 formula is authenticated by Father Marcellus of Immaculate Conception, delegate                     of the superior provincial; the second formula, by Father Alexander of Saint Francis, at                     Saint Teresa a Chiaia, Naples, in a private chapel. Perhaps the first profession happened                     at the same place, but the Father's name is not recorded in the book of the third order at                     Saint  Teresa  a  Chiaia,  nor  at  Saint  Teresa  at  Museum.  We  ignore  the  reason  of  the                     double identical profession on the same page, at a time difference of six years.                      (4)  The  Servant  of  God  Don  Silvio  Gallotti  (1881  1927)  found  himself  in  the  same   318                     condition with respect to the Treat by Monfort. “As it happens to those who are not in                     favorable dispositions, he read it without finding anythingnew. He considered it one of                     the many devotions” (Father F.M. Franzi, Un Sacerdote di Maria, page 70). “The spirit                     of Jesus Christ revealed this secret to him” after ten years, and he became a seraph and                     an apostle of the Virgin.                             The  same  thing  happened  to  Frank  Duff,  an  officer  of  Treasury  in  Dublin                     (Ireland). He stopped reading the Treat several times, because its style and the Marian                     exaggeration irritated him. Finally he came close to the end of the reading and a new                     world  was  opened  to  him...  After  that,  he  founded  the  “Legion  of  Mary”  (Cardinal                     Suenens, Edel Quinn, page 68).                      (5) Here it is:                                                                                     Rome, May 13, 1906                             The Marian Servitude's chief points as I understand and apply them to myself                     are the following:                            1. I do not belong to myself any longer, but to Mary. My body and its physical,                     social rights, senses,  faculties, etc. belong to Mary, who may dispose of them at her                     will.                            2. The soul and its spiritual, intellectual faculties as well as its powers, rights,                     etc. belong to Mary.                            3. The merits, graces, virtues, either past  or present or future, that I may have or                     practice with God's omnipotent help, belong to Mary.","4. What I possess for any reason, either things or persons, as for instance the rights                     of  physical,  civil,  social,  moral  life,  etc.  belong  to  Mary.  Just  as  a  slave  and  his  things                     belong to an absolute owner and lady who purchased or received him as a slave gift, so my                     things belong to Mary.                            5. Since this donation and servitude are going to be eternal, so also the eternal glory                     that I hope to receive in a Christian spirit belongs to the most holy Mary. She may dispose                     of it, making other creatures she wants to save, share in it according to her pleasure. While                     making this donation, I humbly request that my power to love God and the most holy Mary                     for ever and beyond measure be not reduced by my glory's renunciation.                            6. This perfect, complete servitude will be practiced by these means:                            a. Meditation on the servitude of love and renewal of it.                            b.  Virtual  or  at  least  habitual  awareness  of  the  servitude  in  order  to  receive                     everything in any moment with humble gratitude from my owner's hands as her gift or                     grace.                            c. Request of or at least virtual permission from the most holy Virgin to act or use                     the physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual life. d. Behavior according to the owner's will,                     to  avoid  any  sin  and  to  work  the  greatest  good.  A  Servant  must  take  care  of  his  lady's                     things.                                   d.  Tolerance  of  any  crosses,  suffering,  humiliation,  opposition, etc.  I  will                     hold them as serious, lovely punishments from the celestial owner, who aims at my atoning                     and amending.                                   e.  Filial  love.  I  will  consider  that  I  am  a  son,  who  out  of  love  wants  to                     become a Servant of the celestial queen; or that she adopts the Servant as a son making me                     a son and a Servant altogether, out of love.                                              319                            7. Last end: becoming a perfect Servant of Jesus, our supreme good. He will bring                     about his reign in me perfectly through the most holy Mary.                            8.  Finding  of  Jesus.  If  until  now  I  have  sought  to  find  and  have  Jesus  without                     succeeding, it happened because I circled the mystical city's walls without entering through                     the door. Now is the time to enter through the door, which is the most holy Mary. Amen!                     (S.C. Vol. 9, page 14).                      (6) He was canonized on July 27, 1947.                      (7) We make a correction on this topic. Writes Father Vitale:                            “On a Saturday feast in the refectory, we were relieved from silence, and fruit was                     brought to the table. The padre didn't say anything, but he did not eat any. When someone                     ventured  to  say  that  that day  even  Our  Lady  would  have  been  indulgent,  he  responded:                     “Keeping resolutions is part of loyalty; if we have pledged abstinence from fruit to Our                     Lady, we have to uphold our conviction always” (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page                     314).                            The episode is related by a witness in the process of beatification, but it was me that                     referred  is  to  Father  Vitale.  The  episode,  however,  did  not  happen  on  a  Saturday.  The                     Father cared for the virtue of loyalty for himself and others. If loyalty had been at stake, he                     would  have  had  the  fruit  withdrawn  from  the  table.  I  remember  the  episode  perfectly,                     because the date was June 15, 1924, Sunday, the day of my first mass. I was sitting at the                     Father's left hand; Father Santoro, at the right. The Father ate no fruit. I invited him to eat                     some... He smiled, saying, “Don't you remember our pledge about fruit? I did immediately.                     On 1924 New Year's Day, before we drew the picture for the yearly virtue and sacrifice, the                     Father pointed","out that harder is the abstinence the more we must be joyous for showing our love to                     Jesus. Each one should rather ask Jesus for the picture of greater sacrifice. Addressing                     the child Jesus, he concluded, “O Jesus, let me draw the picture that pledges abstinence                     from all fruits. I want to give all of them to you.” Jesus was pleased. When the Father                     drew the picture, it was the one pledging abstinence from all fruits. I knew the episode,                     but  on  that  extraordinary  feast,  the  ordination  of  the  first  two  priests  of  the                     congregation, I took the liberty of adding that the child Jesus would have been indulgent                     in such a case. The Father however responded, “Keeping resolutions is part of loyalty.”                     In 1924, he did not eat any fruit.                             I remember that the Father let us eat fruit on a Saturday, and he himself ate it.                     Someone had made a donation, but that fruit was so ripe that it would be lost if we had                     not eaten it the same day. We had no refrigerator. The Father explained, “The Madonna                     dislikes seeing the grace of God decayed. It would be against the virtue of poverty.”                     This is part of the Father's spirit.                      (8)To understand well these figures regarding debts and alms, we must keep in mind the                     money's value in those times, when the bread was worth a few cents and a dinner one                     lira.

Numerous and glowing titles                         The stars in the sky are fewer, less bright and shining than the numerous titles                     glowing with celestial beauty, which adorn the one, whom God created as the                     marvel  of  his  omnipotence,  the  abyss  of  his  grace,  and  the  wonder  of  the                     universe. The very  beautiful Immaculate Mary  is endlessly rich  with the  most                     beautiful, singular names and titles” (S.C. Vol. 3, page 203).                             So the Father said. We repeat that he venerated the Madonna under any                     title, seizing any opportunity. Here, however, we briefly remember the titles he                     loved and recommended most. (1)                              To begin with, we touch upon the Father's Marian culture.                             Chiefly,  it  is  based  on  Scripture,  of  which  he  was  so  enamored.  In  his                     youth he studied also the following works: The Mother of God by Father Joachim                     Ventura; The Month of May of the Preachers, a big volume of sermons enriched                     with a collection of the Fathers' writings; Mary in God's Counsel, three volumes                     by  Father  Ludwig  Castigliano  of  the  Friars  Minor;  The  Foot  of  the  Cross  by                     Father Faber; The Glories of Mary by Saint Alphonsus; The Treat of the True               322                     Devotion  to  Mary  by  Saint  Louis  Grignion  De  Monfort;  The  Mystical  City  of                     God  by  Blessed  D'Agreda;  and  Story  of  the  Marian  Sanctuaries,  twelve  little                     volumes, by Vigo. Besides, the Father, who was so fond of his city, had a deep                     knowledge of the religious history of Messina, rich with religious memories and                     Marian sanctuaries.                             To heartily exalt the Madonna in his frequent preaching to the people and                     in his conversation with the members of his institutions, our Father often resorted                     to his Marian culture. He expounds the orthodox doctrine about the Madonna not                     in  terms  of  scientific  rigor,  but  according  to  the  Mariology  of  his  time,  and                     through a popular oratory, which is always required by pastoral ministry.                              Passing over the theological controversies, the Father proclaims","the  truth  about  the  Madonna  according  to  theology,  tradition,  history,  and                     teaching of the saints. The Madonna is Mother of God and men, is Mother of the                     Church,  Immaculate,  co-redeemer,  and  mediatrix.  To  avoid  confusion  in  the                     faithful's mind, the Father eliminates distinctions and subdistinctions.                        2. Mother of the Church                         Paul VI acknowledges that calling Mary Mother of the Church “is not a new title                     for  the  faithful's  piety,  because  it  belongs  to  their  authentic  devotion”                     (Osservatore Romano, November 22, 1964). Leo XIII had already pointed out to                     Mary  as  to  the  “Mother  of  God,  Teacher,  and  Queen  of  the  Apostles”                     (Adiutricem  populi,  September  5,  1895).  However,  because  the  Council’s                     commissions  pointed  to  many  difficulties,  the  Council  itself  made  no  official                     declaration.  But  Paul  VI,  as  a  Pope  having  authority  higher  than  the  Council,                     declared the most holy Virgin “Mother of the Church” at the closure of the third                     session, and added, “From now on we want the Christian people to honor and                     invoke more the Virgin through this gentlest title” (November 22, 1964).                  323                             Even  though  the  Father  made  no  special  notice  of  this  title,  we  are                     recalling it to point out that he had no difficulty to name Mary “Mother of the                     Church.” Such a title  for him was obvious,  and he saluted her as  such on the                     proper occasion. For instance, in the prayer to obtain good workers to the Church                     from  the  Lord,  the  Father  says,  “For  the  sake  of  your  most  holy  mother  and                     Mother of the Church.” Praying to the Madonna, he writes, Immaculate Mother                     of God and ours, you are the Mother of the Church, because you received from                     your divine Son the mission to plant it and to illumine the apostles.” It was an                     evident reference to the Acts of the Apostles (1, 14) relating how the disciples                     prayed in the supper-room together with Mary.                             “She began exercising the office of Mother of the Church by comforting                     the  first  faithful  through  exhortations,  advice,  examples  of  holy  life,  and                     motherly  cares.  In  her  frequent  prayers,  she  asked  God  to  convert  sinners,  to                     confirm the good people, and","to  help  the  tottering.  The  conversion  of  a  thousand  people  through  Peter's                     preaching was the result of Mary's prayer. The loving Savior left Mary on the                     earth after his ascension into heaven to support the nascent Church through her                     motherly care” (S.C. Vol. 3, page 187). (2)                             Lumen Gentium presents the Church as the mystical body, whose head is                     Jesus (no. 7). The Father refers to the “mystical body of all believers. They form                     the great family of the gospel, in the union of the same faith and in the profession                     of the same truth.” As “Mother of the Church,” Mary is committed to save the                     Church.  She  took  care  of  Jesus  in  his  mortal  life,  so  she  keeps,  protects,  and                     looks after the Church of Jesus in this world, because the Church is born of Jesus'                     and Mary's sorrows” (Vol. 17, page 98).                        3. Our Lady of Carmel                         “To  implement  his  devotion  to  Our  Lady  of  Carmel,  the  Father  became  a                     member of the third Carmelite order. Being unable to belong to the first one, he          324                     wished his communities somehow to share it. In his last years, petitioning on the                     feast of the most holy name of Jesus, he never forgot to ask for a special union of                     our communities with the order of Carmel, through which the most holy mother                     should hold us as particular sons and daughters” (S.C. Vol. 9, page 84, no. 30).                             Owing to the very special character and singular mission of our institutes,                     destined  by  the  Lord  to  take  care  of  Rogate,  the  Father  wished  a  “free                     association,”  which  should  imply  no  dependence,  nor  assimilation  with  the                     Carmelites. To avoid any assimilation, he wrote on one occasion, “Due to this                     sublime  mercy  of  the  “One  who  blows  where  he  wants,  and  looks  upon  the                     heavens and the earth below, \" I feel compelled by conscience to keep this divine                     mission and to entrust it to my successors” (Vol. 37, page 52).","This was the reason the Father shelved the case of our aggregation to the                     Carmelite order.                            But his devotion to Our Lady of Carmel was intense. To put his daughters                     under her particular protection he gave the Carmelite color to their garb; and to                     Our Lady of Carmel he dedicated the church built near the institute in Giardini.                         4. Our Lady of Itria and Pompei                                Let us remember two novenas of the Father in honor of Our Lady of Itria                     and Pompei.                            Our  Lady  of  Itria.  Itria  is  an  Italian  word  which  stands  for  a                     Constantinople's  street,  where  the  Empress  Pulcheria  erected  a  sanctuary  in                     honor of the Mother of God as a memento of the Ephesus Council (431). At the                     emperors iconoclasts' times, the Basilian monks stole the sacred picture, landed                     at  Bari  around  the  year  718,  and  spread  the  devotion  in  Southern  Italy.  The                     historians report that such devotion was practiced in 6 churches of Messina, and                     the picture exposed at Saint Nicholas' was famous for variety of miracles. More           325                     than once the face of the picture shone, and shed tears. It happened, for instance,                     during the 1598 earthquake (Samperi, Iconologia Mariana, book IV, ch. 25).                            Nor less prodigious was the picture at Saint Leonard's church (Ibid. ch.                     30).  The  Father  pronounced  a  panegyric  about  Our  Lady  of  Itria  in  1889  at                     Pezzolo (Messina), where the faithful celebrated her feast solemnly.                            Our Lady of Itria at Polistena (Reggio Calabria) is co-patroness of the city                     together  with  the  most  holy  Trinity.  When  the  very  zealous  Msgr.  Dominic                     Valensise was the church's director (before becoming the bishop of Nicastro), he                     fostered the worship to the Madonna by solemnly celebrating the month of May                     in her honor. On Aug. 20, 1885, through the intercession of about 40 bishops, he                     obtained from Leo XIII to conclude the Marian month with a mass in honor of                     the divine motherhood, without any restriction of time and place, as we read                     in a Latin tablet by Father Angelini, S. J., in that church.","While  preparing  the  feast,  Msgr.  Valensise  begged  his  friend  Mary                     Hannibal to write the prayers, the strophes, and the hymn for the novena. The                     Father inserted them into the narration of Constantinople's famous picture, and a                     devout  faithful  printed  this  work  in  Siena  (Tipografia  Editrice  S.  Bernardino,                     1889).                            The worship to Our Lady of Pompei began in the last quarter of the past                     century. The Blessed Bartolo Longo and the Countess De Fusco, who became his                     spouse, fostered this devotion in the desolate valley of Pompei. They had a mind                     to build a little church for the neighboring peasants, but it turned out to be a very                     precious  temple  rich  with  marble  and  art,  famous  all  over  the  world  for  the                     graces and the miracles Our Lady granted under the title of Pompei.                             As soon as the Father heard of the sanctuary, he put his poetical fire at                     Our Lady of Pompei's disposal by writing the above mentioned Salve. He entitled                     it “Greeting of Messina to the most holy Virgin of the Rosary - Pompei Valley -                     with  Strophes  for  Song.”  The  work  was  printed  by  “Tipi  Fratelli  Bertola,                     Piacenza, 1890, but it was not published, perhaps due to interference of Bartolo                     Longo, who was  a friend of the Father. Our founder wrote the prayers for all                     people,  without  pointing  to  a  specific  case,  and  according  to  the  sanctuary's                     story” (Vol. 7, page 143). Bartolo Longo instead had published his novena “to             326                     obtain favors in urgency cases,” which was already spread all over the world to                     great satisfaction of the faithful. Therefore, there was no need for substitution.                     But the strophes and the Salve were welcomed and printed at Valley of Pompei;                     they are very popular in Sicily.                            The Father put the mark of his spirit in the novena by adding two prayers                     to the most holy Virgin of Pompei: one, to obtain good workers, the other for the                     triumph of the Church.                             In  1909,  Dean  Francis  Antonuccio's  generosity  gave  the  Father  the                     opportunity to open an Anthonian orphanage at San Pier Niceto (Messina). The                     church was dedicated to the most holy Virgin of Pompei, and the Father preached                     the novena for quite a few years. The topics of the 1910 novena were: “Our Lady                     of  Pompei  is  the  teacher  of  the  peoples.”  She  teaches:  1.  the  mysteries.  2.                     Vigilance and prayer. 3. The pilgrimage in this life. 4. The works of charity. 5.                     Patience.  6.  Attachment  to  the  Pope.  7.  Attendance  to  the  sacraments.  8.                     Supernatural faith. 9. Resort to her in this vale of tears (Valley of Pompei) (Vol.                     21, page 44). (3)","5. Morning star                                Sister Mary Luisa of Jesus (1799-1875), a Dominican of the third order                     endowed  with  extraordinary  virtues  and  charismas,  was  the  apostle  of  the                     devotion to the most holy Virgin under the title “Morning Star,” in Naples. She                     built and dedicated a monastery and a church to Morning Star. The Father met                     her  in  Naples,  and  after  50  years,  on  December  3,  1922,  he  still  feels  the                     freshness and the enthusiasm of that meeting, in which the pious sister foretold                     his future. “My mind, my heart, and my whole self were planning for my July 26,                     1870 visit to Naples. I experienced such sacred excitement as I stood before the                     gate of the Morning Star Monastery. Then again, my heart swelled when I was in                     the presence of the humble Servant of the Lord. She foresaw my future under the                     inspiration of the heavenly bridegroom” (Vol. 45, page 553).                            The Father became an apostle of Morning Star in Messina. In 1875, he                     published a booklet of prayers and verses, expounded the title Morning Star in a                     chapter, and added, “I have written the novena as a thanksgiving to the beautiful                     Morning  Star  for  a  grace  she  has  granted  to  me.”  The  grace  was  his  healing,                     perhaps.                                                                                  327                            The  devotion  was  introduced  first  in  Saint  Julian  church;  then  it  was                     definitively  transferred  to  Saint  Mary  of  the  Arch,  where  a  picture  by  Joseph                     Minutoli was exposed for the faithful's veneration. On July 25, 1877, the Father                     introduced this devotion to the public through an article in The Catholic Word                     (S.C. Vol. 1, page 18).                          The yearly solemn feast was cared for by the “Pious Union of the Most Holy                     Virgin Morning Star for the Triumph of the Faith”; and a prayer to Immaculate                     Mary  Morning  Star  for  the  triumph  of  the  Catholic  faith  was  added  to  the                     booklet. Besides a crowd of faithful, noble citizens headed by Prince d'Alcontrez                     joined the Pious Union, acting fervently until the 1908 earthquake that destroyed                     the church.                          We remember the Father's panegyric in 1875 and 1877, the novena in 1877                     and 1879, and two sermons in 1880 and 1889. All of them on Morning Star.","6. Our Lady of Lourdes                                The devotion to Our  Lady of Lourdes stands out in the  ministry of the                     Father, who introduced it in Messina. (4)                            As a subdeacon, he preached the 1876 month of May in Saint Laurence                     parish, speaking of the Virgin's 18 apparitions at Lourdes. While remembering                     those days after so many years, the Father exclaimed, “That tender and touching                     story attracted and impressed everyone favorably! The crowd of people increased                     with enthusiasm, evening by evening!” (Vol. 19, page 169).                            Unfortunately, we have only a little page of his monthly preaching, which                     shows the Father's ingeniousness in  drawing wise  moral applications from the                     very simple happenings and humble circumstances in order to foster love of the                     Madonna in souls (Vol. 22, page 138).                             To prepare his communities for the  February  11 feast, the  Father  made                     them say the novena and a special prayer on each day of the apparitions. Besides,                     he saw to it that they built a Lourdes grotto, and he himself led them in spiritual                     pilgrimages over there to obtain graces. The memoirs report that on the occasion          328                     of a long drought in Messina, the Father ordered a procession for three days to                     the Lourdes grotto with prayers and songs. At the closure of the liturgy on the                     last evening, the rain began pouring down while the community was singing the                     last strophe of the Father's hymn to the Madonna, which recalls the miraculous                     rain of Elijah.                             Pure white from the dry horizon                            You appeared to Elijah's view,                            When he said for that phenomenon,                            “See, Ahab, the rain will come.”                            Pure white appeared, out of the blue,                            In the grotto's shadows silent,                            As to say to the people present,                            “It is Mary, the rain will come!”","7. Immaculate                                The Marian title which struck the Father, centralizing in itself all his love,                     is “Immaculate.” Besides grace, also the times and the family's environment were                     contributing  factors  of  this  devotion.  Messina  has  always  been  very  devout  to                     Immaculate  Conception.  The  great  church  built  in  1254  is  entitled  to  Saint                     Francis of Assisi, but this title is usually unknown to the faithful, who call the                     church Immaculate.” This is due to the traditional devotion to Immaculate Mary,                     whose  feast  is  celebrated  in  that  church  every  year  with  great  concourse  of                     people.                            The  1854  dogmatic  definition  lighted  a  flame  of  enthusiasm  for                     Immaculate Mary all over the world. Di Francia's family was very devout to her.                     The mother started her son very soon on this devotion, which improved at Saint                     Nicholas' boarding school, under the direction of Father Ascanio Foti. He was the                     master of the novices, and said his daily rosary in honor of Immaculate Mary                     together  with  Di  Francia,  a  school-boy.  Since  his  early  youth,  Mary  Hannibal                     consecrates  his  muse  to  Immaculate,  who  inspires  the  strophes  in  which  the                     young poet pours out the flow of his feelings. In 1868, he publishes melodious            329                     octaves in honor of Immaculate in The Catholic Word; in 1870, he writes Faith                     and Dogma, a various-measured poem. We quote a strophe, in which the poet                     sums. Up the biblical symbols of the Madonna in a speech of a Christian mother                     to her children:                             The mother is telling her offspring:                            Mary is the star gilding the sky;                            The Most High's clear spring                            Watering the rye;                            The loving dawn dispelling                            The nightly shadows of decoy;                            The rose, the air embalming                            With mysterious joy;                            Palm stretching out a veil                            On the pilgrim frail.","In  1874,  he  sings  a  new  song  to  Immaculate  Mary  with  Sin  and                     Redemption  in  blank  verses,  divided  into  four  parts  and  ending  with  the                     apparition of Mary, who saves the world.                             Spending the sacred hours of my life                            at your feet, O Virgin,                            I say a confident prayer,                            While seeing the fading age                            And the darkness of sins                            So deep around. Yet a hope,                            An intimate, secret foresight                            Smiles at me. You, o Mother,                            Will come again to triumph                            Gloriously. In the brotherly hugs,                            Drawn by mysterious celestial truth,                            The betrayed peoples will rise,                            And the Cross will reform the world                            In its grandiose hands,                            Rising over the ruins,                            Triumphantly redeemer.                                                                                                               330                            We have two more poetic works in prose. The Father called them Psalms.                     One was published in the Catholic Word (December 7, 1878) with the title Sine                     Labe (S.C. Vol. 2, page 232); the other, in The Corriere Peloritano (December 8,                     1894), with the title Hymn ofPraise and Wail ofPrayer (Ibid. page 237). In 1904,                     the Father commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the definition of Immaculate                     Conception with a new hymn.                             As a founder, the Father consecrated his institutions to Immaculate Mary,                     who  is  the  chief  patron  of  them,  and  proclaimed  her  Divine  Superior.  The                     Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  did  it  on  the  50th  anniversary  of  the  dogma  of                     Immaculate  Conception,  on  December  8,  1904.  The  preparation  began  the                     previous December with special daily prayers. The Father explains the nature of                     such a proclamation in the petition to the Madonna,                             You are really the owner, the superior, and the mother of all the religious                     institutes.  Such  titles  are  related  to  the  faith  and  the  wishes  with  which  each                     institute implores and desires this priceless good. Therefore, in our understanding                     we want  you to be the owner, the superior, and the mother of this institute as                     though you were living among us as the owner, the superior, and the mother who                     directs, rules, commands, corrects,","punishes,  supervises,  and  governs  us.  We  ask  to  do  this  in  the  spiritual  and                     temporal matter; in the observance of the rule, piety, and discipline; in the acts in                     common, and in the matter of importance. May the person who governs us as a                     superior be really your vice superior, your vicar, or representative” (Vol. 7, page                     62).  On  September  28,  the  Father  began  saying  71  masses  to  the  most  holy                     Trinity in thanksgiving for the graces granted to the most holy Virgin in her life                     of 71 years. A popular tradition says that this was the age of the Virgin at her                     death.                            As practical acknowledgment of the subjection to the most holy Virgin,                     every  evening  the  house  keys  are  deposited  in  a  basket  at  the  feet  of  the                     Madonna,  in  the  mother  superior's  room.  The  Rogationists  proclaimed  the                     Eucharistic Heart of Jesus as Divine Superior on July 1, 1913, and Immaculate                     Mary as Divine Mother Superior on the following day, July 2. During the triduo                     of preparation, the Father commented the formula of the proclamation in detail                     so that its intimate meaning be well understood by all.                            In the morning of July 2, the thrilling expectation for the unveiling of the                     Immaculate's very beautiful statue came to an end. It was contained in a box in                     the  cloister.  The  altar  boys  with  candles,  cross,  and  holy  water  are  there.  The                     musicians  and  the  singers  along  with  the  community  are  around  it.  Wearing      331                     surplice and stole, the Father begins opening the box with the tools... When all of                     them are going to salute the Madonna at her first appearing, the box opens, but                     nothing appears... the box is empty. As feeling mortified, the Father exclaims,                     Oh, the Mystical Dove has flown... » Following him, all people go searching in                     the  house,  in  the  garden...  Finally,  a  small  light  is  seen  at  the  bottom  of  an                     underground ambulatory, a cooing sound is heard... “There she is, the Mystical                     Dove...  sheltered  in  the  cleft  of  the  rocks...”  The  song-call  bursts  out                     enthusiastically:                              Rise, ethereal dove,                             Leave the stony nest,                             Get out of the ruins                             As the sun from darkness.                             Don't you hear? Crying from their hearts,                             Your children are next; God, your Son, in the tabernacle                             Is waiting for the shepherdess!                            People in procession  begin singing, “Sing  a song, beautiful souls.” The                     Father  wrote,  “It  was  delightful!  The  statue  was  brought  into  the  church.  I                     celebrated  the  mass,  and  preached...  At  noon,  we  proclaimed  the  most  holy                     Virgin absolute, effective","superior, etc... handling the keys, books, etc. Now we feel more secure! Long                     live  Jesus  and  Mary!  Tell  the  community  (the  Father  is  writing  to  Mother                     Nazzarena)  that  the  Divine  Superior  wants  all  of  them  to  persevere  in  her                     motherly obedience” (Vol. 34, page 97).                             As to these original practices, a witness points out that “the manifestations                     of  piety  of  the  Servant  of  God  were  sometimes  childish.  Some  would  have                     smiled  at  his  expedients  about  searching  for  the  statue  he  had  concealed                     somewhere before the blessing; but the orphans followed him and were happy.”                     By  hearing,  these  happenings  seem  truly  childish,  but  the  sharing  of  them                     together  with  the  Father  and  his  spirit  and  fervor  filled  up  people  with                     enthusiasm  and  fostered  their  devotion.  Father  Cosimo  Spina  from  Ceglie                     Messapica happened to be a guest when the Father made the above inauguration.                     After forty years, the priest recalls that event:                             You had to see the Founder's interest in that circumstance, how he shone                     with  his  tenderness  toward  the  Virgin,  whom  he  called  “The  Dove.”  How                     restlessly he searched in the mystical clefts, in the garden echoing with the songs                     which his children were singing in praise of the Virgin. When “The Dove o was                     found, all of them welcomed and brought it in procession. At a certain place, the                     procession  stopped,  some  boys  pronounced  a  few  addresses,  and  the  Father        332                     headed a warm applause with childish simplicity, which I would call Franciscan.                     Then, the procession continued, went around the church square, and entered into                     the church triumphantly with the crowd of the faithful, singing the praise of the                     Mother of God.                             An additional episode of the Father's piety. One day, going from Messina                     to Oria, he found the statue of the Madonna on the altar. It was placed to stand                     out as a mother and a queen. The Father, however, ordered to place it on a lower                     pedestal in the holy of holies, near the children. He said: « I like to see her like a                     mother in the midst of her children. If children do not see the Madonna, they do                     not pray well. »                             Our  communities  prepared  themselves  for  the  feast  of  Immaculate                     Conception with special prayers and songs in the previous twelve Saturdays, as                     well as with sacrifices in the twelve days previous to the feast, and fasting on the                     eve. Usually, the Father was the preacher.","In  the  first  days  of  December  1918,  the  Father  was  expected  back  in                     Messina from Apulia. But a letter from Saint Eufemia of Aspromonte came in,                     announcing that he had stopped to visit our community. Because the parish had                     no  preacher  for  the  Immaculate's  triduo,  our  Founder  decided  to  preach  it                     himself!                            I thought that Our Lady wanted it! We must serve our sweetest mother                     everywhere!  She  will  see  to  everything,  because  she  returns  great  favors  for                     small ones!” (Vol. 32, page 167).                           When the institute was in trouble, Immaculate Mary always reciprocated                     with her powerful protection the Father's filial trust.                           On  the  morning  of  May  25,  1897,  the  sisters  noticed  that  the  wooden                     statue of Immaculate, in the oratory of the Holy Spirit (Messina), appeared to be                     perspiring oil on its hands, chin, and bosom; more on the hair, and a little bit on                     the lips. The occurrence lasted for about a month, decreasing. The base of the                     statue was moist, and people dried it up with paper and cotton. A little bit of the                     liquid  was  even  gathered  with  a  teaspoon  »  (S.C.  Vol.  10,  page  226).  By  the                     vicar's advice, the Father asked Anthony Sacca', a renowned sculptor of Messina,                     to  find  out  the  possible  cause  of  the  perspiration.  After  examining  the  statue                     carefully, Mr. Sacca' said that the cause of the droplets was not the linseed oil.                     Once dry, the oil would not liquefy regardless of the temperature. He also said                     that the poplar wood used for the statue would not produce the liquid, because it         333                     was too dry.                           The Father considered the event a warning for an impending danger to the                     institute, as well as a protection of the Madonna, who was imploring salvation                     from the Lord. As a matter of fact, some time later, the above mentioned vicar                     general issued an ordinance stating that the sisters were to leave and go home.                     This ordinance was delayed one  year to further trial. Meanwhile, Melanie, the                     little shepherd of La Salette, came to Messina and consolidated the congregation.                           The  Father  recalls  the  episode  in  his  Melodramma  for  the  Silver                     Anniversary of Jesus in the Sacrament. Jesus Speaks to the Daughters of Divine                     Zeal:                             With his machinations, the fraudulent,                            The great enemy, had done so much...                            You trembled pitiable and penitent                            Without a look, nor a touch!                             Vigilant on your fortune,                            The sweet mother took you in her lap.                            She moved against the dead importune;                            The ordinance was delayed to avoid the mishap...","How sad were those days! Gracious,                            The mother's statue shed droplets.                            Like a pilgrim sweats anxious,                            So she did for the abolishing threats.                             For you she sweated, asking for a way out.                            She seemed to shed tears with you.                            For you she sweated, to drive Satan out                            Sharing the sadness of the coming ruin with you.                            Our  Lady's  merciful,  motherly  kindness  showed  up:  the  morning  of                     December 28, 1908, the orphans were in the dormitory around the statue of the                     Immaculate  for  the  morning  prayers,  when  the  earth  shook  formidably.  In  the                     midst of a dreadful roar, the walls jolted, and the empty part of the dormitory was                     destroyed under the banging collapse of the roof. As sustained by Immaculate,                     the boys remained standing in a safe place. They ran out safe and sound from the                     catastrophe, whose toll numbered more than 80.000 persons in Messina.                             In  the  community  of  Trani  there  was  a  girl  in  the  last  stage  of                     consumption  when  the  community  was  about  to  inaugurate  a  statue  of  the                     Immaculate. It was in a room next to the infirmary. The evening  of April 12,             334                     1912, after insisting very much, the girl was brought there, and the Father gave                     her the responsibility of lighting the lamp in front of the statue. After praying to                     the Virgin Mary with all her heart, she said, « My Madonna, here I am. I am                     waiting for your grace! » She was taken back to bed. Contrary to the previous                     nights, she slept soundly. While asleep, a vision appeared to her. The statue of                     Immaculate Mary became animated. It moved like a living person, stopping near                     the girl. She made the sign of the cross on the girl's back with the thumb of her                     right hand. It was like a physical contact on her damaged left lung. She awoke                     and found herself sitting up in bed.                             It lasted only an instant. She fell asleep again, and the Madonna shows up                     again, saying, “Daughter, a lung was missing; I have restored it to you. You are                     already healed. Wake up Sister Mary Hope (the teacher of the orphans) and tell                     her to wake up the community. Go to the oratory and give thanks to the Lord for                     the  miracle!”  They  spent  the  entire  night  crying  tears  of  affection  before  the                     Blessed  Sacrament.  In  the  morning,  the  physicians  declared  that  the  girl  was                     cured. The Father immediately informed Pope Pius X, who prohibited to publish                     the event","without  the  archbishop's  approval.  After  one  year  from  the  apparition,  the                     diocese began the canonical examination, which ended with the declaration of a                     miraculous healing... The proceedings were sent to the Sacred Congregation of                     Rites in Rome.                            The miraculous statue with joined palms, which the Father liked so much                     and  defined  “the  glorified  humility,”  was  made  by  Cantalamessa.  The  Father                     bought a statue of this kind for the male community of Messina in 1911; but,                     after the miracle of Trani he saw to it that all his institutes have the same statue.                     Also other religious communities were provided with it. The perspiring statue of                     Immaculate Mary is at the Holy Spirit.                        8. Our Lady of the Sacred Letter                                As  a  citizen  of  Messina,  the  Father  could  not  help  nourishing  a  deep                     feeling of love toward the glorious patron of the city, the most holy Virgin of the                     Sacred Letter.                                                                            335                            It is obvious that the Father put his muse at disposal of the Madonna on                     the day of her feast, June 3. In 1868, he published a saflic ode; in 1870, a hymn;                     in 1871, melodious octaves, in which he sang the historical events of the Mother                     of the Letter; in 1879 and 1892, two psalms.                            When he was a youth, the Father thought that the tradition about Our Lady                     of the Letter was tardy and lacking solid evidence. It was his confessor, Canon                     Ardoino, that led him to the study of the documents of the past, as the Father                     himself reveals in the eulogy for Canon Ardoino. “I feel grateful to you, and I                     bless your holy memory from the innermost of my heart, because you led me to                     learn, appreciate, and love this great glory and treasure, of which I was unaware,                     as many citizens are today” (Vol. 45, page 14).                            He devoted himself to study the expert authors, such as Belli, Saint Peter                     Canisio, Perrimezzi, Samperi, and many others.                            These  authors  date  back  to  1600.  The  subsequent  writers  reaching  to                     Baron Nicholas Gallucci and Father Fazolis of Turin, of the second half of 1800,                     as well as Father Robert of Nove in","his preaching of 1928, made only popular, hortatory works. They accepted the                     tradition  as  it  was  presented  by  the  previous  authors.  From  1600  to  modern                     times, literary criticism has gone so far as to even bite the pages of the gospel!                     Could the Sacred Letter be spared? No matter how, we cannot charge the Father                     with lack of study, since he had chosen to plunge into the work of the poor and                     the abandoned children. He had no time, nor will to be engulfed into questions of                     historical  criticism.  As  to  the  tradition  of  the  city,  he  trusted  the  authors  who                     merited his respect and faith; therefore, he said, « This glorious tradition is based                     on  incontrovertible  documents  >>  (Vol.  47,  page  185).  He  acted  accordingly,                     also exhorting his children to study the tradition and to keep the worship of Our                     Lady of the Letter in Messina.                            He wrote a booklet about the embassy of Messina to the most holy Mother                     of God and how they received the letter. She assures the city of her blessing and                     perpetual protection. The prayers and verses of the Father are still used in the                     cathedral for the novena.                            In 1881, he preached the month of May on Our Lady of the Letter in the                     parish  of  Saint  Laurence.  He  talked  about  the  protection  that  the  Virgin  gave                     Messina during the centuries with miracles, apparitions, and miraculous pictures,                     which originated several Marian sanctuaries in the city and environs.                     336                            In 1890, he said the panegyric in the cathedral, on the solemn feast of June                     3.  He  tried  to  be  always  present  on  this  feast,  giving  his  filial  homage  to  the                     celestial patron. One year, he was in Naples, but said mass in the church of the                     Sacred Letter (Vol. 32, page 130).                            As to our communities, he ordered a novena for their preparation for the                     feast of Our Lady of the Letter.                            Let us recall his panegyric in Messina on June 3, 1909, when the citizens                     celebrated  the  feast  in  a  barrack,  over  the  earthquake's  ruins.  On  that  pitiable                     circumstance, they had not even thought of a preacher. As soon as it came to the                     Father's knowledge, he went to the archbishop on the eve of the feast and offered                     himself to make a speech during the Pontifical Mass. He addressed the faithful,                     “Indulging  in  rhetoric  today  would  be  a  crime.  What  matters  to  me  is  your                     steadfast faith in the perpetual protection, which the Mother of God has promised                     to us. » Then, he continued saying that the punishment had not come to lead to                     perdition, but to correction, as it happened in the past; thus,","Messina  would  rise  purified  from  its  misfortune.  Tears  and  sobbing  of  the                     faithful sealed the words of the preacher, who exhorted them to renew their                     faith in the protection of the Madonna, and to sanctify their lives.                        9. Mary Bambina                                We have already seen some evidences about the Father's devotion to Mary                     bambina;  now,  we  quote  additional  ones.  “He  was  so  fond  of  the  Madonna,                     especially under the title of Bambinella. He quoted a saint, “Whoever loves the                     Madonna is sure of going to heaven.”                            “He loved so much the Madonna, above all under the title of Immaculate                     and  Mary  Bambina.  He  wrote  verses  and  hymns,  which  he  used  to  sing  with                     raised  hands.  But  the  Bambina  was  the  poetry  of  his  heart.  We  are  unable  to                     describe his preaching on her feast. With naivete of his own, smile and words                     gushing out tender and creative, he brought us in spirit to Nazareth, making us                     waiting for Joachim's and Anna's permission to visit the new-born child. We still         337                     feel  it,  but  do  not  know  how  to  express  it.  »  He  was  madly  in  love  with  the                     Bambinella. He let people photograph himself bearing her in his hands.                            The  Father  wanted  the  statue  of  the  Bambina  in  each  house,  and  the                     solemn  celebration  of  her  feast  was  prepared  with  novena,  prayers,  sacrifices,                     and vigil on the eve. A procession through the house in the evening concluded                     the feast. You can imagine how the Father exclaimed vibrantly and heartily in                     between prayers and songs, « Long live Mary Bambinella! Long live the beloved                     by  God!  Long  live  the  empress  of  the  universe!  Long  live  the  sovereign                     enchantress of hearts! »... And the community responded enthusiastically! Long                     live! Long live! »...                            The devotion to Mary Bambina is particularly connected with the house of                     Taormina, which was dedicated to her from its origin and had her statue placed                     in the refectory. The divine mother was pleased and showed that she had to hold                     an important position in that house. But, let us follow the events.                              A hive of about 600 bees donated by Father Anthony Catanese","was in the courtyard.  The  morning  of July  26, 1906, people went to open the                     beehive, but found it empty. Mother Carmel D'Amore informed the Father, who                     smiled at the news.                            The same morning, the sister sacristan was putting things in order when                     she found a little statue in such an unrecognizable state that she mistook it for                     Saint Anthony. She brought the statue to the Father just when Mother D'Amore                     was informing him about the empty hive. As soon as the Father saw the statue,                     he exclaimed, “Oh, this is not Saint Anthony, but Mary Bambina ! Addressing                     the mother superior, he added, “She is the queen bee, and our souls are the bees.”                            The  Father  brought  the  statue  to  Messina,  made  the  painter  Salvatore                     Ferro restore it, and the sisters of the Holy Spirit dress it as a queen. Then the                     statue was brought back to Taormina. On the night between September 7 and 8                     “he  sounded  the  reveille  at  11:15  p.m.  The  community  entered  the  sacristy  to                     pray  before  the  divine  Bambinella.  Then  the  statue  was  brought  in  procession                     with candles and songs through the house, and was placed in its niche. With joy                     of the orphans and accompanied by the music of harmonium, we said the prayer                     to Immaculate Bambina” in the open loggia. The sky was serene. The candles                     lighted before the sacred statue burned in the still of the night” (Vol. 35, page 16,     338                     see S.C. Vol. 5, page 237).                             The color of the statue grew pale at the exposure to sunlight. The Father                     made it restored again in August of 1908. To excite his children's enthusiasm,                     after announcing the return of the statue to Taormina, the Father brought it a few                     days before November 21, feast of the Presentation of the most holy Virgin in the                     temple.  But, the  Bambinella  was not the same any  longer; she had grown up,                     wearing  a  pretty  dress  in  attitude  of  blessing  with  her  little  hand.  The  Father                     expounded his plan to the community. The Bambinella was already three years                     old; he wanted to commemorate her presentation in the temple, where she lived                     for twelve years, according to an ancient tradition. Therefore, he made the sisters                     prepare a room for the Divine Superior. The room was called Conservatorio. The                     members of the community were given a Jewish name, and all of them should be                     at  the  service  of  the  divine  owner  to  counterbalance  her  hidden  life  in  the                     Jerusalem's conservatorio.                             In  the  evening  of  November  20,  the  Bambinella  was  brought  to  Saint                     Catherine's church. The following morning she was","accompanied  to  the  institute  by  two  persons  who  symbolized  the  Madonna's                     parents.  As  soon  as  they  entered  the  church,  the  Bambinella  was  warmly                     welcomed  and  brought  to  the  altar.  Everyone  can  imagine  how  the  Father                     fervently  greeted  her,  inviting  her  to  dwell  in  that  house  in  the  midst  of  her                     daughters and slaves of love... We quote two strophes the Father wrote on that                     occasion.                             Hail, loving Bambina,                            Mystic tuberose                            Which the empyreal fields                            Make gloze.                            Your fragrances breath                            The virtues divine                            Which the souls refine                            To the heavenly wreath.                             O tender child, are you coming                            In your celestial coat ?                            O longed for, talk to us                            With your holy note!                            Make us share a gleam                            Of your pretty face;                                                               339                            With your divine grace                            Your daughters will be supreme.                            On that circumstance, the Father dictated the following inscription:                            To the three years old - Immaculate Mary Bambina - who enters the house                     - of the Daughters of Divine Zeal - by the Heart of Jesus -in Taormina - to dwell                     for twelve years - as she entered the Conservatorio - by the side of Jerusalem                     temple -then unknown - now known and welcomed - by her slaves and daughters                     - as superior, teacher, mother, and owner.                            Beginning in 1908, November 21 was a fixed date for the Father. Until                     1920 he never failed to stay in Taormina for the Bambinella's anniversary, giving                     her his service of chaplain slave of the divine Bambina.                            In  1917,  people  thought  that  the  danger  of  torpedoes  in  the  strait  of                     Messina could retain the Father from going to Taormina. But, on August 10, the                     Father wrote from Altamura, “I always keep in mind the Taormina community                     with the divine superior, who lets me be away until November 15. On that day                     she tells me, “Come here quickly, return to my feet!” “yes, my lady.","With  your  divine  help,  on  November  21  I  will  be  at  your  feet  as  a  slave  and                     unworthy son!... » (Vol. 34, page 33).                            At the end of October, in the days when the military front broke, a ship                     sank  in  the  strait,  perhaps  because  of  a  mine.  Our  Founder  and  Father  Palma                     decided to pass the strait by a little boat. Writes the Father, « The waves were                     strong, and the sea seemed to engulf us. Smashing against the boat, the water                     sprayed us. We spent our time saying a hundred requiems, and other prayers to                     the most holy Mother, Saint Francis of Paola, Saint Anthony, the holy apostles,                     etc. Our sailing lasted an hour. We landed at Ringo, and got a bus for the station                     » (S.C. Vol. 5, page 257).                            On  January  23,  1921,  her  fifteenth  birthday,  Mary  got  married  to  Saint                     Joseph, according to the ancient missal. From then on, Saint Joseph's statue was                     placed near the Virgin Mary in the chapel. Mary's parents, Saint Anna and Saint                     Joachim, were placed to the side of them, and the chapel was called, « The room                     of the divine superior. »                            How  watchful  people  were  to  be  respectful  toward  the  celestial  lady!                     Sister Lauretana, the doorkeeper of Taormina, reports that one day she rushed to                     open the door without venerating the Bambinella while passing in front of her.            340                     The Father stopped her, saying, « So do you treat the queen of heaven? You must                     bow  down  before  going  out.  »  The  sister  remembered,  «  I  still  hear  the                     admonishing voice of the Servant of God. »                        10. Mary's sorrows                                Since we are so indebted to Mary's sorrows, the Father wanted us to be                     very devout to her under the title « Our Lady in Sorrow. » He preached:                             « When we go to heaven, we will share the glory of Jesus and Mary; but,                     while living in this vale of tears, we have to weep with them. We should busy                     ourselves in contemplating Jesus' and","Mary's sorrows, and all devotions to the most holy Virgin should make reference                     to her in sorrow. In any picture of Our Lady, we have to see her suffering )»                     (Vol. 21, page 69).                             Specifically, he wanted us to meditate on the Madonna's desolation, above                     all on holy Saturday, the time which reminds us of Mary suffering while Jesus                     was in the sepulcher. We quote:                             The contemplation of Mary's sorrows is different from the contemplation                     of Mary desolate, because her pains are different. The latter are the peak of them.                     When Our Lady is suffering together with her son Jesus, she shares his pains, his                     bitter cup, she is in sorrow. When Jesus dies, she becomes desolate, and the cup                     of her sorrows reaches the brim, overflowing. »...The martyrdom of the desolate                     began at Jesus' death: « Jesus bowed his head and died » (Jn. 19, 30). In that                     moment his pains ended: Jesus, the man of suffering, stopped suffering. But, the                     partner of his suffering, the co-redeemer of humankind  did not stop suffering.                     Rather she entered the endless sea of desolation! (Vol. 20, page 69).                             The liturgy of that time consecrated two feasts to Our Lady in Sorrow:                     Friday  before  Palm  Sunday  and  September  15.  The  Father  celebrated  both  of                     them  in  our  communities  with  special  prayers,  but  the  preparation  for  Friday   341                     before Palm Sunday lasted seven Fridays.                            On  the  feast  of  September  1913,  two  sisters  had  gone  to  Bordonaro                     begging must. The Father called them back urgently.                            I am very sorry that you dared go begging must on the day sacred to Our                     Lady in Sorrow, who is the divine superior, leaving out preaching, liturgy, and                     the  monthly  retreat!  I  am  also  very  sorry  that  your  superior  gave  you  such  a                     permission. Return to Messina quickly! » On that occasion he did not sign « The                     Father, » but « Canon H. M. Di Francia » (Vol. 34, page 99).                            We find an edifying episode about Our Lady in Sorrow in the Father's life.                     He writes: « On February 11, 1905, the Pastor Chille' gave us the beautiful statue                     of Our Lady in Sorrow and Immaculate (sic): two mysteries related to February                     11 » (S.C. Vol. 10, page 235). The statue was abandoned in the sacristy's pantry                     at  Saint  Anthony  Abbot's  (the  former  parish  of  Avignone  Quarter),  and  the                     Father had asked for it.                             The Father hastened to bring it to the Holy Spirit by coach. He rang the                     bell, gathered the community, and announced the arrival of a great lady, who was                     waiting  in  the  parlor...  when  who  should  appear  but  a  statue  carried  by  the                     hands... hurrah, applause, and prayers burst out. The statue, however, was in bad                     condition.  It  was  without  feet.  The  Father  had  it  restored  and  wearing  new                     clothes, making her enter again on May 19, 1906.","The  Father  was  in  Rome,  so  the  sisters  organized  the  welcome  in  the                     Father's style, informing him. He answered,                            You wrote to me about our sweetest mother, owner, master, and superior's                     entrance  in  this  lucky  community,  making  my  cool  heart's  flint  spring  a  few                     tears! May your Immaculate Mother in Sorrow, and superior bless you daughters,                     disciples, and subjects filling you with her most chosen graces. May she make                     you always grow more in the holy fervor of love and service for the consolation                     of the Celestial Queen of Hearts. Love for the most holy Virgin mainly consists                     in  the  imitation  of  her  virtues,  especially  humility,  purity,  strong  and  constant                     love for our Lord, zeal for his glory and salvation of souls as well as great charity                     and meekness in all encounters.                           Everything  you  had  arranged  for  the  hearty  reception  of  our  sweetest                     Mother was wonderful, inspired, and pleasant to her and her divine son Jesus. I                     did not deserve being there, and I was unaware of it! (Vol. 34, page 219).                            The Father placed that statue on the side of the superior general's room to                     remind  the  sisters  that  the  superior  general  is  the  vicar  of  Our  Lady.  A  sister                     remembers, « He cautioned us to pay respect to it, every time we passed in front                     of it. »                                                                                                               342                       11. Our Lady of La Salette                                0wing  to  the  Father's  relations  with  Melanie  Calvat,  who  had  seen  the                     apparition of the virgin at La Salette at the age of fourteen, the devotion to Our                     Lady of La Salette stands out in his life.                             The Father was not yet a priest when he talked about the apparition of Our                     Lady at La Salette in his preaching in Saint Laurence's church, on September 22,                     1877. The manuscript of his speech (Vol. 18, page 130) has this note under the                     title: Melanie was present. » But, the note by the Father's handwriting is written                     with the same ink he used in the years","1897-1898, when Melanie was in the institute. Obviously, the news was confided                     by  Melanie  to  him.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  in  that  time  Melanie  went  to  Father                     Cusmano, in Palermo, where she spent some time, and passing through Messina                     incognito, she stopped to listen by chance to the Father's preaching on La Salette.                            The  devotion  to  Our  Lady  of  La  Salette  was  being  practiced  for  a  few                     years. The society of Our Lady of La Salette had been erected at Saint Nicholas                     archbishopric in 1878 (The Catholic  Word,  April 30, 1878). The  same society                     was erected at Saint Mary of the Slaves, under the cathedral, in the chapel of Our                     Lady  of  La  Salette,  in  which  the  faithful  placed  a  very  beautiful  statue  from                     Paris. The chapel was restored with taste and without thought of cost in 1892,                     and the solemn feast of that year was prepared « by a devout triduo preached by                     the young priest Don Francis Vitale » (Corriere Peloritano, September 22, 1892).                            After Melanie came to Messina, the Father felt himself more obliged to                     cultivate and spread this devotion as a thanksgiving to the most holy Virgin, from                     whom  he  was  expecting  the  institute's  salvation.  He  also  published  a  booklet                     about the apparition of the Virgin with prayers and verses for the stations.                            In 1898, the Father made a pilgrimage to the holy mountain < to thank the                     Mother of God for having sent Melanie to the Pious Institution for as long as             343                     God wants. » He writes to Melanie,                            I was unworthy of going to the feet of Our Lady, Queen and Mother, the                     most  holy  Mary  of  La  Salette.  I  am  unable  to  express  what  I  have  felt.  Here                     people  feel  the  most  holy  Virgin's  presence.  The  place  is  very  picturesque,                     solitary,  and  silent.  At  the  time  of  the  apparitions,  such  a  solitude  among  the                     mountains had to enrapture the soul who was far from creatures, seeking God                     alone while the quiet cattle was grazing about... As soon as I arrived, I knelt at                     the  feet  of  our  sweetest  celestial  Mother,  represented  by  the  beautiful  bronze                     statues, masterpieces of art and faith. As a sinner, I began thawing my heart, but I                     still need to be presented to the most holy  Virgin through a letter of the little                     shepherd. I have to present the other letters and petitions... Until now, I have not                     yet put on the priestly robes to present myself on the altar to my august Lady and                     Mother, in the abyss of my nothingness » (S.C. Vol. 8, page 10).                            The Father spent three days at the Madonna's feet at La Salette, but he did                     not unveil the secret of his love toward the celestial Mother.                             While praying before the three bronze statues representing","three different stages of the apparition, he regretted that no lamp was burning in                     the  night  before  the  statues.  He  sent  to  the  sanctuary  a  significant  gift:  three                     bronze angels, one meter in height, by Ditta Bertarelli, bearing a lamp in the left                     hand, and this inscription with the right one, « The angels of Messina illumine                     the Queen of the Alps, the most holy  Virgin of La Salette, in the darkness of                     these mountains. O Mary, Mother of God, the city of your sacred letter greets,                     loves, and begs pardon from you. »                            Because the Father meant that the offering be a gift of the city, he started a                     course  of  preaching  on  La  Salette  in  the  churches  of  the  city,  such  as  Saint                     Clement,  Catalani,  Annunciation  of  the  Theatines,  etc.  On  that  occasion,  he                     exhibited the design of the angels to the public.                             On  several  occasions,  he  made  his  communities  make  spiritual                     pilgrimages  to  La  Salette.  The  first  one  was  on  September  19,  1898,  at  his                     coming back from the sanctuary. He writes,                             When I came back from La Salette, I proposed a spiritual pilgrimage to                     Sister  Mary  of  the  Cross  (Melanie),  who  planned  the  pilgrimage  with                     enthusiasm, and set up the standard. The three stations were fixed in the west. At                     the foot of the first station representing the crying Madonna, we placed a vessel         344                     filled with water mixed with the prodigious one of La Salette; it represented the                     miraculous source. We began the procession on September 19 with prayers and                     songs  that  I  wrote  for  that  occasion,  and  Melanie  pilgrimaged  with  us.  We                     celebrated  our  arrival  at  La  Salette  on  the  anniversary  of  the  apparition.  We                     prayed, offered written petitions to the most holy Virgin, sang the hymns of the                     three stations, and the French song « Je to benis, o Montagne cherie, » which has                     an  angelic  leitmotive!  Because  a  missionary  priest  plays  the  recital  of  the                     apparition when a pilgrimage reaches the mountain, I asked Melanie to give the                     account of the events at our spiritual pilgrimage. The humble Servant of the Lord                     at first refused, being repugnant talking about herself, but, warmly urged by me,                     at the end she accepted the invitation. We were deeply silent around her before                     the three stations in the open, calm air. According to her custom, Melanie began                     the  narration  with  a  very  feeble,  gentle  voice,  «  I  was  watching  my  owner's                     cows... » and continued narrating the apparition of the most holy Mary. After the                     recital, Melanie distributed the water with a little glass, which I still keep. These                     are very tender memories if we have simple faith in God, love Jesus and Mary,                     practice virtue, and live in the hope of everlasting life!>) (Vol. 45, page 84).","12. Our Lady of Mercy                          The devotion to Our Lady of Mercy was very popular in Messina and one of the                     Father's first devotions; in fact, a church dedicated to Our Lady of Mercy was                     near his family house, he often went over there, and as an altar boy he said a                     panegyric  in  honor  of  Our  Lady.  In  1918,  on  occasion  of  the  centenary,  the                     Father  sought  to  renew  such  devotion  in  the  faithful,  after  the  earthquake  had                     buried so many monuments. He writes to Father Vitale on July 13, 1918, < On                     the centenary of the most holy Virgin of Mercy let us endeavor to be freed from                     spiritual slavery through the most holy Mother » (Vol. 32, page 138). On July 18,                     1918,  «  besides  our  two  communities,  see  to  it  that  the  faithful  of  Messina                     participate; our city had three churches dedicated to Our Lady of Mercy!... You                     should advertise according to the news of the circular, the membership card, etc.                     The novena with prayers, songs, and hymn is in the Bisazza booklet, as indicated                     in the circular. Please exhort the faithful to attend the mass at midnight. » By                     mailing  booklets,  cards,  scapulars,  medals,  etc.,  the  Father  exhorted  the                     Daughters of the Sacred Side, the Sisters of Morning Star, etc., to celebrate the                     centenary. By authorization of the vicar general of the Mercedarians, the Pious                     Union of Our Lady of Mercy was erected in the houses of Messina and Oria. To              345                     foster  the  devotion  in  the  congregants,  the  Father  wrote  two  circulars,  one  on                     June 13, the other on July 16. After briefly describing the origin of the Nerce-                     darians,  their  aim,  and  glory,  the  Father  recalls  the  letter  of  the  Holy  Father                     Benedict XV to the vicar general of the order. The Pope indicated the aim of the                     celebration: « To obtain from the most holy Virgin redeemer of the slaves the                     grace of being freed from the devil's slavery, from sin, and passions. »                          Writes the Father,                         To achieve this aim, I call the attention of our communities to celebrate this                     centenary with devotion and living faith so that the  most  holy Mother free us                     from  any  bond  of  passion,  break  the  attachment  to  ourselves,  our  wishes  and                     tendencies. May we gain the freedom of spirit and the union of love with Jesus,                     our Lord and God.                         Since we glory in being slaves of love of our Divine Superior and Mother, let                     us achieve the centenary's intention: being free from the slavery of sin. Let us be                     more bound and tied to Jesus and to the most","holy  Virgin  Mary  with  the  strong,  sweet  chains  of  divine  love  (Vol.  34,  page                     140).                        13. Our Lady of Vena                         The  devotion  to  Our  Lady  of  Vena  is  a  legacy  of  the  Father  to  the  house  of                               Giardini.                      Vena is a hamlet of Piedimonte Etneo, in the diocese of Acireale (Catania). It has                               a  renowned  sanctuary  which  was  built  to  remind  the  faithful  of  the                               quick  spring  of  water  under  the  pawing  horse  that  was  carrying  a                               picture of the Madonna. According to the tradition, the event happened                               at the time of Saint Gregory the Great on land belonging to Saint Silvia,                               Saint Gregory's mother. She had donated a good piece of land to the                               Benedictine monks to build a monastery, which became glorious during                               past years.                                                                                                               346                         At  the  end  of  many  vicissitudes,  the  monastery  was  destroyed  and  the                     sanctuary  fell  into  oblivion.  In  the  first  years  of  the  twentieth  century,  Msgr.                     Joseph Alessi, a learned, pious, famous man, succeeded to build a new sanctuary,                     and had the faithful practice again the devotion to Our Lady of Vena. Actually,                     the sanctuary is visited by many pilgrims, and is also officiated as a parish.                          The Father had opened a house in Giardini for the Daughters of Divine Zeal,                     not far from Piedimonte. They faced stormy obstacles, oppositions, and fights.                     The  case  of  closing  the  house  was  taken  into  consideration.  After  the  Father                     made the vow of introducing the devotion to Our Lady of Vena in the church of                     the community, the sisters overcame the difficulties and lived in peace. Then the                     Father erected a new altar in the church, commissioned a replica of Our Lady of                     Vena's picture from the painter Teresa Basile of Taranto, and placed it on the                     altar.                          The  inauguration  occurred  on  December  15,  1916,  after  a  triduo  of                     preparation preached by the Father. On that occasion,","the faithful were given the prayer book of Our Lady of Vena.                          Writes the Father from Altamura, « On December 15, octave of Immaculate,                     we have inaugurated in Giardini an oil painting of Our Lady of Vena. May she be                     the source of new graces, thanksgiving, and new praises! » (Vol. 34, page 110).                          After the second world war, the church has been rebuilt. But, superficiality                     and unconsciousness prevailed over the Father's vow: the altar was eliminated,                     and the oil painting was sold to an individual !                        14. Our Lady of Guard                         Besides the renown sanctuary standing out over Marseilles and dating back to                     1214, several sanctuaries in Italy are dedicated to Our Lady of Guard. Most of                     them in                              the province of Genoa or in the near vicinity, such as Tortona, where                     Don Orione has built a new one. Directly or indirectly, they are related to the           347                     sanctuary of Mount Figogna (Genoa), which was erected after the apparition of                     the Virgin to Benedict Paredo on August 29, 1490. To signal the movements of                     the troops, in the time of the Romans there was a guard post over there, and the                     church built up on the side of it after the request of the most holy Virgin was                     named Our Lady of Guard. Benedict XV defined that church « Chief sanctuary                     of Liguria » (I mille santuari mariani d7talia, page 228).                          The Father loved this title in relation to an apparition of the Madonna near                     the  torrent  running  between  the  villages  Pace  and  Saint  Agata.  Climbing  the                     torrent  on  the  right  side,  not  far  from  the  beach,  people  met  a  little  church                     dedicated  to  Our  Lady  of  the  Ladder,  and  nearby  the  Azzarello  tower,  a  post                     guard against the pirates infesting the area. On February 2, 1554, the guards fell                     asleep,  and  the  pirates  landed  undisturbed  to  attack  the  village  Faro.  But,  the                     Madonna awoke the peasant John Dominic Sieri, who sounded the alarm, and the                     pirates were driven back into the sea. (5)                          From then on, both Our Lady of Scala and the torrent were given the name of                     « Guard. » The church was officiated on","Sundays  and  holidays  until  the  end  of  the  nineteenth  century,  when  the  new                     owner demolished the church and the tower, planted a vineyard, and built a villa.                          When the Father bought country land in 1920 to relieve his communities, he                     revived the worship to Our Lady of Guard by building and dedicating a church to                     her. When the faithful climbed in procession along the torrent, carrying the statue                     bought by the Father, they found him in front of the church, wearing surplice and                     stole. He blessed the statue, said the mass, and spoke of the Madonna in his own                     style. It happened on April 25, 1924, second Sunday after Easter. (6)                          The Father spent his last days here, at the Madonna's feet, and transferred to                     heaven on June 1, 1927.                        15. Our Lady of Rogation                           0 ur       Lady  of  Rogation  »  and  «  Our  Lady  of  Divine  Zeal  »  are  private                                  titles that the Father proposed to the community.                            348                                  Before proposing a title to the faithful's devotion, the title needs the                     Church's approval (Can. 1259-1261 - Code of 1918). The above titles were never                     submitted  for  approval,  but  the  Father  hoped  that  one  day  it  would  be  done,                     because  these  titles  illumine  the  Madonna's  mission  about  the  Rogate,  and  as                     such the Madonna is our Mother... For this reason he wrote for the Rogationists,                     « As  much as I can, I will spread the devotion to the  most holy  Virgin Mary                     under any title, Our Lady of the Evangelical Rogation by the Heart of Jesus and                     Our  Lady  of  Divine  Zeal  included,  when  they  are  approved  »  (Vol.  44,  page                     133).                          To be approved, a title must be based on theological ground. As to Our Lady                     of  Rogation,  Father  Cecca  did  a  notable  work,  which  should  be  mastered  to                     become worthy of such a purpose. We quote the conclusion of the study:","After examining the value of Jesus' command, « Rogate ergo... » we have                     realized how Di Francia made it the banner of his mission to increase priestly                     vocations. We have also realized that Mary is a Rogationist model, since through                     her prayer she obtained the Redeemer and cooperated with him for the salvation                     of  souls,  becoming  universal  Mother  and  Queen.  Since  vocation  is  a  call  to                     become  an  apostle,  who  must  bring  Christ's  redemption  to  humankind,  Di                     Francia  concludes  that  Mary  has  always  been  and  still  is  concerned  with  the                     apostles. In Fact, they are the continuers of her mission of co-redeemer; and as                     coredeemer, it is within her power to obtain the increase of the apostles.                         Owing to these prerogatives, Di Francia gives the Madonna the title « Our                     Lady of Rogation. » And we invoke her as such together with him:                             Mother, whom a thousand titles                            Proclaim Lady,                            Adorning thy sweet name                            With grace and splendor.                            Perhaps, it is not the last gem                            Decking with flowers your diadem                            If we are ready                            To call you « The mystical Harvest's owner )>                                               (Bulletin, March-April 1966, page 216).                                                                                                               349                      Notes                      (1) We point out two theses on the Father's Mariology:                            a.  Our  Lady  of  Rogation,  by  Father  John  Cecca  for  his  specialization  at                        Marianum, Theological Faculty, Rome.                            b.  The  Madonna  in  Hannibal  Mary  Di  Francia's  writing  and  works,  by  Louis                        Alessandra' for his doctorate in theology at the Pontifical University Saint thomas                        Aquinas, Rome.                      (2) Saint Bernardine expressed this opinion, saying that the Madonna asked her divine                        Son to take her to heaven on Ascension day. To Comfort her, Jesus answered, « My                        sweetest  mother,  the  little  flock  of  your  children  cannot  be  deprived  of  your                        company now. They have to win for me many peoples, who will be born of your                        charity.  Therefore,  mother,  bear  with  patience  your  staying  with  them  for  some                        time... I leave you to the little flock of the beloved children as a consoling mother                        and  teacher.  Once  more,  I  entrust  you  to  them  as  a  motherly  Queen  and  Lady  »                        (Pilla, Saint Bernardine of Siena, page 215 - Encyclopedia of the saints, Editrice                        Cantagalli, Siena, 1970). '                      (3) The Father took advantage of any occasion to honor the Madonna. One time, he was                        visiting a little church dedicated to Our Lady of Pillar, a devotion","from Spain. According to a pious tradition, when still living, the Madonna appeared on                        a  pillar  to  Saint  James  the  apostle,  asking  him  to  build  a  temple  in  the  place  of  the                        apparition. The faithful had no prayers to invoke Our Lady under that title. Therefore,                        he  quickly  wrote  a  novena  of  prayers  and  verses,  adding  this  note,  «  I  wrote  these                        prayers and verses in the sacristy of Our Lady of Pillar, Saint Pier Niceto, near the river,                        on  May  9,  1904  »  (Vol.  7,  page  70).  The  building  was  destroyed  by  the  1908                        earthquake.                      (4) At Saint Mary of the Angels, in Messina, there is a beautiful sanctuary dedicated to Our                        Lady of  Lourdes with a replica of the Lourdes grotto, and is officiated by the Friars                        Minor. They claim that the introduction of this devotion in Messina is due to the renown                        Friar Minor Father Bernard of Jesus. He introduced the devotion in 1875 at Saint Mary                        of Porto Salvo. In 1898 such a devotion was introduced as Saint Mary of the Angels,                        where Father Bernard had prepared an artistic grotto with the statues of the Madonna                        and Saint Bernardette (La Scintilla, August 23, 1970, page 3).                            Despite the above affirmation, the first public manifestation of the devotion to Our                        Lady of Lourdes promoted by the Franciscans occurred in 1898.                            The  Father  stated  that  he  was  the  first  to  introduce  the  devotion  to  Our  Lady  of                        Lourdes in Messina. When Father Silvester Di Bella gave him a manual of prayers for                        the devotees of Our Lady of Lourdes, which was published by the Friars Minor at Saint                        Mary of the Angels, the Father looked at it. Then he said: « They made a mistake in                        history. The devotion to Our Lady of Lourdes has been introduced in Saint Laurence     350                        parish in May, 1876. »                                The point is: what does it mean introducing a devotion to the Madonna ?                            Obviously, the first news of the Madonna's apparitions was not brought to Messina                        by Father Bernard in 1875. Such news spread all over the world earlier. The preachers                        of the Marian triduos and novenas surely spoke of it, as they do now for Our Lady of                        Fatima and Syracuse. Father Bernard probably spoke and preached it before 1875. The                        Father was spreading this devotion when he was fifteen years old.                            The  columnist  binds  the  beginning  of  the  devotion  to  Our  Lady  of  Lourdes  in                        Messina to Father Bernard, when he came back from a pilgrimage to Lourdes. But, he                        gives no proofs to substantiate his assertion. On the contrary, the proofs abound in favor                        of our Father and Saint Laurence's, as we see from the following:                            a. In 1876, as a subdeacon, the Father preached the whole month of May in Saint                        Laurence parish. He related and explained the 18 apparitions of Our Lady at Lourdes.                            b. At the end of May, he erected the Pious Association of the Madonna under the                        title of Lourdes, which was soon associated with the primary archbrotherhood in Rome.                            c. In July of the same year, the Father published a booklet for the association, giving                        an account of the apparitions and adding prayers and verses, which soon became very                        popular. Writes Father Vitale, « Our Father wrote verses in devotion to Our Lady of                        Lourdes which were and still are sung in the churches of the diocese. The words are                        sung in the churches and even sometimes in the streets by pious little girls:","Shout with joy louder than the bell                            Praised be the Virgin of Massabielle ! »                                           (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 31).                         In this booklet the Father states: « This dear devotion today is practiced in our city. It                     originated from the preaching on the apparitions of Lourdes in Saint Laurence parish, in                     1876.                         d. Institution of the Saturdays in honor of Our Lady of Lourdes. On every Saturday of                     the year, June to April, a special liturgy was performed with prayers, songs, and preaching                     on Our Lady of Lourdes. For three years in succession, beginning from 1876, the preacher                     was the Father. Outlines of more than a hundred sermons by the Father on the Madonna end                     by recalling the apparitions of Our Lady at Lourdes, or a miracle of her over there.                         e. On December 2, 1876, Saturday, the Father points out the increase of this devotion in                     the city. « Born as by magic in the Marian month, it is just seven months since this devotion                     has been introduced, and now it has spread all over the city. Contrary to other devotions                     which needed much time to develop, this one, as soon as it appeared, spread quickly in the                     city, winning the hearts of all. By benignly choosing this parish, Our Lady of Lourdes is                     calling the inhabitants of opposite quarters to come over here at her feet. Many of them                     have joined the Congregation of Immaculate Conception of Lourdes, which number 4000                     associates, who are paying the monthly sum of five soldos. The amount of money helps to                     maintain  the  devotion  by  celebrating  the  monthly  Saturdays,  by  adorning  the  altar,  by                     celebrating the yearly feast, and the preaching of the Marian month. It also gives additional                     advantages, such as the funerals, etc. Therefore, we conclude that the devotion to Our Lady                     of Lourdes is already established in Messina, and it is improving quickly » (Vol. 17, page                     26).                                                                                      351                         f  The  faithful  established  to  celebrate  the  feast  of  Our  Lady  of  Lourdes  in  Saint                     Laurence's on the second Sunday of June. The Catholic Word of June 12, 1878, reports that                     in 1878 « Father Francis Pulito preached the triduo, and Father Hannibal Di Francia said the                     panegyric in the presence of Archbishop Guarino. »                         g.  In the early days of the devotion, the faithful prayed before an oil painting of the                     Madonna, but the Father suggested to buy a statue. Joseph Prinzi, a valiant artist who had                     won the competition for sculpturing the statue of Saint William (it is now in Saint Peter's                     among the holy founders), was entrusted with this sculpturing. His very beautiful statue was                     inaugurated on December 29, 1877, Saturday, by a speech of the Father.                         h. We add another proof. The Catholic Word was the only Catholic periodical of the city                     in those times, and it never touches upon the devotion of Our Lady of Lourdes outside Saint                     Laurence's,  even  though  it  reports  the  liturgies  performed  in  the  other  churches.  The                     Catholic Word of July 18, 1883, reporting the 25th anniversary of the apparitions, says, «                     The 25th anniversary of the apparitions of the most holy Virgin at Lourdes was celebrated                     solemnly in Saint Laurence parish. The triduo by eminent preachers was on twelve, thirteen,                     and fourteen. On Sunday fifteen, eve of the last apparition, the solemn mass with preaching                     was crowded by the faithful who communicated the bread of angels. The solemn canonical                     mass  was  at  10:30,  and  the  panegyric  by  Canon  Di  Francia,  in  the  evening.  The  great                     devout concourse of people was satisfying, and the high altar was adorned with good taste.                     » We find no mention of similar liturgies in other churches in Messina.                         On April 18, 1892, to foster the enthusiasm of the associates of the Pious Union, which                     was growing feeble, « as it happens to human weakness which","does not keep the original fervor, » the Father preached again in Saint Laurence's                        (Vol. 19, page 169). In such exhortation there is no mention of similar devotion in                        other  churches.  The  Pious  Union  collected  itself  and  kept  active  until  the  1908                        earthquake. After the catastrophe, the Carmelite Fathers who were entrusted with                        Saint Laurence's enhanced the devotion to Our Lady of Carmel, and the devotion to                        Our Lady of Lourdes remained in the hands of the Friars Minor.                      (5) The fact has been described in detail by the historian Father Samperi, S.J., in his                        Iconologia Mariana, L. V. ch. 3.

All of us form one family                               The Second Vatican Council has reduced the number and the rite of several                     feasts of saints.                          \"Lest  the feasts of the saints should take precedence  over the  feasts  which                     commemorate the very mysteries  of  salvation, many  of  them should be left to                     be celebrated  by  a  particular Church,  or nation,  or family of religious. Only                     those  should  be  extended  to  the  universal  Church  which  commemorate  saints                     who are truly of universal importance\" (S.C. no. lll). (l)                          This  reduction  was  wrongly  interpreted by  quite  a  few persons   as  a                     retraction  or  indirect  condemnation  of   the veneration toward the saints.                          Complaining for the faithful's almost general indifference to the celebration of                     the saints, Don Barsotti writes,                          \"If  they  really  believe  in  the  love  for  neighbor,  why  don't  they  feel  the                     communion of the saints?  Why does love for the saints seem to fail in today's                     Church? If they are bound to love their neighbor, who is more neighbor than the                     saints in heaven? People cannot say  that the saints upset  our union with God.                     Because we live as in a family, why should the presence of the saints upset us?                     We live and breathe the same atmosphere of light, serenity, joy, and love. We are         354                     with them, and they with us.\"                          This issue, however, has been solved by the Council.                          \"Let  the  faithful be taught that our communion with  these (the  saints) in                     heaven,  provided that it is understood  in  the full  light  of  faith,  in  no way                     diminishes  the  worship  of adoration  given  to God the Father...  it greatly                     enriches  it\" (L.G. 5l). Don Barsotti reports the example of Saint Theresa. \"We                     could think of this great mystic as living enraptured in God and oblivious of the                     saints. On the contrary, perhaps no saint in the Church was so devout to Saint                     Joseph, the Apostles Peter and Paul, and other saints, (2) as Theresa. Thus, she                     lived a life of love, feeling herself a sister to all.\"","Recalling a personal episode tied to Saint Tolentino's feast, Don Barsotti writes,                     \"Who was this saint I had to honor, who was willing to enter my life? Who was                     this unknown saint, who loved me and showed up in the whole Church that day,                     for me?\"  But the saint made himself felt.  \"At  the  end  of  my meditation on                     this saint,  who was as fallen down from heaven,  I realized that I had his picture                     in my hand, as in confirmation of his knowledge, care, and love  for me, even                     though I did not know him\" (Divo Barsotti,  Nella Comunione dei Santi, Vita e                     Pensiero, Introduzione, passim).                          A thought of Celina, a sister of Saint Theresa of the child Jesus,   comes in                     handy.   \"As a sponge soaked with   water communicates its liquid when it is                     handled, so a saint shares the divine grace when he is approached by people. For                     this reason the saints are very beneficial to the Church” (Piat, Celina - Editrice                     Ancora, page 69).                          Let    us    quote    again  the  Council  about  the    feasts    of    the  saints    which                     \"proclaim  the wonderful works of  Christ  in  his servants  and  offer to the                     faithful fitting examples  for  their imitation\" (S.C.  lll).  Lumen Gentium devotes                     the number 49, 50, and  5l  to  the  veneration  of  the  saints,   vindicating  its                     legitimacy,    defining  its  nature,    and  specifying  its  advantages.  The  Council                     \"accepts  loyally...and  proposes  again  the  decrees    of  the  Second  Council  of                     Nicea,  of the Council of Florence,  and of the  Council  of  Trent\" on \"the living                     communion   which  exists between  us and our brothers who are in the glory  of           355                     heaven;...  urges  all  concerned  to  remove  or  correct  any  abuses,    excesses  or                     defects  which may have crept in here and there,\" and teaches the authentic  cult                     of the saints (5l).  The saints \"do not cease to intercede with the Father for us...so                     by their brotherly concern is our weakness greatly helped\" (49).  By looking on                     the life of the saints, “we are taught to know a most safe path by which, despite                     the vicissitudes of the world, and in keeping with the state of life and condition                     proper to each of us, we will be able to arrive at perfect union with Christ, that is,                     holiness.  God shows  to men,  in a vivid way,  his presence and his face in the                     lives    of    those    companions    of    ours;...He    speaks    to    us      in  them...Our                     community with the saints joins us to Christ...  It is most fitting,  therefore, that                     we love those friends and co-heirs of  Jesus  Christ  who  are also  our  brothers                     and    outstanding  benefactors,    and  that  we  give  due  thanks  to  God  for  them,                     humbly invoking  them,  and having recourse to their prayers,  their aid and help                     in obtaining from God...the benefits we need\" (50).  Let us remember that \"all of                     us are sons of God and form one family in Christ\" (5l).","Living this sublime teaching in faith, we should remember enthusiastically and                     fervently All Saints’ preface, “Today we keep the festival of your holy city, the                     heavenly Jerusalem, our mother.  Around your throne the saints, our brothers and                     sisters,  sing  your  praise  for  ever.    Their  glory  fills  us  with    joy,    and  their                     communion  with  us  in  your Church gives   inspiration  and strength,  as  we                     hasten on our pilgrimage of faith, eager to meet them.\"                        2. Everything from Jesus’ love                              What  has  been  said  above  explains  marvelously  the  Father’s  very  vivid                     devotion to the angels and the saints.  He wrote, \"The saints live in the Church's                     children’s hearts, affections, and thoughts. They live in the faith, expectation, and                     love of those who feel themselves needy of an everlasting happiness (Vol.  45,                     page 56l).                          This is the Father's spirit.  He lived the communion of the saints, holding them                     as  friends  and  brothers,  saying,  \"I  have  a  few  friends  on  earth,  but  many  in                     heaven.\"                          Such devotion sprang from love of Jesus.  \"In Jesus  and through his divine          356                     love, we have to nourish all holy loves in our hearts,  such  as:  love  for the most                     holy  Virgin  Mary...  the Patriarch  Saint Joseph...the dearest angels and saints                     of  God, and  the choice spirits whose company we hope to enjoy for  ever\" (Vol.                     3, page l66).                          Since his early youth, “the Father delighted in reading the lives of the saints\"                     (Vol.  45, page 552), imitating their examples and invoking them for himself and                     for his institutions. He  loved  all saints,  and wrote so many prayer  pamphlets                     with piety  and unction,  with hymns to Jesus,  the Madonna,  and  the saints.                     You can hardly find a church in the city of Messina, or in its villages, having no                     booklet of prayers, or special, or traditional devotions written by him.  People                     appealed to him, because he was endowed with the gift of understanding the feast                     and the soul of the faithful.","For the Rogationist he wrote,                          \"The Rogationists will foster devotion to the saints, giving the   preference to                     the  ones  who  are  nearest  to  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  and  the  most  holy  Virgin.                     Because  the  Rogationist institute's  aim  is obedience to the command  of  Jesus,                     'Pray,  therefore...',  the  congregants  will  be  particularly  devout  to  the  apostle                     saints,  especially Peter, Paul, and the evangelist John, saying a specific prayer to                     each of them on their feast\" (Vol. 3, page l8).                               His personal devotion to the saints was Catholic, that is to say, universal.                     Father Palumbo, who has been a teacher for  a few years in our schools in Oria,                     defined our Father very  concisely and  aptly,  \"The Father never left out a saint                     without a prayer, as  he never left out a beggar without a help>\"  Even  though                     he had  priorities and limits in his devotions,  he never denied his respect to a                     saint when the opportunity occurred. For this reason he wrote so many verses to                     the saints either spontaneously or by request, even when the saints were almost                     unknown. Several times, his verses implement a prayer book or petitions of his                     own.                          Let  us  quote  his  work  on  the  saints,    without    chronological  order:    Saint                     Leonard,    abbot;  Saint  Marina,  Saint  Pancras,  Saint  Ignatius  martyr,    Saint                     Bernard,  Saint Barsanuphius, Saint Peter of  Alcantara,  Saint Fara,  Saint Lucy,                     Saint Francis of Paola, Saint Camillus de Lellis,  Saint Gertrude,  Saint  Julia,                     Saint  Liberatus,  Saint    Margaret  Alacoque,    Saint  Rita,    Saint    Orsola,  Saint                     Laurence,  Saint Pantaleon,  Saint Stanislaus Kostka, Saint Louis Gonzaga,  Saint         357                     Bonaventure, Saint John of the Cross, Saint Theresa,   Saint Francis of Assisi,                     Saint Francis of Sales, Saint Euplius  deacon and martyr,  Saint Vincent of Paul,                     Saint    Anna,  Saint  Alphius,    Saint  Philadelphus,    Saint  Cyril,    Saint  Dorothy,                     Saint  Louis M.  Grignion of Monfort,  Saint Melanie  Jr.,  Saint Lydwina,   Saint                     Dominica,  Saint  Hugh,  abbot;  Saint  Vincent Ferreri,  Saint  John Bosco...  all                     the  angels  and  the    saints...  Wonderful    is  the  end  of  his  hymn  to  all  saints.                     Paradise is the full triumph of the divine love.                                           Like stars vying                                           With one another for beauty,                                           The angels shine                                          Along with the saints.                                          In the midst of the glory                                           Of so much purity                                          One and manifold                                          Love gains!                           Let us make some remarks.","Saint Francis of Paola was the saint of Di Francia family. For that reason our                     founder's father was given the name of Francis Paul.  His last son, born after his                     death, was also given the same name. He became a priest.                             Saint Francis of Assisi and Saint Joseph Benedict Labre enraptured the                     Father with their evangelical poverty. There was a time when the Father had the                     idea of making the sisters of his institute Franciscan tertiary.  In fact, he exhorts                     the first novices to nourish the devotion to \"the glorious Saint Francis of Assisi,                     model of evangelical poverty, in the hope of becoming tertiaries\" (Vol. 2, page                     3l). But we have already seen that love for Our Lady of Carmel and the urgency                     to keep the Rogate independent prevailed over this idea.                          In l9l5, the Father wrote a private novena and a petition to Saint  Teresa,  who                     still was a Servant of God,  proclaiming  her \"special  patron  and  sister  of  the                     least  community  of  the Daughters of Divine Zeal\" (Vol.  8, page 50).  One                     night in his last sickness, a couple of months before his demise, he sent for me.                     He was weary> He told me, \"Pick up Saint Teresa's picture.\" I took it from his                     study room and held it before his eyes.  He prayed, “My dear little sister, give me                     one of your roses.\"  He asked the grace of sleeping for half an hour.  He had just                     said the last word, when he fell asleep calm for about an hour.  The little saint                     had granted his request.                          Let us now go into the details of his devotion to the angels and the saints.                                                                                                                358                       3. Devotion to the angels                            As to the Father's devotion to the angels, we point out that he perhaps wrote no                     prayer  without  mentioning  them,  at  least  Saint  Michael  the  archangel.    He                     exhorted us to be devout to the angels of the different spheres, and to those who                     take care of the place where our communities dwell.","The  pictures  we draw by lot at the beginning of  the  year which  indicate  the                     virtue and the penance we have  to  practice have the name of an angel,  or more                     than one, or a choir of them. They are meant to be the particular patrons of the                     persons who draw the pictures.                          The names of the angels are very few:  three.  However, we know their choirs                     and  the  angels  mentioned  by  the  Scripture,  such  as  the  angel  who  comforted                     Jesus  in  the  garden,  the  one  who  freed  Peter  from  jail,  the  one  who  stopped                     Abraham's  hand,  etc.    When  other  angels  were  needed  in  the  drawing  of  the                     pictures, we resorted to the guardian angel of Saint Joseph, or Saint Anthony of                     Padua, or Saint Louis, etc.                          Saint  Michael  was  the  patron  of  our  communities.    The  Father  wanted  our                     communities to have his statue, and in each evening of May they had a reading                     about the glorious archangel.                          The Father proclaimed Saint Michael patron of the institute, and interpreted a                     simple  episode  as  the  confirmation  that  our  Lord  had  welcomed  such  a                     proclamation.  The episode is the following:                          The  Father  told  us that while he  was  remembering  God's promise  to  the                     people of Israel,  \"See,  I am sending an  angel before you,  to guard you on the                     way and bring you to the place I have prepared\" (Ex.  23, 20), he himself wished                     to have an angel as guardian and guide of the institute.  Therefore he made a                     petition to the Lord.  In the simplicity of his faith, he thought that the Lord had       359                     granted him the favor, even though he perceived no external signal.  A few days                     after,  a  letter  by  Msgr.    Gatti,  director  of  Mount  Saint  Angel,  was  delivered.                     Msgr.  Gatti informed  the Father that he was adhering to the Sacred  Alliance                     and   exhorted  the  founder  to  put  his  institute  under  the protection  of the                     great archangel,  who would guide and  make  it prosper. \"Here is the answer                     from heaven“Exclaimed the Father. \"The angel of the institute is Saint Michael                     the archangel, no less. The Lord entrusts us to his protection>\"                          He    began    fostering    the  devotion  to  Saint  Michael    in    the  institute    by                     dedicating  an altar to him in  the  sanctuary  of Messina,  and  by  ordering two                     novenas  with  his  verses    for    the  feasts    on  May  8  and  September  29.    On                     September  30,  l9l0,  he pilgrimage  with  Father Palma to Mount Saint  Angel,                     where  he presented a petition to the archangel for his communities' needs.                          As an exception, he joined Saint Michael to our Lord and Our Lady through a                     particular title in July l9l7.  After giving Jesus in the Sacrament the title \"Very                     tender companion of our","exile,\"  and  Our  Lady  \"Everlasting  helper  of  all,\"  he  continues,  “My  dear                     children,  you  are  expecting  to  give  an  analogous  title  to  the  Patriarch  Saint                     Joseph.  But, because the great Patriarch Saint Joseph loves to be hidden, as he                     always did from early Christian times, this year he makes over his rights to Saint                     Michael.  The great archangel is our great and very special patron.  Rather, he is                     the delegate of our Lord Jesus Christ, and protects the Church.  How many times                     he showed his powerful protection to us Therefore,   we   proclaim   him “The                     great deputy of   human protection.\"  And under this title he wrote the hymn to                     Saint Michael.                          The guardian angel follows Saint Michael.  To foster our devotion and to give                     us a visible sign of the guardian angel’s protection, the Father placed his statue in                     a corridor in our houses.  I remember the Father's continuous exhortations to be                     devout to the guardian angel, to which we say a special prayer every Tuesday.                     The  Father  wrote  a  booklet  on  the  guardian  angels,  gave  us  some  pendant                     medals, and exhorted each of us to honor our own guardian angel as the witness                     of our actions.                          In  chapter  l  and  2,  we have reported  that  the  Father implored  with wails                     his  conversion  and  holiness  from  his    angel.  In  a  personal  note,  he  begs  his                     guardian angel, \"Make me aware of the divine presence in order to pray, praise,                     know, obey, and to be an associate of your actions.  While you stay in the vision,                     let me be in faith\" (Vol. 44, page 97).                          He asked his guardian angel to recommend him to the guardian angels of the           360                     persons who had to meet him.                          Recommending  this  devotion  to  the  youth,  he  exhorted  them  to  be    fully                     aware of the guardian angel's presence,  to follow  his inspirations,  and  often  to                     say the  prayer  \"Angel  of  God\"; especially  when  they were in danger of body                     and  soul,  in  the calamitous times, and the times of divine punishments. We                     read in the  rules  of the first novices,  \"As a sign of respect  to  the guardian                     angel,  they will invite him to pass first through  the narrow  places,  and will kiss                     twice the ground in the night,  as though they were kissing the angel's feet\" (Vol.                     2, page 3l).                          During the l887 cholera,  the Father experienced  the  holy angels'  particular                     assistance,   and promised to write a booklet of considerations and prayers to the                     guardian angels.  The  first edition  was published in l908;  the second,  in l9l0.                     The title is,","\"The  preservation  from  divine  punishments  and  the  invocation  of    the    holy                     guardian  angels  as patrons  in  time  of  public calamities.\"                           We  also  recall  a private prayer of the  Father  to  Saint Raphael,  \"physician                     of God,\" to obtain the healing of the spirit (Ch. l, no. 2).                           The  Father recommended so much a particular  devotion.  \"He wanted  us  to                     be specially devout to the seven angels  who  are always  in the presence of God,                     above all to Saint  Michael  the archangel,  Saint Gabriel,  and Saint Raphael.\"                     He said,  \"In ch. l2,  v.  l5  of Tobit we read that the Archangel Raphael revealed                     himself to Saint Tobit and his son by saying,  \"I am Raphael, one of  the seven                     angels  who  enter  and  serve  before  the  Glory  of   the  Lord.\"  According  to  this                     revelation,  seven angels in heaven  are in the presence of God more immediately                     than the other ones. They contemplate,  enjoy,  and  are ready to do God's will.                     The seven angels have more knowledge of God's presence, are the chosen ones to                     carry out the orders of his divine majesty,  and transmit  the messages  to  angels                     and men.  Scripture reports the sublime  and expressive names of the first three                     angels;    the  other  four  names  came    to  our  knowledge  through  a  private                     revelation of a  Servant of  God  in a convent,  in ancient times.  The  seven                     names  are mysterious, having particular and admirable meanings.(3)                           Great is the power of these seven angels,  very effective is their intercession,     361                     and most beneficial their protection.  It is very  useful to invoke all of them in the                     circumstances of  life, but especially in the hour of our death. It is also beneficial                     to invoke  their  protection  in the time of divine  punishments  in order to be                     liberated.\" To achieve this goal,  the Father adds  a particular prayer (Vol. 9, page                     82).                        4. Saint Joseph                            During  the first world war the Father added three \"Glory to bes\" to the prayers                     before  and  after  meal,  respectfully    to  Saint  Joseph,  Saint  Michael,  and  Saint                     Anthony of Padua. I once invoked first  Saint  Michael,  second Saint Joseph.  He                     told me, \"The question whether Saint","Joseph is greater or  not  than  Saint Michael is useless. I place Saint Joseph soon                     after the most holy Virgin.  Since  Jesus,  Mary,  and  Joseph were always united                     on earth,  they  must  be  together in heaven.  The  glorious  Saint Michael should                     not take offense.\"                          Saint Joseph followed Jesus and Mary immediately, because he is the Father                     of providence,  the patron of the Church, the model of  interior  life,  and  the                     patron  of  the  institute.  As  he nourished and defended the child Jesus,  so he                     had to protect the least  institution  of  the Evangelical Rogation along  with  the                     orphanages.                          Di Francia family was very devout to Saint Joseph and had  a pretty  wooden                     bust of the saint,  before which the whole  family renewed its consecration to the                     saint,  every  year.    We have  many formulas written and signed by  the family                     members,  beginning  with  l876.    When  the  Father's  mother  died,  the  bust  was                     transferred to Avignone.                          To  improve his interior life,  the Father entrusted himself to Saint Joseph.                           O glorious Saint Joseph, I appeal to you, the distributor of divine treasures.  I                     wish to become a saint to belong totally  to Jesus,  to serve him in this institute as                     he  wants\"  (Vol.  4,  page  l8).    He  addresses  him,  imploring  that  the  devil  and                     nature  cheat  him  in  no  way  while  treating  his  affairs.    \"O  glorious  Patriarch,   362                     concern  yourself with it so that the affair may be according  to the  divine  will,                     for the greater consolation of the most  holy Heart of Jesus ...  O powerful saint,                     see to it that my trust in you and my appeal to your powerful protection have                     good  results! I am expecting from you the divine graces which do not gratify my                     selfishness and passions, but please the most holy Heart of Jesus and the wishes                     of his soul (Vol. 6, page l2).                           Since  the beginning,  the Father puts his institution under the  protection  of                     Saint Joseph,  invoking him  with  an  ardent prayer.                          O sublime, powerful, compassionate saint, all of us are kneeling at your feet...                     Deign  to  look  mercifully  and  benignly  at  these  places  of  extreme  misery,                     affliction, and disorder. This is the kingdom of ignorance,  nausea,  dreariness,                     abandon,  and  sin,  where  the  hellish  enemy  torments  the  bodies  and  ruins  the                     souls. We implore you with raised hands.  Come,  see,  and protect these places,                     putting    this  quarter  along  with  its  dwellers  under  your  powerful  protection.                     Shelter  the  dwellers  and  their  slums  under  your  mantle;  enlighten  so  many                     darkened minds with your","grace  and  wisdom...    have    mercy  on  the  unsafe  little  virgins,    the  feeble,                     abandoned  poor,  and the dispersed children who are  growing  in stench and                     abandon. Deign to protect the works of charity started in  this place,  helping                     them grow as buds of the most holy Heart of Jesus.  Make new works of charity                     rise in order to shelter the abandoned children and to keep the souls away from                     ignorance  and sin (Vol. 8, page l2).                           He  called  the  little  house  of  the  first  four  sisters,  Little  Retreat  of  Saint                     Joseph,  and entrusted the seed of the  nascent congregation to the saint.                           \"I entrust these four souls to  your fatherly charity;  deign to  sanctify  and                     make them apt to fulfill the divine  plan...  O glorious saint,  I beseech you to                     make  their  will  sincere,    their  purpose  firm,    their  intention  wise,    their  wish                     fervent,  their behavior  holy,   and  their  devotion  perseverant.\"  Then,   he                     concludes,  \"If  some  of  these persons are not  called  to  the religious  state,                     you see to it that only those whom God deigned to call to the religious profession                     dwell in this Little Retreat, consecrated to you\" (Vol. 4, page 23).                           The  sisters  took  the  garb  and  the  vows  on  March  l9.  When  the  male                     community  began  taking  the  garb  and  the  vows,  they  also  were  under    the                     protection  of the saint.  But  to  have  the  Father available  (he  was  busy with                     the sisters on  March  l9),  their liturgy  was  set  on the  saint's  patronage  feast,    363                     which  was celebrated on the third Wednesday or Sunday after Easter.                          The  feast of the saint was preceded by a devotion on  seven Wednesdays and                     a solemn novena.  Before renewing their vows,  the Rogationists said the novena                     of the saint's patronage, prayers to the most holy Heart of Jesus, to the most holy                     Virgin  Immaculate,  and    to  the  saint.    Then  the  community  listened  to  the                     preaching,  or    meditated      on    the    religious    state.    Usually,    the    Father                     commented  enthusiastically some passage from Paradise on  earth, by Father                     Natale, S. J., making practical applications. Today the book  is out of fashion,                     but it confirmed many vocations in  the old days.                          To  implore  the  saint's  help on  the  institute  and  its members, the Father                     wrote  seven  strophes,  which  the  orphans  sang,  one  a  day,  while  working.  We                     quote one of them:                                          Buy this place                                           And grant us the virtue.                                          Drive away the devil,                                          Keeping us sound and safe.                                          O saint, please implant                                          This little plant.","As  to  the  interior  life  of  the  community,  the  Father  counted  on  the  saint,    to                     whom he wrote a prayer (Vol.  4,  page 8).  The      community  said it every day                     in  March.    He  also  appealed    to    the  saint    for  holy  vocations,    lighted  the                     vocation lamp before  his statue,  and  often  mentioned it in the hymns to  Saint                     Joseph, beginning with July first l905.(4)                      O saint, see the little flame                                          Before you by night and by day,                                          Burning and praying in its frame                                          The elect and the saint to display (l905).                                           If the lamp burning around                                          Begs the elect for our ground,                                          Co-founder, hear our case,                                          And grant us your grace! (l906)                                           The burning light                                          Shining day and night,                                          Isn't the aerial bell                                          Calling others to its dwell?                                          ............                                          From cities, and unknown villages                                    364                                          Call the children God privileges,                                          Innocent, pure, and sincere                                          As should be those of our sphere... (l9l4)                           In  the institute's early days,  when Saint Anthony's  bread devotion  was  not                     yet born,  the celestial purveyor  was  Saint Joseph,  to whom the Father appealed                     in his needs.  We recall an episode  of  those  times.  The  baker had sued  the                     Father  for arrears.  When the judge asked the Father who was his lawyer,  he                     pulled    a  picture  of  Saint  Joseph  out  of  his    pocket,    and    said,  \"This  is  my                     lawyer.  What can I do?  I have,  and I will pay when Saint Joseph gives me the                     means. I beg my creditor to take things with  a good deal of patience...\" At these                     words,  the  creditor, whose name was Present,  came out saying,  \"Once again                     you say 'I have,  and  I  will pay;  be patient.' And once again I  will  be patient...\"                     The hearing was closed.                          In  l9ll,  an  apostolic  visitor  came  to  our  institute. Inaugurating  a statue of                     Saint Joseph at  Taormina,  the  Father","proclaimed the saint 'Visitor':                                           We exult with great joy,                                          Sisters and Daughters of the Sacred Heart;                                          We hear the echo of a pious decoy:                                          Joseph the Visitor has come to our hearth...                           The   petitions   he addressed  to  Saint  Joseph  in   any circumstance were                     continuous.  Let us read a report, \"The saint's bust in the chapel seemed to be a                     post-man,    full  as  it  was    with  envelopes    and  keys.      Every  time  the  Father                     bought the  Avignone slums, he entrusted the saint with the houses' keys, as a                     sign of the saint's ownership.\" Unfortunately,  in l9l9,  the church took fire and                     the  statue  was  lost  along  with  the  petitions.    They  were  a  good  piece  of  the                     institute's story!                          The Father sums up Saint Joseph's work in the institute:                             The holy Patriarch held it since its beginning as though  it was  entrusted                     to him by the most holy Heart of Jesus and by  his divine  spouse  Mary.  The                     little plant was entrusted  to  Saint Joseph,  who  protected  it lovingly amidst the                     clouds  and  the storms.  When the soil around was dry,  he laid on it the morning                     dew.  When  the sun was about to wither it,  he covered the plant with his mantle.                     When a passenger was trampling on, or rooting it out,  he defended it.  When                     animals threatened with devouring it, he  drove  them away into the abyss.  When          365                     the    torrents    rushed  headlong  down  the  plant,  he  built  up  embankments.  He                     made it grow according  to Jesus' and Mary's wish by strengthening its  roots,                     stretching out its branches, and bringing its fruits to maturity. Finally, he said to                     the angel of Padua, “Anthony, I appoint you as a distributor of my providence to                     this pious institution for the interests of Jesus' Heart! (S.C. Vol. 3, page 270).                          Somewhere else the Father touches again upon the  same subject.  \"We are                     intimately convinced that Saint Joseph won  for us Saint Anthony's protection.                     Rather, we think that Saint Joseph himself, as the universal patron of the Church,                     gave the devotion of  Saint  Anthony's bread to the peoples of these last times  to                     console any class of persons\" (Ibid. page 249).                          The Daughters of the Sacred Side testify beautifully, “He was so fond of Saint                     Joseph! He wrote to us to put our communities under the protection of the saint.                     He celebrated, and made people celebrate his feast with a novena and a dinner                     for  the  poor,  where  it  was  feasible.\"  \"He  instilled  this  devotion  to  us,  who                     wereneeding the Father's help and were in the condition to better appreciate his                     precious  trust  in  the  holy  Patriarch.\"  Mother  Quaranta  bears  the  following                     witness, \"I still have to say of his","great devotion and trust in Saint Joseph.  He exhorted  us to  have  a  tender,                     simple,  ingenuous  devotion  to  the  holy Patriarch.  According  to his way of                     thinking,  when in need,  we should  pray  to  the saint heartily  and  insistently,                     even  by threatening him with taking away the child Jesus, or covering him with                     paper,  until he helps us.  The Servant of God wanted us to eat bread of wheat (it                     was around l9l3); wheat came in.  He also wanted us to eat fruit every day, and                     even though we had no money to buy it, fruit never failed. Sometimes, oil for                     Saint Joseph's lamp was lacking. Prayed or threatened, Saint Joseph helped us.\"                           Mother Quaranta related the above evidences many times to me in detail, and                     I quote them.                          The Father saw the sisters eating uneatable bread, and said, \"Daughters, bread                     is o be of pure wheat,  otherwise  you  are unable to work.\"                          \"Who gives us such bread?\"                          \"Ask Saint Joseph for it; rather, you place an empty open sack under Saint                     Joseph's picture, and he will provide you.\"                          We did so.  Because the building was poor, and one room served as a parlor,                     laboratory, and refectory, whoever came in saw the empty open sack under Saint                     Joseph's picture.  In those days, the doctor happened to pass by, and smiled at the                     singular expedient.  The fact is that a rich man left a big gold coin, \"such as, said                     Mother Quaranta, we ever saw. As the rich man went out, a lady came in to offer                     some wheat!\" Thus, Saint Joseph answered the Father's trust, and the doctor felt          366                     himself drawn to a greater devotion to the saint, when he knew these happenings.                        5. Saint Anthony of Padua                          After Saint Joseph, Saint Anthony.                           Listen to the Father speaking of his own devout, thankful heart toward Saint                     Anthony.    In  l9l8,    after  announcing  the    new  titles  of  July  first,    \"The  great                     treasure hidden in the Church's field\"  for  our  Lord,  and \"Always","open revenue of  the  divine treasures\" for the most holy Virgin,  he addresses                     \"the  glorious Thaumaturge  Saint  Anthony  of  Padua,  our  very  singular  and                     untiring    benefactor,    and  benefactor  of  those  who  appeal  to    our  humble                     prayers.\" And he gives the motivation:                           Dearest  children,  I see your joy  for the homage that  our communities  will                     pay  to a saint who is a dearest  and  beloved comforter of all.  He is a saint of                     the world, but for us, he is something more.  I am unable to express it, because                     the  existence  of    our    institute  and    its  liberation  from    the    troubles    which                     involved    it    in    a    labyrinth,    are  due  to  his    merits    and    his  powerful                     intercession  near the most holy Hearts  of  Jesus  and Mary,  and  the  great                     Patriarch Saint Joseph.  When  we  didn't think  of  him,  he  put  us out to  sea,                     always  improving  the institute  by  giving  spiritual and  temporal  help,  great                     and unexpected graces, and lasting stability to our houses.                          Dearest   children,   because   I  endured  the  burden   of exceptional  want                     and fruitless labors for many  years,  I  feel greatly thankful to our beloved and                     sweetest saint. You too ought to feel it.  Therefore, this year we are drawn to pay                     our homage to him by proclaiming the sublime Saint Anthony of Padua “Great                     Universal Benefactor.\" By so doing,  we do our duty,  and  please the  most  holy                     Hearts of Jesus and Mary,  the  Patriarch  Saint Joseph,  as  well as the angels and                     the saints our patrons  (Vol. 34, page l33).                                                                                                               367                          Saint   Anthony   entered the institute’s history as   a celestial benefactor.  The                     devotion to Saint Anthony of Padua was unknown to Di Francia family.  Saint                     Francis of Paola instead stood out in Messina for his unforgettable crossing of                     the strait and his landing at Ringo.                          Saint Anthony was chiefly invoked by people for recovering lost things.  The                     Father did so the first time he invoked the saint.  He recovered his shoes' silver                     buckles  and  a  precious  manuscript  of  prayers.    In  both  cases  the  saint’s                     intervention  seemed  prodigious  to  the  Father,  who  made  the  report  to  the                     periodical of Padua The Saint of the Miracles.  His report was in the issue of                     April l, l890 (S.C.  Vol.  l, page 65). Because the Father calls Saint Anthony \"my                     glorious saint,\" we think that Saint Anthony was already a patron of the Father.                          Another   episode dates back to the beginning of   the institution, when the                     Father  was  in  need  of  a  thousand  liras.  He  went  to  pray  to  the  Immaculate's                     church, in Saint Anthony's room. Out of the church, he met Canon Ardoino, who                     asked the Father, \"What's the matter, Canon? You seem worried.\"                          \"I have an urgent need of a thousand liras!\"","\"Here they are!\"                           The saint's predilection for the institute showed up in the l887 cholera. The                     Father himself narrates the event.                           \"As  the  cholera  raged  in  Messina  in  l887,  the  widow  Susanna  Consiglio                     Miceli,  a pious, wealthy woman, vowed to Saint Anthony that she would give                     sixty  liras  for  bread  for  the  male  orphans  of  Saint  Anthony  of  Padua.    She                     pledged  her  donation  in  honor  of  the  saint,  providing  he  spared  her  and  her                     family from the disease...                      After the cholera had ceased, a young man - her Servant Letterio Curro’ of Torre                     Faro - came to me...and gave me \"sixty liras to buy bread for the orphans of Saint                     Anthony of Padua.\"  (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 95).                           The devotion to Saint Anthony's bread for the poor started in Tolone three                     years later, in l890.  The Father was interested in remarking the precedence as a                     predilection  of  the  saint  for  the  pious  institute.    Therefore,  he  appealed  to  the                     chancery  office  to  get  done  a  document  proving  the  historical  truth  of  this                     devotion. The document was made in l906.                           The  Father began placing little boxes in  churches,  shops, and  in stores of       368                     the city and the county specifying the  purpose of  Saint  Anthony's  bread for                     the  orphans,  who  were  called \"Anthonian.\"   In these years,   Brother Joseph                     Anthony   Meli distinguished himself in the zeal for spreading the devotion.                           Through Saint Anthony's bread, the institute began growing far and wide.  On                     June  l3,  l90l,  the  Father  proclaimed  Saint  Anthony,  \"great  benefactor  of  our                     institutes\" as a sign of his gratitude.   \"O   glorious saint,   please accept this                     devout proclamation, constituting yourself our 'great benefactor' in the spiritual                     and  temporal  order.  Obtain  from  the  most  holy  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary                     effective means of sanctification, formation, and improvement of these institutes.                     May they fulfill their good wishes, for the greater consolation of Jesus' Heart\"                     (Vol.  8, page 70).                           The saint's protection on the institute grew along with the spreading of the                     devotion by the press.  First, through the booklet The Miraculous Secret; from                     l908  on,  through  the  monthly  periodical  God  and  Neighbor.    The    monthly                     printing  of  this periodical  reached  300,000 copies at the end  of  the  Father's                     life.    Later,  700,000.    Father  Pantaleone  Palma  was  the  valiant  cooperator  in                     spreading this devotion, as well as the organizer of the Anthonian Secretariats.","Our  founder  preached  widely  the  holy  thaumaturge's  glories  with  triduos,                     novenas, and devotion of thirteen days. He  preached  almost every  year in our                     churches,  or  oratories.    Besides  the  feast  on  June  l3,  he  wanted  us  to                     commemorate  the  translation  of  the  saint's  relics,  as  well  as  the  feast  of  the                     \"Sacred Tongue\" on February  l5.  The saint's tongue remains  uncorrupted  after                     seven centuries from his death.  The Father sang its praise  with prayers  and                     verses.  The center of the Anthonian worship is  in Messina, in the church of the                     Evangelical Rogation, which is also a sanctuary of Saint Anthony.                           The  Father  seized  all  opportunities  to  spread  this  devotion,  whose  value  is                     substantiated by singular episodes.  I report  the following  narration  of Francis                     Stracuzzi from Furci  Siculo,  a citrus fruits dealer.                           In l90l,  his business  was not good.  One day, traveling by train  third  class,                     he sat down near a priest unknown  to  him. While chatting,  Stracuzzi said, \"I                     have to earn a thousand liras to settle my affairs,  but I do not know how in these                     times.  The priest near me said:  'It is easy. It is enough to give a lira to Saint                     Anthony.'  He  said so with such a certainty  that  I  was amazed and curious,  so                     I asked him:  I would be ready to give l0 liras;  in such a case,  would I gain                     l0,000 liras? 'No, he said, only one lira.' When I asked to whom should I give one                     lira,  he told me, 'I am Canon Di Francia, you can give a lira to me.'                    369                           Even  though skeptically,  I gave him a lira.  The following day  I  went  to                     Messina.  As soon as I was out  of  the  railway station,  someone known to me                     by sight as a dealer, approached me and said,  'If  you give me  your parcel of                     oranges  in    Adriano,    I  give    you  a  thousand  liras  of  profit.'  Immediately,    I                     thought of Canon Di Francia,  his promise of a thousand liras,  and I  dealt with                     the  business.  From  then on,  I became an admirer  and  a benefactor of his                     institute.\"                           However,    in    the  presence  of  deviations  the    Father    stated  clearly  the                     meaning of the devotion to Saint Anthony,  writing in The  Miraculous  Secret                     an  \"Important  notice  to    those    who    are  waiting  for  a  grace.\"  \"Usually,    we                     obtain from Saint Anthony the graces we humbly ask with faith. Some people                     obtain  them  quickly;  others,    later;    some  others,  more  later.  A  few  ones,                     however, do not  obtain them after much time.  We exhort them to confide,  to                     persevere    in  the  prayer,    purifying  their  lives.    If   the    saint  grants  favors  to                     sinners,  to souls far off from God, and even to non Catholic persons, he does so                     to guide them on the way of God. The  chief  aim  of those who expect graces                     from  Saint  Anthony should be their spiritual good for eternal salvation;","otherwise, any devotion becomes superstition\" (Page l05, l4 Edition).                       The  Father insisted on making  people consider the devotion to Saint Anthony                     as a help to souls,  who are drawn to God by the saint;  not  as a mere help to                     their needs,  which is also  good.  \"The  continuous miracles the saint has been                     working  the  world over,  since  eight  centuries,  have  won for him the  title  of                     \"Thaumaturge\"  and  a worldly devotion.  But the miracle  of  the miracles  is  his                     continuous rescuing of  souls  everywhere.   He began  doing so effectively and                     widely in his few years of  human life;  now  he is continuing more effectively                     and widely  in  the Christian and in the faithless regions,  from heaven\" (S.C.                     Vol. 3,  page 279). In l924, the Father associated again Saint Anthony to the feast                     of July first. After greeting Jesus in the Sacrament \"tender  and compassionate                     friend  of  sinners,\"  and  the  most    holy  Virgin      \"reconciler    of    sinners,\"    he                     greeted  Saint   Anthony \"perennial conqueror of souls\" (Vol. 30, page l46).                        6. Saint Louis Gonzaga                            An  institution  aiming  at forming the  youth  cannot  help seeking inspiration       370                     in Saint Louis Gonzaga's examples. The Father proposed  him to our youth as a                     model and a patron.  He dedicated to him an altar in our church of Messina,  and                     formed the  \"Pious Union   of  the  Luigini  Children  of  Immaculate  Mary,\"                     whose admissions and promotions occurred on the saint's feast,  after a solemn                     triduo of preparation.                           We  recall  two  extraordinary  feasts  of  the  saint:  the centenary  of  his                     death,  in l89l,  and the  centenary  of  his canonization, in l926.                           In    l89l,    the    Father  said  his  panegyric    in    the    Jesuits'  church,      and                     published  a  beautiful  psalm  on  Il   Corriere Peloritano. The title is Lily and                     Angel. We quote it:","A lily sprouted in the vineyard of Engaddi; its leaves absorbed the morning dew.                          The laborers in the field turned to look at it;  the sunrise dressed it with its                     bright rays.                          Solomon  was not so beautiful in his royal robes when  Queen Shaba looked                     at him ecstatically.                          The  zephyrs  from the mountains put on the perfume  of  its leaves.                          How gentle is the lily of Engaddi's vineyard! The angels of the Lord kissed it                     tenderly, and the celestial beings rejoiced around it.                          It will become a brother to the angels. Look how the lily of the fertile valley                     grows luxuriantly.                          The  profaners  stretched  out  their  hands,    the  world  formed  a  vortex  to                     swallow it, and the storms plumped down over it.                          The winds broke out wildly,  and a thorn fence clasped it to rent  it.  All said,                     \"How beautiful will the lily of Engaddi  be among us>\" But, the angels made it a                     brother of theirs.                          Where  is the  lily ornament of the  field?  Those  of  the highest  spheres                     were  9 times  9,000;  those  of  the  supernal regions, nine times 9,000; and those                     of the sublime heavens, nine times 9,000.                          When  they  appeared  before  the  Most  High,    one  more  angel  was  in  their                     midst.                          The  firmament sang his praise,  saying,  \"The ray of wisdom penetrated him,                     and love pierced his heart.\"                                                              371                          He melted like wax before fire, inebriating himself with the wine of charity.                          He hid under the tree of the cross,  fell  prey to delirium, and the pure love                     fever penetrated his innermost spirit.                          He  exclaimed,  \"Who  will  give me the wings of a  dove  to escape and lift                     up above the earth,  beyond the endless space, to rest in God?\"                          The Son of man tied him with a gold band and hugged him.                          The blond Nazarene transformed him with his love.                          And  the  Virgin Mother of the Nazarene lulled  him  in  the gentle charismas                     of her Immaculate Heart.                          There  is the little enraptured Benjamin,  who made the holy hero of Loyola                     cry with joy.                          Exult, exult, plantation of elect, family of the just.                          The  lily of the vineyard of Engaddi was  transplanted  into your  gardens;                     then  in the gardens of paradise.  It  has  been transformed into an angel.                          Incomprehensible is his glory,  and he untiringly raises his beseeching hands                     to the Most High.                          That the vineyard of Engaddi may bloom with lilies, and children may raise                     wings. He repeats together with the angels the everlasting hymn,   \"Holy, holy,                     holy God of infinite power.\" You confound the mighty, but exalt the humble.","For glory and honor are yours for ever (S.  C.  Vol. 2, page 243).                           The  Catholic  Mother,  a  monthly  periodical  of  Brescia, published the                     whole psalm,  giving the following judgment: \"It is a too beautiful and highly                     inspired canticle... even in the shape of  prose,  it  is  pure,  divinely inspired                     poetry,  in  no  way inferior to Solomon's canticles.\"                          In  l926,  the city celebrated the saint's centenary in  our church,  ending  with                     the  grandiose procession  headed  by  the archbishop, chapter, clergy, and all the                     brotherhood of the city.  The  Father  ordered our communities to celebrate  the                     centenary  with  a  solemn  novena,    spiritual  reading  on  the  saint's  life,  and                     procession  in the house.  A petition was addressed to the  saint \"so that purity of                     soul and life reign in our communities,  being the mind pure;  the heart and the                     affections,  immaculate\"  (Vol. 34, page 2l4).                          Saint  Stanislaus Kostka was just such another Saint  Louis: also  for  him  the                     Father ordered a solemn novena and  the  same practices of piety. On his feast                     day, we made a procession in the house  and  a petition \"so that the saint be a                     protector  of  our houses,  make Jesus and Mary reign,  and instill purity,  morals,                     and perfect observance of religious virtues.\"                          The  strophes pertinent to the prayers,  as well as the hymn to Saint Stanislaus                     were the last  work of the Father. He stopped playing his zither.                                                                                                               372                        7.

Liguori.    The  Father  began  delighting  in  them  since  he  was  a  layman,                     becoming enamored of the saint.  It was perhaps to bear in mind his   examples                     of charity, zeal, and virtues, that","the Father summed up the saint's life in a booklet.  It was published after the                     Father's death. We have already seen (ch.  l,  no.  3) That the Father wrote seven                     prayers to the saint (Vol.  6,  pages l3 and l23) to achieve  his own  conversion;                     and  another  one  to  Jesus  Christ  \"to  take advantage  of  the prayers that the                     saint  promised  to    those    who  would    have    prayed  for  him.\"  He  concludes                     saying,    \"My    glorious  Saint    Alphonsus,    pray  to  Jesus  and  Mary  for  me,                     obtaining  the conversion  of my sinner soul to God,  a tender devotion  to  the                     most holy Virgin Mary,  and the perseverance in the prayer. Amen. Amen\" (Vol.                     6, page l20).                           He  distributed  to  his  communities  the  life  of   Saint Alphonsus  in two                     volume  by  Father  Berthe  for  the  reading  in    the  refectory.    I    report  an                     unforgettable episode.  The writer  said that  the  saint and his followers were so                     poor at Deliceto  that the  saint sometimes was obliged to send his religious to                     bed  to warm themselves during the day.                           \"Oh,  poor them,\"  said the Father.  \"Poor Saint Alphonsus! Children, if we                     had been in those times, wouldn't we have helped them?   We  do  so  now  for                     then,   sending  something  to  the Redemptorist  Fathers in Rome,  with the                     intention of helping the saint's needs of those times!\"  And he did so.                                                                                                               373                          Father Salvatore Di Coste, the superior of the Redemptorists of Francavilla                     Fontana  (Brindisi),  relates  how  he  knew  the  Father  and    how  he  was  greatly                     impressed.    When  the    Redemptorists    were  expelled  by  the  l866  law,    the                     fraternity  of  Immaculate  Mary  took  the    statue  of  Saint  Alphonsus  from  the                     Redemptorist  church.  At the  coming  back  of  the Fathers,  the  fraternity                     planned    to  transfer      the      statue    from    the    Immaculate    church      to      the                     Redemptorists',  in l924.  How all this came to the knowledge  of the Father,                     who was in Oria,  we don't know. \"The fact is,  says Father  Di  Coste,  that when                     I  arrived  to  Immaculate    church    to  organize    the  procession,    I  saw  a  priest                     kneeling in attitude of fervent  prayer,  who  struck  me...   and when  the  statue                     was transferred  to  its old dwelling,  Canon Di Francia  got  up  to accompany  it                     to  our  church.\" This was the  beginning  of  the relation  between  Father  Di                     Coste    and    our    founder,    who    was    preserving    the  saint's  skull-cap.    He                     deprived  himself  of  it  and  gave  it  back  to  the  Redemptorists  of  Francavilla                     Fontana.                           We let the readers know what the Father did when the city of Messina made                     atonement for the blasphemous insults against  Saint Alphonsus.                           Around  the  end  of the XIX  century,  Albert  Grassman,  a Lutheran of                     Stettino (Germany), decided to discredit the ministry","of  confession.    He  began  censuring  the  moral  teaching    of    Saint  Alphonsus,                     quoting incomplete,  or distorted passages. He did so to demonstrate that Saint                     Alphonsus was a spreader of false doctrine, a killer of souls! The same Lutherans                     judged  that  libel  so  defamatory  that  they  sued  Grassman  at  the  Norimberga                     tribunal, and the judge condemned him, prohibiting the sale of the libel.                           This book, however,   was introduced in Italy.  Instead of being prohibited, it                     was advertised by Codrescu in his newspaper The Donkey.  Writes the Father,                     \"Under the auspices of such noble a  beast,   the  enemies  of  the  Church  began                     pouring   forth asininities against Saint Alphonsus\" (S.C. Vol. 9, page ll9). \"In                     the presence of the blasphemous brayings against the saint,  the Catholic faithful                     raised up, reacting firmly everywhere! The name of  Saint Alphonsus resounded                     on  the  lips  of  the    Catholics    with  enthusiasm    in    solemn    feasts,    in    warm                     protests,  in  crowded processions.  A thousand sacred preachers sang the praise                     of  the singular  virtue and the great doctrine of this saint,  giant for talent and                     virtue...\" (Ibid. page l20).(4)                           Atonement  was made everywhere.  The diocesan  committee  of Messina,  of                     which  the  Father   was  a   member,  exalted  Saint Alphonsus'    merits   and                     virtues and appealed  to  the  faithful, inviting them to a public atonement.                                                                                                               374                          A solemn triduo with prayers, songs, and preaching by Father Francis Bruno                     was  held  on  September  l2,    l3,    and    l4,    l90l.    On  September    l5,    85th                     anniversary of the  saint's  beatification, Archbishop  D'Arrigo said the pontifical                     mass,  and Father Bruno, the panegyric.                           The  liturgy  was performed in the  Sacred  Heart's  church, built  by D'Arrigo                     family in l89l.  Canon Letterio consecrated an altar  to  Saint Alphonsus with the                     following dedication  by  the Father. \"So that Messina - city sacred to the Mother                     of God - pay honor  and worship - to the propagator of Mary's glories  - Saint                     Alphonsus  Mary  Liguori - this first altar - is  consecrated  to him\" (S.C. Vol. 9,                     page l55).","8. Saint Veronica Giuliani                           Because  the  devotion  to Saint Veronica  was  unknown  in Messina, we do not                     know how it was born in the Father's heart. We suppose  it happened from the                     reading of her marvelous life.  The Father narrated to us that when he was a boy,                     he  saw  a  companion  of  his  having  a  medal  of  Saint  Alphonsus  and  Saint                     Veronica.  He succeeded  to  exchange it with many of his medals,  amazing  his                     companion.                           Said  the Father smiling,  \"He could not understand my  joy. Saint Alphonsus                     and Saint Veronica were canonized together, and I was fond of both. I still wear                     that medal.\"                           In  l874,  he published a booklet of prayers and  verses  to Saint Veronica,                     writing in the preface, \"So I have fulfilled the vow I made for a grace that the                     saint has granted me benignly.\"                           Evidence  of his devotion to this saint is the prayer to her to obtain \"a true                     conversion,  a confession like the one she made before the Lord, the most holy                     Virgin, and the saints; as well as to  become  a priest according to her way of           375                     thinking.\"  We  have already talked about it in chapter one, no. 3.                           In  l875,  the  Father started his correspondence  with  the Capuchin  sisters  of                     Citta' di Castello,  who hold  the  saint's body.  He  was invited to preach the                     novena  for    her    feast,    but  despite    the  permission  of  the  two  respective                     ordinaries,  he was unable to accomplish it owing to an unexpected sickness.                           The Father's name is tied to the publication of the  saint's marvelous writings.                     Even though he did not bring them to an end, he  still  made  the Italians know                     the \"Hidden Treasure.\"  So  he named the writings.                           The    saint's  manuscripts  were  buried  in  the  archives  of    the  Capuchins    of                     Citta' di Castello.  In  l880,  Francis  Dause  of Grenoble, more than eighty years                     old,    began  publishing  them,  but  he  died  shortly  after.    \"The  work  was                     incomplete,    and  it  was  for  better,    because  Dause  was  publishing  the  saint's                     journal just as it  was  with endless spelling mistakes and lack of  punctuation-                     marks.  Only  a Job would have read it\"  (Cioni,  Saint  Veronica Giuliani, page                     ll3).                           Our  founder was the Job.  But he did not pretend the  Job's patience  from  his                     readers;  so he  corrected  misspelling  and punctuation","marks,  maintaining words and style, which is simple, beautiful, and inspired.                           The  first  volume  was  published  in  l89l  by  \"Prem.    Tip.  dell'  Avvenire                     Giuseppe  Crupi,  Messina.\"  The  Father  prefaces  the saint's  writings with a                     biographical outline.  She  was  endowed with extraordinary gifts by the Lord                     since her early years.                           We quote some passages.                           More than one author said that God gathered in  the life    of Saint  Veronica                     Giuliani a good part of the gifts of divine love, which  we  find  in  several great                     saints.  This  opinion  is  a remarkable praise.  The readers of the prodigious and                     mysterious life  of  this  predestined creature will find  such  an  opinion correct,                     because her life is not admired enough.                           And yet, Saint Veronica Giuliani is a glory of humankind, is a  wonder  of                     God's power,  is decorum and splendor of  the  holy Church,  is a spectacle to the                     world,  the angels,  and men.  She could say of herself in a reduced meaning,                     'God who is mighty has done great things for me'.\"                           Saint  Veronica  is the saint  of  the  suffering.  Martyr's calendar  points out                     that she is \"famous for her strong desire of suffering.\" The Father remarks,              376                           \"She  was  given  the  name  Veronica  not  by  chance,  but according to her                     predestination. Jesus  crucified was so impressed in  the soul and  body of this                     beloved and faithful Veronica  that she  had really impressed in  her heart the                     tools of the  Passion, such as nails,  cross,  thorns, lance, column, and even the                     seven swords  of Mary in sorrow.  These superhuman signs were found  in the                     saint's heart, after her death.\"                           The  Father recalled how the Lord kept the saint in a  state of interior pains for                     the conversion of sinners, making her share purgatory's and,  somehow,  hell's                     pains.  The saint described in detail these pains in her journal,  whose reading                     excites a deep, beneficial impression.  Hence,  a witness relates that the Father                     \"recommended  the devotion to Saint Veronica to achieve the  holy fear of God.\"                           Sickness    and    additional  commitments  prevented    the    Father  from                     continuing  the publication of the  saint's  writings.  The Jesuit  Father Pizzicaria                     endeavored  to  do  it,    but  he  stopped  at  Vol.  7,  in  l905.  The  Father  went  on,                     hoping that he would publish the","remnant  volumes.    During  the  l9l8  European  war,  he  bought  the  paper    and                     stored it in the \"Typography of the  Orphans  by  the Sacred Heart,\" in Citta' di                     Castello.  But, he saw the completion of  such a work from heaven,  because the                     monastery of the  saint brought the publication to an end.                           Writing  to  the  abbess  of  the  monastery  of  the  saint  in  l895,  the    Father                     expounds the reasons which moved him to undertake the work. \"Thanks to the                     most holy Heart of Jesus, I never aspired to be  in  evidence  on the publishing  of                     our    beloved    patroness'  writings.    The  only  ambition  I  had  was  to  draw  her                     protection, to render a service to her, and to please our Lord, arousing his mercy                     on me, a sinner! ... Likewise, I feel obliged to tell you that  any  thought of gain                     was far off from my mind.  I  spent  a thousand  liras,  and I consider them lost,                     because I am selling the  volumes  at the price of half a lira! (The cover price was                     2.50).  May everything be for the greater consolation of Jesus' Heart?\" (Vol. 38,                     page l).                           The sisters let the Father know that they were sorry because someone else was                     substituting him in his enterprise.  The  Father instead heartens them by saying,                           I  don't  know why you  should be sorry if  me,  or  someone else,  or hundred                     persons would undertake the Lord's works, which are  worthy to be revealed,  as                     Scripture says.  Shouldn't we  be happy for that, on condition that we only seek          377                     God's glory? Isn't it  true  that by emulating better charismas  we  increase  God's                     glory  and the salvation of souls?  When the spreading of good is at stake, there                     should be no restriction, but generous spirit and fondness of each other's good.                     For this reason, the apostle wrote to the Philippians,  \"What of it? All that matters                     is that in any and  every way,  whether from specious motives or  genuine  ones,                     Christ is being proclaimed> That is what brings me joy\" (Phil. l, l8). (Ibid.)                           More  than  once  the sisters invited the  Father  to  their convent.  Finally,  the                     Father's dream came true in l9l8, when he stayed  at  Citta' di Castello two days,                     May l6 and l7.  He  was beside  himself  with joy.  Praying before the blessed                     body and seeing the place sanctified by the presence of the great saint excited a                     big fire of love for God in his heart!  On May l9, Pentecost, he writes to Sister                     Mary Nazarena from Rome, \"I was at Citta’ di Castello at the feet of my Saint                     Veronica!  What celestial things? I entered the very observant monastery, said                     the mass in the saint's room, and was given a few pretty relics, among which the                     hand-warmer, where the saint put fire in winter time. I brought you all to Saint                     Veronica\" (Vol. 35, page 2l2).","The  same year,  he was again in Citta' di Castello  on  the feast  of  the saint,                     and  on  July  9  he  wired  to  Messina,    \"I    am  attending  Saint  Veronica's  feast,                     uniting all of you spiritually\" (Vol.  34,  page  25l).  Our houses' chronicles speak                     out of  the Father's  enthusiasm while relating his spiritual  pilgrimage  to Saint                     Veronica,  as well as the fervor of that community.  There, the presence of the                     saint is almost felt.  After many years,  the Father's recollection of that monastery                     was still alive. In l925, Abbess Sister M. Francesca wrote to him, \"We always                     remember your very pleasant visit of many years ago. We hope that you will give                     us  the  satisfaction of listening to you again on the  centenary feast.\"                           The Father celebrated the centenary feast on July 9, l927, in heaven, together                     with the saint!                           Before receiving the hand-warmer, the Father had been given several relics,                     such  as  the  wax  mask  reproducing  the  saint's  features  transhumanized  by  her                     intimate union with God.                        9. Saint Camillus De Lellis                                                                                                                378                       For  the  novena of the third centenary of  Saint  Camillus' death,  in l9l4,  the                     Camillian Fathers of Messina commissioned 9 preachers from the diocesan and                     regular clergy.  The Father spoke the  first day and called the citizens' attention                     on how  Messina was  indebted  to  the  great  saint  for  having  established  a                     religious  community  in the city.                           The  community  of  Camillian  Fathers    lasted  three    centuries,  until    l866,                     when  the suppression law abolished  the  religious orders in Italy. How many                     times, during their staying in Messina, Saint  Camillus' priests worked among the                     people in the midst  of pestilence,  cholera,  epidemics, and earthquake, giving up                     their lives while attending the sick and the dying.  I was a boy at the time  of  the                     suppression  law,  but I perceived  that  in  that circumstance  almost all the city                     was apathetic to the  religious communities,  but  to  the Camillian Fathers.  It                     was  a  common regret. The people could not understand why the Fathers had to                     go away, when they","were practicing the works of charity with  the sick and the dying (Vol. 45, page                     380).                          But,  besides Rome,  two Italian cities have a better ground to sing the praise                     of this great saint:  Naples and Messina.  The reason  is:  Saint  Camillus' heart,                     which was endowed with  the charity,  love,  and compassion of the most holy                     Heart of  Jesus, and  consumed itself in helping the poor,  the humble,  the sick,                     and  the dying,  was extracted from the corpse of Saint  Camillus and divided                     into two parts.  One half was given to  Messina,  the other  one  to Naples.  Oh,                     this is also a sign of Our Lady of Letter’s predilection! That heart seems to be                     saying, “Citizens of Messina, I love you, and I am staying in the midst of you to                     sympathize with your sorrows and sickness. I always bear them in my mind, and                     for this reason I gave you back my Religious\" (Ibid. page 38l).                          Father Ernest Fochesado,  superior of the Camillian Fathers, asked  the Father                     to make a report about Saint  Camillus'  heart. According  to  this  report the heart                     of the  saint  remained  in Messina  because of the Father's zeal (S.C.  Vol.  9,                     pages l37-l42).                          We give a summary of the report.                          First of all, we bring to the readers' knowledge that Father Califano,  superior                     of the Camillian house in Messina,  witnessed Saint Camillus' death in Rome,  on                     July l4,  l6l4. He was given a piece  of the saint's heart as a relic for the Messina     379                     community  (Mario    Vanti,    San  Camillus  de  Lellis,    page  647).    Since    then,                     Messina  held  the  remarkable relic along with  others  and  the silverware of the                     church.  These were held by Father  Sollima,  a former Camillian, who kept them                     until his death.                          When  the  Messina  Camillian  community  died  out,  Father Pandolfini,   the                     superior    provincial    who    had    restored      the  community  in  Palermo,  agreed                     upon  with  Father  Sollima's  heirs  to  transfer  the  Camillians'  belongings  from                     Messina to Palermo; they had also established the day and the formalities.                          Writes  the Father,                          I  was  shocked  at this unexpected turn much more  than  an amateur would                     be  shocked  to  see  a  famous  painting  taken  from    the  city    it    belongs    to.    I                     thought to myself:  if a  precious  old treasure is taken away from a country, its                     people oppose the move by being agitated.  But when a precious relic of a saint is                     about to  be  removed  from Messina,  the city  it's  belonged  to  for centuries, no                     one says a word in protest. Can Messina be deprived of this spiritual treasure and                     perhaps of the saint's protection?                          I was inconsolable!  I went to sleep...   At  dawn...an unrepressible  impulse                     pushed me from inside;  I could no  longer lie  down.  I  got up,  dressed,  left my                     dwellings,  and  walked aimlessly  along Garibaldi Avenue","Even though the streets  were empty because it was early morning,  I ran into                     Father Cucinotta, a  former  Camellian.  When I explained everything  to  him,                     our feelings became one...                           Suddenly,    Father  Cucinotta  had  an  idea:    \"Let's  tell  Father  Sferruzza's                     nephews about this.  Father Sferruzza,  who died  in Messina,  was a superior of                     the Camellians.\" He went alone... and told them that the Camellians'  silverware                     was about to be  taken to Palermo...                           Three  or  four  of the family members,  motivated  to  move quickly by what                     they had heard,  went to the Sollima house, where they waited at the door. When                     the messenger came to transport the silver,  they stepped forward,  warned him,                     and ordered that  he leave...  (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, pages ll5-ll6).                     Thus,  Saint  Camillus'  heart  remained  in  Messina  (S.C.  Vol.  9,  pages  l37  and                     following).                           In  l890,  the  Father wrote a fervent petition to the  most holy  Heart  of  Jesus                     to have the  Camellian  Fathers  back  to Messina;  he also wrote a prayer and a                     hymn to the saint (Vol. 4, page  47).  Our communities said this prayer on the                     l8th of  each month  before  the saint's heart,  which was picked up  from  the                     cathedral every time for such a devotion. Later, fearing that the relic  could  be                     harmed in the transfer,  our  community  stopped doing it,  but said the prayer           380                     until the Camillians came back  to Messina, in l905.                          Let us conclude with a precious episode of simplicity.  Saint Camillus  and                     Saint  Anthony  give the Father  the  occasion  to manifest  the  childish  candor                     of  his  faith  in  the  Blessed Sacrament.                           \"To replace the images of Saint Alphonsus and Saint Camillus after  the fire at                     the wooden church,  he bought two pictures  in Naples for the temporary chapel.                     The sacristan happened to place the pictures in such a way that they were turning                     their backs  to the   tabernacle.   When  the  Father  entered  the  chapel,   he                     immediately noticed their posture and said:  'Blessed son,  don't you  see  that the                     saints are turning their backs to  the  altar? They do not like that>'\" (Father Mary                     Hannibal Di  Francia,  page 278).","10. Saint Francis De Sales                           Since his early youth, the Father delighted in reading Saint Francis of Sales and                     Saint Alphonsus.  He prayed to the former to achieve  meekness,  and spoke of                     him to the community before  the mass on his feast.  He praised his meekness                     and humility; but, we have no prayer to the saint written by the Father.                           It  is  in the last decade of the Father's life that we  see his devotion to the                     saint blazing forth.  It is due to the  ideal  he  reached in l920,  with the Lord's                     grace (Vol.  28,  page l2): \"the  spiritual union\" of the Daughters of Divine Zeal                     with  the Visitation  Daughters  of Mary,  or Salesians,  founded by  Saint Francis                     of Sales.  The Father longed for such a union.  The  Lord had entrusted Saint                     Margaret M.  Alacoque,  one of the Salesians, with  spreading  the devotion to                     the Sacred  Heart.  Through  the spiritual  union,  the Father aimed at drawing the                     Sacred Heart's particular predilection on the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                           The   spiritual  union  involved  the  two  communities   to spiritually share                     their prayers,  observance, practices of piety, and religious virtues.  The Father                     remarks, \"Due to the Daughters of Divine Zeal's spiritual poverty, the sharing is         381                     inadequate; but long live Jesus! The Daughters of Divine Zeal can  offer  to the                     Salesians  the  \"Rogate\"  on  behalf  of  the  beloved  Heart,  giving  them    a  good                     opportunity to become always more pleasant to Jesus' Heart.  They  can  raise                     their effective and fervent  prayers  to obtain the mercy of the mercies from the                     divine  Heart:  numerous and holy priests for all the world\" (Vol.  38, page l3).                     Far from being afraid of doing something inconsistent with their vocation, the                     Salesians  are reminded by the Father of Leo  XIII's  words, \"From  the  Salesians                     we expect the triumph of the  holy  Church. They  have to pray the owner of the                     mystical harvest to send  out workers  to his harvest\" (Vol.  38,  page 2l).  The                     Father  adds, \"Saint  Francis  of Sales named his daughters \"Daughters  of  the                     clergy.\"  With the spreading of this spirit of prayer,  they will become \"Mothers                     of the future clergy\" (Ibid. page 22).                           When  the  Salesians of Rome made the  first  adhesion,  the Father  informed                     the communities about it on  July  2,  l920.  He ordered a special thanksgiving for                     a month,  and exhorted them to fervor.","\"Owing  to  this  spiritual union,  the present  and  future Daughters of Divine                     Zeal may humbly hope that the adorable  Heart of  Jesus  and Mary will love                     them  more.  On condition that   they answer  this   special  grace  with  perfect                     observance,  with  the increase  of  divine  love for the most holy Heart of  Jesus                     and Mary,  with the practice of the religious virtues,  and with  the zeal for the                     interest of Jesus' Heart\" (Vol. 34, page l58).                           At  the  approaching of the third centenary of the death  of Saint Francis of                     Sales, the Daughters of Divine Zeal \"had somehow become   adopted  daughters                     of  the  saint  because   of   their affiliation.  Therefore,  it  was  also right  to                     celebrate  his centenary.\"  So  wrote  the Father in the  inscription  for  this feast.                           The saint died in l622.                           The Father sent to his communities the saint's life in three volumes for the                     reading in the refectory,  that year.  Due to the previous  Christmas  feasts  and                     because the anniversary  of  the saint's death fell on Dec. 28, the preparation was                     performed only with a solemn triduo.   After officiating the liturgy, the Father                     printed a newsletter,  informing the faithful of the feast at the Holy Spirit:  mass                     and preaching in the morning,  vespers in  the evening,  procession  and  petition                     to the saint to  ratify  the spiritual  union  with his daughters.  \"Because we are       382                     closer  to this  religious family,  may Jesus and Immaculate Mary watch  and                     accept us with new clemency,  piety,  and mercy.  O great  saint, grant us this                     favor from the endlessly loving Heart of Jesus. May all of us present and future,                     go deeply into the intimate knowledge and fervor of the very tender love of the                     divine Heart and be entirely consumed!\"                           The  liturgy  ended at 8:00 p.  m.,  singing Te  Deum,   \"to praise  the  Most                     High  for the very happy  death  of  his  most faithful  servant 300 years before at                     8:00 p.m.\" Such  a  liturgy was performed in all of our communities.                           When  the  Father  started  the  Rogationist  seminary  in  Oria,  in  l923,  he                     dedicated  it  to  Saint  Francis  of  Sales  with  a  prayer  for  vocations.    Our                     community  said this prayer on the 29th of  each month,  also  invoking  the                     patron  saints  of  the  town  and  of    the  convent:      Saint    Barsanuphius,    Saint                     Charles  Borromeo,  Saint Francis  of Assisi,  Saint Peter of Alcantara,  and Saint                     Maurus abbot. We said one Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory to be to each of                     them (Vol. 8, page 60).","11. Blessed Eustochio                               Blessed  Eustochio  (l434-l485)  of  the  Kalefati  Colonna  family  was    a    soul                     endowed    with    very    ardent    charity    and    mystical  experiences    as  Saint                     Catherine of Siena,  Saint Teresa of Jesus, and  Saint Veronica Giuliani.  The                     Father was proud of her  as  a glory of Messina,  and said,  \"These are the great                     treasures,  in which  the  Christian  people should glory.  These are  the  real                     glories,  of  which a Catholic city should be proud.\" He  himself nourished  a                     great devotion to the Blessed,  whose  biography  he published in installments in                     l889 on The Light, a weekly Catholic periodical of the city. Later, he published                     the  installments  in  a  booklet    together  with  prayers  and  verses.    Besides                     preaching her novena and saying her panegyric several times,  the Father spread                     the devotion to the Blessed among the faithful,  leading them  to appeal  to  her                     intercession in order to  achieve  the  miracles required by her canonization.                          The  Father kept in touch with the postulator general of the Friars Minor (S.C.                     Vol.  5, page 285), and organized a grandiose pilgrimage  to  the  Blessed's cradle                     at  Annunziata  village  on August 22,  l920.  Archbishop D'Arrigo headed the                     inhabitants  of the  city.  That morning,  the Father said mass in the small barn                     where the Blessed was born.  It was the first time after so  many centuries; the          383                     barn was transformed into a chapel. The pilgrimage ended with a fervent speech                     of the Father in the open.                          He was glad to pay a particular homage to the Blessed in the town  of  Oria.                     The l6l3,  Bishop Lucio Fornari had l0 busts  of saints scupltured,  gilded, and                     bearing the relics of the saints. Each of them was in its own niche,  in a chapel.                     The bust of our Blessed was among them. Around the end of the l700, this bust                     was restored by Bishop Alexander Maria Kalefati,  of the same  family of   the                     Blessed.  The  Latin  inscription at  its  base  reads, \"Blessed Eustochio,  virgin                     from  Messina,  of  the  Kalefati  Colonna  noble  family,  famous  founder  of                     Montevergine  cloister  in  Messina.  Lucio  Ferrari,    bishop  of  Oria,    had  her                     sculptured in l6l3.  His unworthy  successor Alexander Maria Kalefati restored it                     for  the worship in l783.\"                          When  the tottering cathedral of Oria was destroyed in  l750 in  order  to build                     up a new one,  the chapel of the  relics  was eliminated,  and  the  busts  were  set                     aside.  Bishop Kalefati restored them and disposed that they should be adorned                     with flowers and","candles and exposed along with the  relics  on  the communion  rail in special                     circumstances.  When,  still a cleric, the  Father  went  to Oria,  he  venerated  his                     fellow-citizen's relics.                           However, the busts on the communion rail impeded the view of the  altar  and                     the liturgy,  so Bishop Di Tommaso  gathered  the relics in a special niche,  and                     the  busts  got  dispersed.  The  bust  of    our  Blessed  along  with  a  few  others                     happened  to  be  placed    in  the  cathedral's  penthouse,    exposed  to  the    winds,                     spiders,  and chickens.                           As  soon as the Father knew it,  he went to the owner  Canon Cosimo Ferretti.                     Generously benefited by the Father, he willingly gave the Blessed's bust to him.                     The bust was cleaned and taken to our orphanage for boys on October l7, l923.                     The Father along with his  community welcomed the arrival of the bust,  saying                     one  Our Father,  Hail Mary, and Glory to be. Then, they made a procession up                     to  the  sacristy,  where the Father narrated  the  Blessed's marvelous life and said                     some prayers from his booklet.                           A few days later,  the bust was transferred definitively  to the orphanage for                     girls. A special reception was prepared for the Blessed...  The community was                     told that a great lady was going to visit  the institute,  and when all of them were                     waiting in file, dressed festively to welcome the lady... the bust of the Blessed,        384                     the spouse of the king of kings,  the Kalefati family's  daughter was  brought                     among  them...    Restored  properly,    it  was  exposed  in  the  oratory  of  that                     community for the veneration.                           Mysterious  signals to her community,  or to other  persons, such as strokes on                     the furniture,  sound of  bells,  apparitions, unusual  noise in the corridors,  etc.                     are characteristic of the Blessed.                           The  Father  himself  told us how  he  had  experienced  her signals.  One                     year,  he had pledged to say the panegyric of  the Blessed,  but  later he forgot it.                     Three days before the  feast, while  staying  in his room,  he heard three big                     strokes  on  the desks as they were made by fists. His mind immediately thought                     of the Blessed, and of the panegyric.                           Something more impressing happened on January 20, l925.                           In December l924 the Father came back from Rome so seriously sick  as  to                     worry  the  communities.   Inappetence,   insomnia, breathlessness,  and lack of                     strength almost drew him to  receive the last sacraments.","On January 20, l925, the orphans and the sisters of the Holy Spirit  were invited                     to sing the mass at the new provisory chapel in  the  monastery's garden,  where                     the Blessed's body  had  been transferred  from  the parlor.  The Father had given                     a  generous contribution for that. Before leaving, the mother general, Sister M.                     Nazzarena  Maione,  exhorted the youth to pray to the Blessed for the Father's                     healing.                           At  the  gospel,  Msgr.  Bruno  climbed the  pulpit  for  the panegyric.  It was                     about ll:30 a.  m.  The preacher exhorted  the faithful  to pray for the healing of                     Canon Di Francia,  who was a great devotee of the Blessed and a benefactor of                     her monastery.                           All  this went unknown to the Father,  who around  the  same time called                     Brother Mary Anthony Scolaro.  He told him with great effort  and with a feeble                     voice,  \"Today is the Blessed's  feast, let us say one Our Father.\"                           They  were just starting to say the prayer when three  blows resounded.  It was                     like if a hammer had struck on the metal  rain pipe in front of the bed. They were                     not recovered from amazement, when  the three blows resounded again.  With                     mingled feelings  of astonishment, surprise, and fright the brother rushed to call                     the mother superior.  As soon as she enters the room, the three blows resound             385                     again at the same place.  They seek for the cause, but no one  is working around.                     Touched,    the  mother  superior  concludes,  \"Father,    it  is  the  Blessed.\"  The                     Father's quick recovery  proved the mother superior's assertion.  After some time,                     he resumed his activity  and  his traveling to Apulia and Rome for the needs  of                     the houses.                        L2.  Celestial Rogationists and                             Celestial Daughters                             of Divine Zeal                               A witness relates,  \"The Father venerated many  saints,  and made us venerate                     them through preaching,  speeches, and practices of piety.  It seemed to us that                     they were venerated for the first time.\"  We  could prolong the above list of the                     saints by  adding the centenary of Saint Louis M.","Grignion in l9l6,  Saint Vincent Ferreri,  and the canonization of Saint Francis of                     Paola in l9l9; as  well as the feast for the canonization of Saint  Margaret  M.                     Alacoque,  for which we had prayed so much.  At the proper place, we'll talk of                     the devotion to Saint Gertrude.                          We   conclude  this  chapter  by  recalling  the   Celestial Rogationists  and the                     Celestial  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal.    It    is  one    of  the  Father's  \"spiritual                     industries,\" and a  manifestation of his simple, pure faith.                          To    make  the  Rogate  triumph  in  the  world,    the  Father  strove  to  seek                     vocations for his two orders.  In his search,  he thought that the saints in heaven                     are more concerned in achieving such  a goal   than   we  are.   Therefore,   they                     should  protect   the congregations which are consecrated to the Rogate by giving                     them numerous  vocations and by obtaining workers to the  Church.  For this                     reason,  they  are,  no  more  no  less,  Rogationists  and Daughters of Divine                     Zeal in heaven, or in other words, \"Celestial Rogationists or Celestial Daughters                     of Divine Zeal.\"                          Then,  he  began  proclaiming several saints as such  (about 200),  choosing                     those who had the same spirit of the  institute. First,  the  Father proclaimed Saint                     Francis of  Sales  Celestial Rogationist  on January 3l.  However,  due to an error                     of  postal delivery, the dates of their proclamations were reversed.(5)                          A    letter    addressed  to  Father  Vitale  on  January    27,    l9l6,  reports  some                     details:                                                                                  386                           I   think   that  you  have  received  and   performed   the proclamation  of the                     lovely,  glorious Saint Francis of Sales  as celestial  Rogationist  after explaining                     the ceremony   to  these children,  inspiring  them  with fervor and lifting  them                     up    to  heaven    on    the    strong  winds  of  faith>  I  am    mailing    four    more                     proclamations reminding you that the ceremony is private.  If you are  going to                     accomplish it before mass and the people are in the church, you can do it even in                     the choir.                          The  proclamation papers are to be preserved in  a  dossier, which  must be                     glued or sewed after recording them in a  register so  that  they  may be read in                     the refectory every year  the  day before  their  anniversary  in order to offer  the                     mass  to   the Celestial  Rogationists,  or to the Celestial Daughters of Divine                     Zeal.                          We  proclaim Celestial Rogationists or Daughters  of  Divine Zeal  those male                     and  female  saints  we  honor,    love,    admire,    and  invoke,    believing  that  they                     would  like  to  become  Rogationists  or  Daughters    of  Divine  Zeal.    By  this                     proclamation they become our celestial vocations!","In  the  course  of  time,  the  celestial vocations will increase.                           The Rogationists proclaim the male saints; the Daughters of Divine Zeal, the                     female saints; but the sisters also acclaim the male ones.  The Father specifies,                     \"You ask, 'Why doesn't the male community  proclaim  the  female  saints?'  I                     think  it  is  not convenient.  Besides,  the sisters make the proclamation together                     with me, which is valid for them and for us.\"                          Since  this  proclamation was  private,  the  ecclesiastical approval was not                     required.  The Father, however, saw the approval in a curious incident. Listen to                     him:                           One  day  I  went  to our  beloved  archbishop,  having  the manuscript  of  the                     proclamation in my pocket.  When I  put  some papers on the desk,  I also put the                     secret manuscript,  but I did not  retake it.  When I left,  because  of  natural,                     right,  and legitimate  curiosity,  the bishop must have read it to find  out the                     contents    of  my  handwriting...    The  fact  is  that  he  called  Canon  Ciccolo  (a                     member of the chapter!) and told him to deliver the paper to me! The most Rev.                     Canon  Ciccolo  did  so.    Thus,    the  ecclesiastical  approval  was  complete  and                     formal.  The  mysterious disposition  of divine providence liked to approve the                     celestial  vocations    this    way,    and    the    bishop    led  us    on    the    way    of                     improvement!                                                                                                               387                          This was the Father's way of thinking!  But he himself understood that such a                     mind  was  not  understood  by  everyone.  Therefore,  he  added,  \"Unless  they                     thought that I was mad.\"                          And concludes thinking of supernatural.                           \"While human events reduce our ranks and impede vocations, through such                     proclamations  we  are  becoming  an  army  or  a  community  so  numerous  as  to                     outdo  whatever  else  before  long!  What  a  grace  of  the  Lord!  We  will  be  a                     crowded religion in the midst of an uncrowded religion on condition that holy,                     pure, and candid faith be of assistance to us, in the simplicity of heart.  Amen\"                     (Vol. 3l, page 76).                          Notes                         (l)   A similar  reduction was made after  the  Council  of Trent.  The missal published by Saint                     Pius V counterbalanced  the ferial  days and the feasts of the saints.  But,  in the long","run and  with  the  new  canonizations,  the  feasts  of  the                      saints  increased  in  number  (See  Catholic  Encyclopedia:    calendar  of    the  universal                     Church).                           (2)  We  remember Saint Mary Magdalene,  King  David,  Saint Andrew apostle,                     Saint Hilarion,  Saint Catherine,  Saint Albert, etc.                           (3)  Here they are:  Michael,  God's  zeal.  Gabriel,  God's strength.  Raphael, God's                     physician.  Uriel,  God's  fire.  Saaltiel,  God's  prayer.  Geudiele,  God's  praise.  Baradiel,                     God's blessing.                          Commenting on the Book of Revelation,  Alapide reports these names  from  the                     private revelation of Blessed Amodeo  of  Sylva, from  Portugal.  The  Blessed lived in                     Rome under Pius Sixtus  IV (l47l-l484),  and was his confessor. But even before, these                     names were  known in several Italian cities.  When in l5l6  Anthony  Lo Duca  opened                     in  Palermo  the church  of  Saint  Angel,  several centuries  old,  near the cathedral,  he                     found seven angels  with their names painted on the walls;  and he renewed the devotion                     in Sicily.  Lo  Duca built a convent near the church,  but both  the church  and  the                     convent were destroyed  by  fire.  The  square, however,  is  still named \"The seven                     angels.\"  Lo  Duca  spread    the  devotion  in  Rome,  and  obtained  by  Pius  IV  that                     Michelangelo build the  basilica  of  Saint Mary of the  Angels,  which  before  was                     dedicated  to  \"Saint Mary of the Seven Angels.\" As a  matter  of fact,  the  picture                     painted in Venice in l543,  on behalf of  Lo Duca,  represents the most holy Virgin with                     the child  surrounded by seven angels.  (V.C.  Bernardi Salvetti, S. Maria degli Angeli   388                     alle Terme e Antonio Lo Duca, Desclee \& C. Editori Pontifici).                           (4)  We  have a hymn by the Father to Saint Joseph  for  the crowning  of his statue                     at Caudino of Arcevia (Ancona).  In  that time the crowning was performed by decree                     of the Congregation  of Rites  and only for the pictures of Our Lord and Our  Lady.                     They made  an  exception  for Saint Joseph's statue  at  Caudino.  The solemn  crowning                     happened on July 26,  l904.  It seems  that  the Father  wrote  the  hymn  by  invitation                     of  his  friend  Father Biaschelli,  superior  general  of the Missionaries of  the  Most                     Precious Blood.  He was interested in achieving the decree by the sacred congregation.                           (5)  Perhaps,    on  that  occasion,    the  Father  added  the  prayer  for  spreading  the                     devotion to Saint Alphonsus Mary to the list of his personal prayers (Vol. 4, page 97).                           (6)  The  writings  of the Father have the  proclamation  of Saint  Gerard  Maiella on                     October l6,  l9l5,  as the  first  one. Perhaps it was performed in Messina only.                           (7) According to Malachi prophesies,  this was the  symbolic name  of  Benedict XV.                     But,  this assonance is not a happy  one, because it does not express  well the idea.  As a                     matter of fact, both the Latin verbs depopulo and populo mean destroy. The Father gave                     to the word populata the Italian meaning of increased.","l3.

Con  Gesu'  nel deserto,  by Father  Voillaume,  clears  the current  situation                     of the revolt against prayer in meditation no. 6.  \"We  are facing a psychological                     transformation of human  mind with respect to prayer. All forms of prayer are                     under attack from critique.  The community prayer is perhaps excluded,  even                     though in  certain  cases  we  could ask if it is  prayer  or  rather  a community's                     expression.\"                           Today,    people    push  to  the  extremes  the  valuation    of    what  they  call                     \"liturgical  and  biblical  religiousness,\"  systematically  undervaluing    any    other                     expression  of    religiousness.    They    are  convinced      that    the    liturgical                     celebrations  are  enough   to substitute   any  practice  of  piety.   But  this                     judgment   is incomplete,  because  if Sacrosanctum Concilium at no.  10 states                     that  \"the  liturgy  is  the  summit  toward  which  the  activity  of    the  Church  is                     directed and the fount from which all her power flows,\" the same document at                     no.  9  says  that  \"the  sacred  liturgy  does  not  exhaust    the  entire  activity  of  the   390                     Church.\" As a matter of fact, also Jesus points to a personal prayer. \"Whenever                     you pray, go to your room,  close your door,  and pray to your Father in private\"                     (Mt.  6,  6). And the Council reminds us of this gospel's passage (S.C. l2).                          \"People  fool themselves when they consider  the  liturgical prayer  enough                     for  their  Christian  life,   because  the  true liturgical  prayer requires the prayer                     of  the  heart,    besides  the  gestures    of    the  body.    Only  the  personal  prayer                     enkindles  and nourishes the flames of the heart, and only this prayer makes the                     people    delight  in  liturgy,    keeping  them  far  from  formalism    and  routine\"                     (Civilta' Cattolica, June 6, l970, page 523).                           Personal  piety prepares and  accompanies  liturgy,  because through personal                     piety each member of the community cooperates in forming  the  psychological                     environment of  faith,  charity,  and recollection","which  ward  off  the  idea  of  a  gathering  for  magic.  If  one    is    not  personally                     prepared,  no  liturgical  gathering  can transform  the gathering into prayer .  The                     personal  share  of  the  community's    members    in  liturgy  has  its  own  value  in                     connection with the personal relation to  God,  who is over the   community's                     circle.  If the personal union with God is absent because of lack of private piety,                     one's staying with hundred thousands of people performing  the same liturgical                     action is useless\"  (L.M.  Carli, Nova et Vetera,  Istituto Editor.  Mediterraneo,                     Rome, pages l65-l66).                           This  is  Paul VI's teaching:  decrease of  personal  prayer \"threatens  liturgy                     with interior impoverishment,  external rite, and formal practice\" (May 22, l970).                        2. Do people pray today?                              Given  the great confusion of ideas about the principles  of prayer, the Holy                     Father is concerned with calling the faithful to sound doctrine. We feel obliged to                     quote some of his thoughts.                          The Pope reproves the behavior of \"those who feel themselves satisfied  with         391                     charity for neighbor,  but hold charity  for  God useless.  Everyone knows the                     negative effects of such a spiritual attitude.  It holds that only action,  not prayer                     makes up a true Christian  life.  The  social sense replaces the  religious  one\"                     (August    2l,    l969).    The    Holy  Father  reminds  \"the    faithful    to  return    to                     personal  prayer.  We say return,  because  it's  our opinion that even the good,                     the faithful, the consecrated to the Lord pray less...  Do people pray today? Does                     the modern man know how  to pray?  Does he feel obliged to?  Does he feel in                     need  of prayer? Does the Christian have the gift, or taste, or engagement for                     prayer?\" The Pope recalls the rosary,  the way of the  cross, etc.,  above all the                     meditation,  the adoration of the Eucharist, the examination of conscience,  and                     the spiritual reading.  \"Even though the Church has never declared these prayers                     as liturgical, it always taught and recommended them\" (August l3,  l969). Later,                     he continues insisting:  \"Today more than ever we have to nourish a  spirit and a                     practice  of  personal  prayer...    Our  understanding  of  things  and  events,  the                     mysterious,","necessary  help  of  grace  are  lowering,  or  are  failing  for  lack  of  prayer.\"  He                     touches  upon  the  painful  crisis  we  are  witnessing  these  years.  \"We  think  that                     many  of  the  spiritual  and  moral  crisis  of  learned  persons  inserted    in  the                     ecclesiastical body are due to weakness, or lack of a regular and intense life of                     prayer,    which  was  sustained  by  wise  external  customs    before.    Once  these                     customs were abandoned,  the  prayer died out along with faithfulness and joy\"                     (August 20, l969).                           Let   us  meet  the  Pope's  sad,   paternal  invitation  to consecrated souls.                     \"Dear Religious,  how could you fail desiring to better know the One you love                     and want to manifest to  men?  It is  prayer that joins you to him! If you had lost                     its taste,  you would  feel  desiring  it,   praying  humbly  again\"  (Evangelica                     testificatio, no. 42).                        3. Sentiment and sentimentalism                              The cry of rebellion against vocal,  private prayer wants to safeguard itself by     392                     the  pretext  that  such  a  prayer  may  stifle  the  fit    of    internal    enthusiasm,                     becoming  sentimentalism.  These miseries,  however, are due to weakness of                     human  nature,  whatever  the  method  and  the  form  of  prayer  may  be.    For                     instance,  we have already   seen   how  Father  Voillaume  complained   about                     the community's prayer.                           Besides,   we   should   avoid  confusing   sentiment   with sentimentalism.                     The first requires a vivid, deep talk with God in the  innermost  of  the  heart,                     which    fosters    divine      union.  Sentimentalism    instead    is    the    sentiment's                     degeneration,      or  nebulous    evanescence,    which  fosters  no  virtue,    rather                     deceives  souls.    Unless    we    want    to  turn  prayer    into    sound    of    words,                     sentiment   is  necessary.   Someone  wrote  that  geniuses  need sentiment in art;                     heroes, in battle; and saints, in religion.                           Saint Alphonsus  was an apostle and a doctor of this kind of prayer; and this                     kind of prayer has formed the saints in the last centuries.","We    quote  two  prayers  by  the  Father,    rich  with    sentiments,  but  lacking                     sentimentalism.                          From the thanksgiving for the most holy Communion:                           \"The  patriarchs and the prophets called Jesus  Christ  with ardent sighs,  but                     they did not see him.  O my soul,  you instead were  worthy to receive him in                     your chest! ...  Lucky is my mouth that opened to receive him! ...  Lucky is my                     tongue that welcomed him... Lucky is my breast that lodged him!...\"                           Let us come to the point:                           \"For  your  sake  I want to suffer  set-backs,  to  obey  my superiors, to be                     humble with everyone, to love everyone as myself in  your charity.  For  your                     sake  I  will  observe  silence,    I    will  respond  with  anger  to  none  of  those  who                     offend me,  and will find no excuse when they reproach me...\" (Vol. 2, page l6).                           A   prayer   to  the  Immaculate  Heart  of  Mary  for   the sanctification of the                     clerics says,                           O  purest  Immaculate Heart of Mary,   I recommend  all  the clerics to you:                     receive  them  under  your  particular  protection...  Holy    Mother,    here    is    the   393                     beautiful,  golden  harvest  of  the Church's  fields,  hope  of the mystical spouse                     of  Jesus.  Holy Mother,  assemble it in your Immaculate Heart and bring it up                     for Jesus.  For  the  sake of Jesus,  we beseech you  to  detach  the clerics  from                     earthly affection.  Since they are committed to the divine  service,  see to it that                     nothing tie them to this  shabby world,  nor to any creature.  Please clear out their                     young hearts of  any earthly thing and fill them with divine love.  Mother  of the                     beautiful love,  make these souls longing for the  priesthood enamored of Jesus:                     fill  their  hearts,  their  thoughts,  and  all  the  powers    of  their  spirit  with  Jesus.                     Starting from now,  may they know and love fervently Jesus so that they may                     lead the people to know  and  love him...  O purest,  immaculate  Mother,  make                     the candidates for the priesthood immaculate so that they walk on the road  of                     perfection with purity of heart  and  conscience,  grow humble  and  obedient,                     meek and  pious,  practicing  prayer  and attending the holy sacraments (Vol. 7,                     page l4).                           Away  with  sentimentalism! The Father wrote for  the  first novices,  \"The                     piety    and    devotion  of  the    novices    be    simple,  sincere,  fervent,  free  of                     artificiality, scruples, and illusions. They will mind the substance not the form of                     piety\" (Vol. 2, page 3l).","4. Evidences                              Before  proceeding further,  we resort to evidences.  In the previous chapters,                     talking about the Father's love for our Lord, the most holy Virgin,  the angels,                     and the saints, we have quoted some of them; now, we quote other ones which                     related to prayer.                          First, we begin with generic evidences.                          The    Father    was  a  man  of  an    intense,    interior    life,    who  prayed  and                     meditated  with  a  great  spirit  of  faith.    He  was  always  absorbed    in  God;      it                     appeared from his  behavior.  Says  Father Vitale,                           Men  of God are men of prayer.   We cannot find any of  them without this                     characteristic.    Some  of  them  lack  science,  or  great  works,    or  the  gift  of                     miracles,  or other virtues, but never the spirit  of prayer which joins them to God                     and  draws  his  divine graces.  Those  who lived far from the Father,  or had no                     strict connection  with him can understand his spirit of prayer from the many he                     wrote in the various circumstances.                          His  living faith,  the feelings of his soul,  and his great trust in God were the                     ground  of  his  confidence  that  he  would  have  obtained    everything  through       394                     prayer.  What a great sweetness  and unction  he  transfused in  his   prayers.  His                     loving,  tender, effective  expressions  addressed to our Lord in the  private  or                     common  needs  penetrate into the heart as odorous balm.  We  say many of these                     prayers every now and then in our communities,  but they  seem to us always                     new, pretty, and inspired; not tiring, nor boring...  Due  to this spirit,  the Father                     used to spend a  long time  in  prayer even when he was prostrated by his work                     for  the institute.                          When he thought that a grace was late to come, he exclaimed, \"Oh,  let  us                     say  an  effective,  powerful  novena...\"  And  he sometimes  said,  \"The Lord                     grants me everything!...\" Lucky  him, who deserved it!                          Now and then he gathered the community in the church, saying long prayers                     without taking care of the affairs, nor tiredness... because  those were times we                     had to avoid an overhanging  danger, or  to seek enlightenments from God,  or to                     face  urgent    needs...  His    private  speeches  regarding  the  institution's  or    the                     poor's needs, or the salvation of souls, ended with","these words, \"Let us pray,  let  us  pray!\"  These words were pronounced with                     such    a  feeling  that  they  penetrated  the  spirit  of  the  Father's  listeners  as    a                     celestial voice,  according to  the  witnesses'  assertion (Bulletin l929, pages l55-                     l57).                           The  Father  was exceptionally fond of  vocal  prayers,  and spent a long time                     in  saying  them.    He  used  to  do  so  even  with  his  listeners  at  the  end  of  his                     preaching.  As to his meditation,  he spent  more than half an hour on the Passion                     before  saying    mass,  using    the    book    by  Blessed  Thomas    of    Jesus.    His                     afternoon’s meditation was on God's benefits, reading Blessed Sarnelli; or on the                     eternal truths, reading Saint Alphonsus de Liguori.  He ordered his communities                     to do the same, and recommended nightly prayer in the chapel. Perhaps to help                     his  imagination,  he  used  to  look  at  many  sacred  pictures  in  his  room.    His                     speeches and conversations were permeated by his union with the Lord.                          As  to  his  custom  of  meditating  before  sacred  pictures,  such  practice  is                     recommended by Saint Theresa, but we do not know whether the Father learned                     it from her.  \"A good means to be  in the presence of the Lord is having a picture                     or painting of  his, inspiring  devotion;  by looking at it,  it helps us  enlarge our                     conversation with him\" (Cammino di perfezione, ch. 26, no. 9).                           \"The  Father  was  continuously  in  prayer.  I  saw  him  many  times  kneeling     395                     before  the  bed,  doing  the  morning  meditation  prescribed  by  the  rule,  while                     looking at  many  sacred pictures displayed.  As long as health allowed him, he                     also practiced nightly  prayer.  I slept so long in an adjacent room; therefore I                     realized when he got up to pray.  Above all, it happened when he had to repair                     inconveniences of our communities.  When I was still a cleric, he recommended                     to me nightly prayer with a great simplicity, because he thought that it was easy                     even for a young student.  He said plenty of vocal prayers, and most of the many                     he printed were of his own.  His mental prayer was lengthier, especially before                     and after mass. His morning and afternoon meditation according to our rule was                     about  the  Passion  and  the  intimate  sorrows  of  Jesus.  To  avoid  tiredness,  he                     meditated  partly  kneeling  and  standing;  in  the  morning,  however,  mostly                     kneeling.  To  help  his  meditation,  he  used  to  display  many  sacred,  inspiring                     pictures.  He was always recollected in God, and his conversations had an odor                     of God’s presence.\"                          \"He got up before 5:00 a.  m., and meditated for an hour. After the mass, he                     said the thanksgiving prayer.  Now and then during the day, he passed by the                     church to pray, always kneeling. He exhorted us always to say a prayer before                     any action for the","success  of  it  and  for  the  glory  of  the  Lord.    A  sister  remembers,  \"One  day,                     thinking that the Father was out, I entered his room to put things in order.  He                     was kneeling with raised hands and eyes toward the sky.  He did not realize my                     presence, and the noise I made in the ante-room.  Afraid, I went out.\" He prayed                     the vocal prayers with raised hands, in the shape of the cross, and exhorted us to                     imitate him. If someone of the orphans forgot it, the Father reminded him by a                     clap of   his hands.    He often  meditated on the  mysteries of the  Passion, and                     exhorted us to do the same.  After the mass, he went to his room to continue his                     morning meditation, which he had begun before we entered the chapel.  In fact,                     the light of his room was on before our reveille.                           \"When he was with us, he said the vocal prayers together. I even saw him                     weeping.  I also saw him in his room several times, in Oria, in attitude of prayer,                     almost  never  leaning.  I  think  he  meditated  every  day  for  at  least  an  hour.    If                     someone went to his room in the  morning, he found the Father in meditation.                     When I was in Oria, if someone asked the Father for something before the mass,                     he used to say, ‘Sorry, I am preparing myself for mass.' But he was available for                     works of charity, or confession. In the evening, he used to meditate on the divine                     benefits, using the book by Sarnelli, which he recommended to us.\"                           In  his  last  sickness,  the Father was  helped  for  about fifteen  days by                     Father Carmel,  who remembers,  \"He always  said vocal prayers, and sometimes             396                     reprimanded me, who wandered because of tiredness.\"                           He wrote several times how to say vocal prayers in common. \"Prayer must be                     in  unison,  with  feeble  and  contrite  voice.    To  avoid  errors,  rehearsal  shall  be                     done.\" Sometimes, he himself presided over the rehearsal, signaling the pauses                     with a little bell.  We conclude with an episode narrated by sisters.  Once, while                     walking  with  the  Father  in  a  muddy  road,  the  bell  rang  Angelus.  The  Father                     knelt,  and  we  followed  his  example.  If  we  had  been  alone,  we  wouldn't  have                     done so.\" Usually, Angelus ended with the ejaculatory prayer, \"Send, O Lord,                     holy apostles to your harvest.\" And we added, “Therefore, also in this one.\" After                     so many years, Father Spina remembered how \"the Father accompanied the word                     therefore, with his hand's and head's gesture.\"","5. The spirit of prayer                              Let  us  recall  a  disposition  of  the  Second  Vatican  Council:  \"Members  of                     institutes should assiduously cultivate the spirit of prayer and prayer itself\" (P.C.                     no. 6).                          When a person often prays with fervor, we say that he/she has the spirit of                     prayer.  In fact, due to their interdependence, love for prayer and spirit of prayer                     strengthens each other. Strictly speaking, however, prayer and spirit of prayer are                     not the same.                          The spirit of prayer is the habitual disposition of a person to  be  in  touch                     with God by praying   according  to  the  Lord's teaching,  \"He  told  them a                     parable  on  the  necessity  of    praying  always  and  not  losing  heart\"  (Lk.    l8,  l).                     Saint Paul also wrote, \"Never cease praying\" (Thes. 5, l7). People do that in the                     way  it  is  possible,  transforming  their  actions  into  prayer,  without  leaving  out                     their duties.                          Is it possible such a transformation?  The Father suggests, \"Before any action                     we have to lift up our mind to God, with the intention to pray and thank him in                     any  moment.      This  intention  is  called  virtual,  and  makes  up  for  human                     weakness, which is unable always to stay in actual prayer.  In his kindness,   our        397                     Lord  welcomes  any  loving  intention  to  do  what  human  weakness  or  other                     conditions cannot\" (Vol. l, page 74).                          This is the teaching of the masters of the spirit.  The intention of praying in                     any moment, however, could remain.... a simple intention.  Therefore,  one  of                     the authors of  Perfectae  caritatis,  by experience writes,  \"The Council Fathers                     had  only written  'the  spirit of prayer,' but to be actual  and  positive they  added                     'the prayer itself,' because both of them are needed. It  should  be obvious that the                     spirit  of  prayer  be    joined    with  prayer,    but    the    Council  took  its  wise                     precautions  by  saying, 'Members of institutes should assiduously cultivate the                     spirit  of  prayer  and  prayer  itself'\"  (Father  Anastasio  del  SS.    Rosario,  La  vita                     religiosa  nella Chiesa  alla luce   del   Concilio  Ecumenico Vaticano II, page                     l89).                           How much should the religious pray?                           Rules and tradition mark the least indispensable to keep the spirit of prayer                     alive in the Religious, according to their vocation.  A faulty lack of attention in                     the practices of piety has negative influence on the spirit of prayer.  Hence the                     Father's care that all of us be very faithful to the established practices of piety.","The ambient of recollection in the religious house helps the spirit of prayer,                     and the rules are very concerned with it. Paul VI emphasizes this point.  \"The                     spiritual man perceives the times of  silence  as  required by divine love,  and                     needs  a  certain solitude  to  feel  God,  who speaks to  his  heart\"  (Evangelica                     testificatio, no. 46).                           Let   us   recall that the Father held silence as   an indispensable factor of                     recollection and interior life.  He  was very   jealous  of  it,  and wished that even                     while  opening  or closing  the   doors one  should avoid  noise.   If  someone                     talked  aloud,    he  signaled  to  him  with  the  gesture  and  a  feeble  voice  to  be                     moderate,  often adding a proper saying,  such as the one   of Isaiah which is                     applied to Jesus, \"Not crying out, not shouting, not making his voice heard in the                     street\" (Is. 42, 2).                           Once, while staying at La Guardia, he noticed that the peace of the ambient                     was disturbed by thirteen guinea hens cheekily cackling.  He had them killed for                     food of the communities; the remnant were sent to the community of the Holy                     Spirit with this note, \"The were killed because they did not observe silence.\"                       6. Asking the spirit of prayer                                                            398                              Both   prayer and knowledge of how to pray is a gift from God.  Scripture is                     decisive on this point.  \"The Spirit too helps in our weakness, for we do not know                     how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself makes intercession for us with                     groaning that cannot be expressed in speech\" (Rom. 8, 26). For this reason, God                     gives the Church the spirit of prayer.  \"I will pour out on the house of David and                     on the inhabitants a spirit of grace and petition\" (Zech. l2, l0).                          The Father asked the spirit of prayer insistently.  \"Dear Jesus, divine teacher,                     you ordered prayer as a necessary means of salvation, give me a spirit of fervent                     prayer for the interests of your divine Heart\" (Vol. 6, page 99).                          When  the  Father  became  a  Carmelite  tertiary,    he  was    called  John  of  the                     Cross from Saint John of the Cross, a mystical doctor","and   a great teacher of prayer,   who became  his special patron and  to  whom                     he appealed for the  gift  of  prayer.  We quote:                       My  glorious  Saint  John  of  the  Cross,  I  kneel  trustfully  at  your  feet,  invoking  your                     powerful intercession. I am exceedingly miserable and ignorant of holy prayer. For this                     reason my soul is  as  barren of virtues  as  a sterile land, rather it bears thorns of bad                     inclinations  and sins! I long for applying myself  to  holy prayer,  even  though  is too                     late because I have spent  so  many years  in  vain through my fault.  I beg you to accept                     me as the last of your disciples.  Be my teacher of holy prayer.  Give me your merciful,                     helping hand to enter the way of salvation and to improve in it.  You  were  so endowed                     with  the  treasures  of celestial  wisdom  that  you  reached  the  top  of  the   divine                     contemplation.   You   were   so   prepared  with   the   perfect mortification  of  the                     senses;  as well as  experienced  in  the nightly darkness of faith,  perfectly detached                     from  everything, and humbly guided by the movements of grace and the operations of                     the Holy Spirit.  For the sake of divine kindness, which made you a  great contemplative                     saint,  I humbly beg you to grant me  from the  most  holy Heart of Jesus an effective                     grace so that  I  may deny any satisfaction of the senses,  mortify my passions, subdue                     my selfishness,  and make my spirit die to the world.  So, I will be free and ready for                     holy prayer, as the Lord wants. My glorious saint, see to it that love and humility be                     always joined in my prayer, and my spirit be always applied in it. So, and through a                     perfect conformity, I can achieve divine union with the divine will.  You were a great                     teacher of souls,  show me the way  I have to  run along, put  me  in  guard against the   399                     snares of selfishness, my bad nature, demon, or any deceiving direction.  Keep me far                     from  spiritual  vanities  and  illusions  of  fantasy;  make  me  run  along  the  way  of  holy                     oration with pure faith, only seeking God. Take care of my poor soul,  which is starving                     for being unable to pick  up the manna and draw water! When my cold,  dry,  careless,                     and oppressed spirit recoils from holy prayer,  you,  my sweetest teacher,  lead  me                     strongly and gently with the same zeal as  you did with souls during your life..  For the                     sake of your zeal, I beseech you to obtain this gift to me.  If am unworthy of it because                     of my faults, or natural defects, you submit your merit to Jesus.  For  the  sake of his                     most  holy  wounds,  impetrate forgiveness  of  my sins,  creating a new heart  and  an                     upright spirit in me. How many times I became unworthy of this great gift because  of                     my sins and my unfaithfulness to grace! I made myself for  ever  unworthy  of such a                     sublime gift! Since  mine  it's  a serious  case  and my cause is lost,  I appeal to you who                     are  a great,  zealous   teacher of holy prayer.  Be my lawyer near the throne of divine                     mercy, and give me back what I have lost.  My dear  Saint John,  you know in God my                     miseries,  the needs of  my soul,  my nature and sins,  the bad inclinations and wishes.                     You know the way I have to run according to the will of God, and how short my life is                     to make me better...  Therefore, I surrender myself into your hands. I do not ask for high                     contemplations; not at all, but the grace to run along the way of holy prayer. I hope to                     achieve it through you, for the sake of Jesus, Mary, Saint Joseph, Saint Theresa, and the                     holy cross. Please hear me, hear me quickly (Vol. 6, page l3l).","7. The pale flame                              The Father does not aim at rapture, or mystical heights of Saint John of the                     Cross, as they are excellently described by the saint in the Alive Flame.  Rather,                     he finds himself so far from them that he writes four strophes antithetic to the                     four strophes of Alive Flame. (l) The Father applies to himself \"the pitiable state                     of a soul who is far from divine union, and is full   with himself and creatures.                                   O very pale flame                                   That freeze and waste                                    The heart in its inner darkness,                                   Whether you triumph or hiss                                   Squeaking, you show                                   How different you are from what I know!                                    Flame drawing from the eyes                                   Bitter tears,                                   Deeply wounding by twice hitting,                                   Flame of horrid hell,                                                       400                                   By changing life into death                                   You make people always pay.                                    Flash of horrid fire,                                   Whose gloomy glare                                   Wraps the inner caves of my chest,                                   You freeze and darken the good                                   To me, who was blind and bare?

How full with worries                                   You awake in my chest,                                   Where you unfortunately dwell!

Have mercy! Have mercy! Have                     mercy!\" (S.C.  Vol.  l0,  page  20).  Writes Father Vitale,                          We  do  not  know if he experienced infused gifts  from  the celestial  patrons                     because he denied it.  But it is sure that  he talked of all kinds of supernatural                     prayers, beginning with quiet ones up to the mystic nuptials,  with  clearness,                     lucidity,  and exactitude as if he had experienced them.  He was acquainted with                     the  works of Saint John of the Cross,  Saint Teresa,  and  Saint John Climaco.                     Dark night, mystical stairs, ascensions of Theresa were  no problem for him to                     understand.  He solved these  puzzles without any objection or doubt; in fact he                     seemed somewhat expert at understanding such complicated things (Father Mary                     Hannibal Di Francia, page 29l).                          Father Vitale also wrote,                          When  I  was  a youth,  but not yet a  priest,  a  spiritual learned man for fear                     that I could deceive myself by prayer warned me,  \"Mind not to read Saint John                     of the Cross.\"  I informed  the Father,  who  answered,  \"That holy man did not                     read it.\" When  I happened  to  read Saint John of the Cross,  I realized that  the                     holy  man  had  read  it,  but  he  had  not  understood  certain ascensions  of                     mystic    states,      as    myself.      They    cannot      be  understood,    unless    people                     experience   them.  What  about  the Father?  However  it  may be,  holiness does                     not consist  in  the infused prayer,  which rather may be dangerous.  Therefore, it       401                     is enough for us to know that the Father was a man of a great spirit of prayer,                     and we should imitate him.  Living together with him, we accompanied him in                     the streets,  houses,  churches, rooms, and heard  some  invocations at low voice,                     sighs,  and  wails  which slipped out of his mouth. We deem that all these were                     ejaculatory prayers,  because the Father always  aimed at  being in touch  with                     heaven through constant prayer (Bulletin, l929, page l57).                          The Father often said that the Lord \"gave our institute  the spirit of prayer\";                     but we point out that the founder conveyed it. In  the preface to the prayer book                     of the community,  the  Father points  out,                          Prayer  is  the sure,  infallible means  that  the  infinite kindness  of  the most                     holy Heart of Jesus gave us to obtain  any grace, as well as eternal life for us and                     for others.                          This  least  institute  passed through so  many  events  and vicissitudes.  Since                     its beginning,  it was nourished by  prayers and  practices of piety,  and pushed                     forth by  ingenious,  sacred industries.  Prayer  and  piety  formed the  aspiration                     and  the respiration  of this least creature of the Lord.  All of  us  are witnesses of                     the singular and sometimes prodigious graces that we have","obtained  through  these  divine  means  over  so  many  years.    We  have  seen  this                     pious  institution  along  with  its  religious  houses,  its    orphanages,    and  its                     unexpected celestial means rising  from nothing (S.C. Vol. 9, page 2).                           We  have said that the spirit of the institute reflects  the spirit of the founder,                     who made prayer the soul of his life.                           Writing  to a spiritual daughter,  he says,  \"Do  everything with prayer\" (S.C.                     Vol. 5, page 257). A sister reports a graceful episode.  A door of the house of                     Trani  was  stuck,  and  the  sisters  were  unable  to  open  it,  their  efforts                     notwithstanding.  While  they  were  maneuvering  again  to  open  it,  the  Father                     passed  by  and  asked  if  they  had  prayed.    At  the  negative  answer,    he  added                     seriously, \"How do you dare start an action without praying before?\" He said a                     Hail Mary together with the sisters.  Shortly after,  a sister gave a push, and the                     door opened easily. He wrote, \"The prayer is necessary to everything\" (Vol.  39,                     page  35).  \"Do  everything  with  prayer.\"    Even    though    absorbed  by  the  daily                     activity  and  the worries of his institute,  he held prayer first, as the engine of his                     activity.  According  to Saint Bonaventure,  quoted  by  the Father (S.C.  Vol.  l0,                     page 33),   \"The  time  we spend  praying is rewarded by  God  with his blessing                     upon our works.\"                           Prayer  is the secret of the work's success:                                         402                           It  is  the  fire,    which  produces    the  energy,  and  the  driving  power    which                     moves  all  things.    Ah!  without  the    interior  fire,  which  we  call  spiritual  life,                     neither prayer nor penance, nor any relationship between creature and Creator,                     nor a loving union of the soul with God may be achieved.  No redeeming word                     can be said to conquer the hearts,  no truly useful,  lasting beneficence can be                     accomplished. Without this fire, any struggle can be summed up in this statement                     of the apostle, \"I have become like one beating the air, like an instrument,                     whose sound makes a vanishing noise\" (I Cor. l3...)                           Interior  life,  union  with  God,  zeal,  charity,  and  thirst  for  souls    give    the                     people of God a great weapon  to  perform  great things  for  the Lord and for                     souls,    not  through  their    personal  work,    sacrifices,    money,  and  talent,  but                     through  the  invisible,  or  better  yet,  the  visible  help  of  the  divine  power.  This                     weapon, which helps us prevail over everything,  this golden  key,  which opens                     the treasure of divine grace,  is prayer.  A Servant of God (Father Cusmano) said                     this impressive,  unforgettable sentence in his  preaching,  \"God  is  omnipotent,                     but prayer  is  the  most omnipotent!\"(sic). (Vol. 45, pages l55-l57).","8. His teaching                              We  glean from the Father's teaching,  explaining first  the nomenclature.  The                     authors distinguish between mental prayer and vocal  prayer.  The Father follows                     the classical  term  \"prayer,\" used by Saint Theresa and Saint John of the Cross,                     and subdivides it into 'prayer' and 'meditation.'                          Discussing  both  of  them,  he writes  these  unforgettable words,                           For   the   Christian   and  religious   life,   prayer   is indispensable; it is made                     of prayer and meditation.                          Our  Lord  grants  his  grace  through  prayer.    He    said,    \"Pray,  and  you  will                     receive; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be   opened  to  you.\"  The                     theologians  teach  that  prayer  is absolutely necessary for our eternal salvation,                     because none can be  saved  without prayer.  To stimulate us  to  pray,  our  Lord                     pledged  his  word,  assuring  us of the infallible  efficacy  of prayer,  i.e.,  we'll                     obtain  from  his  divine  Heart  what  is necessary for us to live and die saintly.                          Indispensable  and  effective as it is,  prayer  depends  on meditation. That the                     prayer's  efficacy  depends  on  meditation  is  a  truth  to  be  taken  into  serious                     consideration.  Meditation makes a person  understand the necessity of grace and                     compels  her  to    ask  for  it;  it  makes  one  understand  how  much  God  deserves   403                     worship and love,  urging  the person to stay in the divine presence in order to                     implore love,  forgiveness,  and graces;  it makes the  person understand her own                     nothingness and human failings, drawing her to implore  mercy  and salvation.                     The meditation on Jesus  Christ's mysteries inflames the soul with holy wishes of                     seeking,  loving, pleasing, and owing Jesus (Vol. l, page 25).                           Elsewhere the Father insists,                           Based on the word of God, on the teaching of the Fathers and of the Church,                     as well as on experience, the holy writers always held  prayer so necessary to                     progress in holy perfection   as  to conclude  that  no  one neglecting prayer may                     achieve  any  solid virtue.                          Prayer   draws   enlightenments  to  the  spirit   for   the understanding  and                     disliking of one's own miseries;  infuses  the holy fear of God;  enlightens the                     soul about the eternal  truths; makes her communicate with God;  fosters faith,                     hope,  and draws the  heart to divine love.   A person who does not pray is like a                     barren,    cursed  land.  On  the  contrary,  a  person  fond  of  prayer  is  like  a  land                     watered by the dew of grace (S.C. Vol. l0, page l85).","The  Father exhorts her daughters to meditation,  submitting three  reasons        to                     them.      \"I  heartily  exhort    the    Daughters    of  Divine    Zeal    to  be  fond  of                     meditation,    because  it  is    the    main  preparation    to    receive    Communion                     worthily,   and  because  it nurtures  the  spirit of effective prayer to win any                     grace  from God;  furthermore,  meditation  prompts  the  soul to  reach  the                     highest perfection\" (Vol. l, page 27).                          We do not dwell at length on the Father's meditation method, which   is   Saint                     Alphonsus':        preparation,      consideration,  affections,  prayers,  and  resolves.                     Rather, we recall  his remarks on distractions during the meditation, especially                     the involuntary ones.                           However,    the    people  must  know  that  they  may  be  responsible  for    the                     distractions  that  enter.    No  one  can    say,    'I    am    not  responsible.'  In  fact,                     distractions mainly come in because we are not mortified or dead to ourselves.                          It    is  worse  when  distractions  arise  because  of  our  previous  dissipation,                     which  originates  from  talking  vainly,   having attachments,   and   the  like.                     Usually    the    chief    cause      of  distractions  during  meditation  is  attachment,                     because the object or  the  people  to whom we are attached come  to  our  mind.                     If opposed and rejected,  these distractions are involuntary in act, but voluntary                     in  cause,  but  dispelling  them  is  harder,    however,  because  of  their  voluntary                     cause.    A  mortified,    diligent    person  seldom  undergoes  distractions  during                     meditation, and when it does happen she dispels them easily.                              404                          Hence,  everyone  will  deduce how much she  must  humiliate herself  before                     God because of the distractions which  interfere with  meditation;   even though                     there is no sin in act  when  she regrets,  retracts, and condemns the causes, still                     she must plead guilty before God.  Retracting the cause of distractions is truly                     sincere  when  the  soul amends her attachments  and   the  daily dissipation  as                     well  as devotes herself  to  mortification  and exercise of holy humility (Vol. l,                     page 34).                           Here  there  are additional remarks by the  Father.                           If  we  often meditated on the truths of faith,  if we  were often in the divine                     presence,  if we were fond of prayer,  if  we prayed  for  hours,  if we were fully                     aware  of  the    mysteries    of  faith  in  our  actions  all  day  long,  what  mutations                     would happen in us! Bit by bit,  a ray of God's infinite splendor would enter us,                     our mind would be filled with divine light, and darkness would be driven  away.                     Through  divine light we would know how  to  abhor evil,  how to embrace well,                     while a celestial fire would inflame our heart and move our will effectively.  If                     we  persevered  in  the  exercise  of  meditation,  we  would  become  holy.  On  the                     contrary, if we  are  cool and  attached to many things,  if our passions  are alive,                     if our mind is dull,  if we are lacking virtues,","all this is due to our lack of meditation.  We do not nurture our  spirit, and  it                     becomes exhausted;  we deny ourselves the bread of  life, and  it always remains                     as faint as dying;  the spirit's eyes  are blind,  its ears are deaf, its palate does not                     savor the taste of the celestial things any longer.  Thus, while the starving spirit                     declines,  the  body boldly takes over.  In short,  if we do  not become spiritual,                     it is because of our lack of meditation\" (Vol. 24, page l26).                           About  the  use of health reason as a pretext to  leave  out meditation, the                     Father recommends,                           No    one  will  leave  out  the  morning  meditation  without  having  a    reason                     approved  by  the  authority.    The  health    reason    excuses  from    doing    the                     meditation only when it implies a danger  or  a serious inconvenience.  For the                     sake of interests,  people in the world  sometimes  work even when they are sick                     or  feverish,  at their  own  risk.  And God helps them because  they  are  parents                     earning  the bread for their children,  or employees doing  their duties, or laborers                     working for their masters. If by obedience we spare  ourselves  when we are sick                     or feverish,  at least let  us take  care  of never leaving out meditation  for  cheap                     excuses, which  can be considered serious by suggestion of the devil or by our                     bad nature (S.C. Vol. l0, page l80).                                                                                                               405                      9. Necessity and efficacy of prayer                              Speaking of prayer, the Father insists on its necessity.                          \"Prayer  is  necessary  because  our Lord  grants  no  grace without  prayer.                     The sacred writers say that prayer is  as  much necessary  for  spiritual  life  as                     breath is  for  natural  life because prayer is the breath of the soul\" (Vol.  L,  page                     58). He calls  upon  the saints' examples:  \"The saints  were  wisest  in profiting                     by this great means.  To be saved,  to improve  heroic virtues,  to  conquer  and                     throw down  any  inordinate  passion, overcome  any difficulty,  prevail over                     hell,    sanctify  and    save  innumerable  souls,    and  work  striking  wonders,    the                     saints prayed continuously.  They cooperated by hard work and sacrifices.  Work                     and  sacrifices,  however,  would  have been of no value  without fervent  and                     continuous  prayer.  Both the  uselessness  of  our efforts  and the necessity of                     prayer for our  sanctification  are pointed out by these words of our Lord Jesus                     Christ,  'You can do nothing without me' (Jan.  l5,","5). It is obvious that we can do no good   for  ourselves  and  others  without  the                     help  and   the enlightenment  of  our  Lord,  but we can obtain  this  help  and                     enlightenment by praying\" (Vol. l, page 58).                           \"Prayer is also as necessary as it is effective.                           This  is  a consoling truth,  because if we pray with faith, fervor,  and due                     dispositions our prayer reaches  God,  obtaining  what we ask for.                           This  certainty  is based on this promise of our Lord  Jesus Christ,  'Ask,  and                     you  will  receive;    seek,    and  you  will    find;  knock,    and  the  door  will  be                     opened to you' (Mt.  7,  7). He also  narrated  the  parable of the friend knocking                     at a friend's  door and asking for three loaves (Lk.  all, 5-8) as well as the parable                     of  the  widow  who  got justice from an  unjust  judge  who  was reluctant to do                     so (Lk.  l8,   l-8).  On another occasion  he  said, 'Would  any of  you who are                     Fathers give your son a snake when  he asks for fish?  Or would you give him a                     scorpion when he asks for an egg?  As bad as you are,  you know how to give                     good things  to your  children.  How much more,  then,  the Father in heaven will                     give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him' (Lk. all, ll-l3)!                           Besides,  he  solemnly  said,  'I  tell  you  the  truth:  the  Father  will  give  you   406                     whatever  you  ask  of  Him  in  my  name.    Until  now    you  have  not  asked  for                     anything in my name; ask and you will receive, so that your happiness may be                     complete' (Jan.  l6, 23-24). 'If you ask  me  for anything in my name,  I will do it'                     (Jan.    l4,    l4).        Given  all  these  solemn  promises,  who  can  doubt  about  the                     prayer's divine efficacy?  Who can doubt that the Lord hears us?  Is there any                     excuse for those who get no graces for lack of prayer?\" (Vol. l, page 59).                        10. Absolute trust in prayer                              The  Father lived these truths so deeply as to bind  himself by vow (ch.  6,  no.                     l0)  to  believe  that  through  prayer  the  Lord  would  hear  him  in  spite  of  any                     difficulty or opposition.                          He always exhorted people to resort to prayer. \"Let us pray!","Let  us do some penance because the times are growing  dark.  May God  protect                     and save us\" (Vol.  3l,  page 58).  \"Let us trust in constant prayer with the purest                     intention\" (Vol.  32,  page ll4). \"Let  us pray with firm trust that right,  constant                     prayer    never  fails\"  (Vol.    35,    page  7l).  \"Let  us  pray,  let  us  pray;  prayer  is                     omnipotent!\"    (Vol.    35,    page  7l).    \"Let  us    pray    continuously.  Constant,                     humble, trustful, and pure prayer is infallible\" (Vol. 36,  page  62).  He wrote to a                     mother superior,  \"Consult in your prayer  our Lord and the most holy Virgin,                     making up your  mind\" (Vol.  36, page l49). \" If you want to become a saint, be                     fond  of  prayer,  especially  of  meditation  on  the  Passion  of  our  Lord.  Love  so                     much Jesus,  because  love teaches and does everything\"  (Vol. 34,  page 35).                     \"Humble,    devout,    perseverant,    right,    trustful  prayer    with    living  interest                     penetrates heaven and  obtains  any grace.  In  spite  of inevitable difficulties,                     God's    help    will  prevail\"  (Vol.  39,  page  6).  Informing  the  communities  of  a                     chance to open a house in Padua, he wrote, \"As we use in any enterprise, we                     premise proper prayers to avoid that our sins turn  back  the apparition  of  divine                     mercy.  We ask  the divine spirit and  the most holy Virgin to enlighten and guide                     us, making us succeed for the greater glory of God,  the good of souls, and the                     consolation of the most holy Heart of Jesus\" (Vol. 34, page 94).                           \"Humble,      constant,    perseverant    prayer    along    with    good  behavior,                     observance, and pure intention obtains everything from divine kindness\" (Vol.             407                     39,  page  46).  \"The  probationer  must    base  on  the  spirit  of  prayer  his  hope  of                     improving  his  love  for  Jesus.  If    the  great  means  of  prayer  is  well  used,                     everything  will  go well;  the  lack of prayer instead makes the source of grace                     dry, while everything dies out.  God forbid it>\" (S.C.  Vol.  l0, page l66).  \"He                     wrote  very many prayers and poems  to  the  Madonna, Jesus, and the saints. As                     soon as a saint was canonized, he wrote prayers  and  hymns for him.  Every time                     his communities were  in need,  he  wrote  plenty of warm prayers which  flowed                     from  his ardent heart,  and the communities said them.  In these writings, his                     profound  faith  and  total  surrender  in  God  stand  out. Remembering  the                     troubles which threatened the institution  with death,  the Father recalled that in                     such cases,  the only  resort was prayer.  \"My son,  in those circumstances we                     had to appeal to our Lord through prayer; there was no other means.\" \"The only                     way to  reach  our Lord and to be united with him is  deep  humility, pure faith,                     mortification, and the spirit of prayer.\"                           Generic  prayers  from  the books were not  enough  for  the Father;  he liked                     specific ones.  For instance,  when the Morning Star Sisters were searching for a                     fitting house, he exhorted them \"to  say","special prayers to our Lord.  I  say  special,  meaning prayers fitting to your case,                     because  those  from  devotional  books  aren't.    I    followed  this  system  for  over                     forty years to form  my pious  institution,  and  divine kindness  blessed  it.  I                     wrote  special    prayers    for    each  circumstance,    following    the    divine                     inspiration\" (Vol. 39, page 30). And he insists, \"We obtained the graces  by dint                     of prayers and novenas written on  purpose.  Your holy  founder  (Sister  M.                     Luisa)  once    wrote    to    me,    \"In    any  circumstance  we  have  experienced  the                     miracles of prayer, and I am a witness\" (Vol.39, page 37).                          The various circumstances, or needs, are the occasion of the Father's  many                     prayers.  For  instance,  he  wrote  them  to  achieve  his  own    conversion,                     sanctification,  and  the virtues of  humility, detachment, and zeal; the conversion                     of souls and the institute's progress; as well as to overcome difficulties, avoid                     dangers, and be freed from divine punishments;  or for the needs of the Church                     and  the  world.  Specifically,  he  wrote  numerous,  ardent  prayers  to  win  good                     workers to the most holy Church,  and to make the Rogate triumph,  which was                     his passion. We agree with Father Vitale, who writes, \"Perhaps, it is not a great                     over-statement to say that he wrote a prayer every day...  In the hardest times, he                     engaged the help  of all paradise,  so to speak\"(2) (Father Mary Hannibal  Di                     Francia, page 292).                          A  theologian remarks,  \"His prayers are original.  Some  of them  are quite                     long  and  developed  in  a  simple,    personal    style,  which  reflects  the  author's   408                     living, pious sentiments.\"                          Prayers and practices of piety were established for each day of the week: on                     Sunday, for the most holy Trinity; on Monday, for the souls in purgatory;  on                     Tuesday,  for the guardian angel  and Saint Anthony;  on Wednesday,  for Saint                     Joseph; on Thursday, for the Blessed Sacrament and Saint Louis;  on Friday, for                     the Sacred Heart; on Saturday, for the most holy Virgin.                          It    was  likewise  for  the  months:      January  was  dedicated    to  the  Name  of                     Jesus,  and  ended  with  a  solemn  novena  and  a  petition.  In  February,    we                     celebrated the feasts of Our Lady of Lourdes and the  sacred  tongue of Saint                     Anthony of Padua;  in  March,  Saint Joseph;   in  April,   the  Sacred  Face.                     May  and  June  were  respectively  dedicated  to the most holy Virgin and  the                     Sacred Heart with preaching, mortifications, and offering of the hearts; July, to                     the most Precious Blood. In August, we had the feasts of Assumption  and  Saint                     Anthony’s","birth;   in   September,   the Bambinella,  Our Lady in sorrow,  Our Lady of La                     Salette, and Our Lady  of  Mercy;  in October,  the holy rosary and  the  guardian                     angels;  in  November,  the  souls  in  purgatory;  in  December, Immaculate                     Mary  and  Christmas.    Now  and  then  during  the  year,  the  communities      had                     vigils  on  the  eve  of  feasts  to   prepare themselves,  or to impetrate God's                     mercy on the institute and the world.                       11. Particular cases                              Besides  the prayers by rule on holidays,  the Father  wrote quite  a  few ones                     for specific solemnities,  or  for  particular cases. He  wrote,                           \"The liturgical feasts are also acceptable times for prayer. Just  as the kings of                     this world are more favorably  disposed  to grant  favors on their saint’s day or                     on the anniversary of their  coronation  and victories,  so the adorable Lord Jesus                     Christ  is  more   disposed  to  hear us in the days set   to  commemorate  the                     mysteries    and  the  triumphs  of  his  divine  love  for  human    beings.  The  same                     happens to the most holy Virgin Mary,  the  angels,  and the saints on the days of                     their feasts.                                                                             409                           Hence,    we    shall  profit  by  these  solemnities    by    appealing  humbly    and                     confidently with petitions and prayers in order    to obtain  what  we need;  these                     favorable opportunities  cannot  be missed\" (Vol.  L,  page 75).                           And  the  Father  missed no one,  as we see  from  his  many petitions.  He                     confidently appealed to the Lord, the Madonna, the angels,  and  the saints to be                     generous with graces and blessings for him,  the institute, the Church, and the                     world on the days of their feasts.                           For  the  Father,    prayer  was  the  universal  remedy.  He  taught:  \"On  every                     occasion, circumstance, peril, and need, we must resort to prayer,  because it is                     the golden key opening the treasure  of the  divine graces and mercies.\" He also                     reminds the  institute's members of the practice of the six novenas.","When  we  find ourselves in such circumstances,  usually  we resort  to the                     following six novenas:  to the most holy Heart  of Jesus,  the  most holy Virgin                     under the most  appropriate  title, Saint  Joseph,  Saint  Michael the archangel,                     Saint  Anthony  of Padua, and a special prayer to all souls.                          If we say two or three novenas, it can take nine or eighteen or twenty seven                     days,  depending on how many of them we say daily in the morning, at noon, and                     in the evening. For an urgent grace, we  may  say  the  novena in  three days by                     reciting  it  three  times    a  day.  For  a  most  urgent  grace,  we  may  complete  the                     novena in a day by reciting it nine times in the same day (Vol. l, page 78).                           In  connection with these prayers,  the most holy Virgin was usually  invoked                     as Immaculate,  but the Father had also  written specific  novenas  to  her  under                     the  title  of  Our  Lady  of: \"Perpetual  Help,\"  \"Miracles,\" \"Good Counsel,\"                     \"Sacred    Letter,\"  and  \"Quick  Hearer  in  urgent  and  desperate  cases\"  (Vol.    7,                     pages 42,  l30,  l65,  l5l).  The  title  was chosen according  to  the circumstance.                          Privately, the Father often recommended having recourse to                     Our  Lady of Good Counsel,  especially to fulfill well one's  own duty.                           \"When  one finds herself in doubt or  perplexity,  besides calling  upon Jesus'                     name she should resort to the Mother of Good Counsel,  by saying for instance,                     'Mother  of  Good    Counsel,    for  Jesus'    sake,    your  beloved  son,    please    410                     enlighten me on  how  to behave,  how  to  resolve,' or the like.  The invocation                     to    the  Mother    of    Good  Counsel  has  been  always  effective  beyond    belief                     because it opens even the dullest minds\" (Vol. l, page l24).                           During the war,   the Father pilgrimage to the sanctuary   of Our  Lady   of                     Bread in Novoli (Lecce).  At his  coming  back,  he ordered  the community to                     add  a Hail Mary to the prayers  before and  after meal.  He wished \"each house                     to have a picture of  her exposed  in  the  kitchen so that bread never fails,  due                     to  her motherly  kindness.\"   This  title  was  also  a  remembrance  of Melanie,                     who  dwelled  several years in the province  of  Lecce, becoming  fond  of that                     title.  \"You should know  that  our  dear Melanie  had  a  special devotion to Our                     Lady  of  Bread.  Before leaving, she left a picture in our mill so that Our Lady of                     Bread  ever  provides  us  with  bread.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  thanks  to  divine                     providence,  bread never failed us, even in the hard times\" (Vol. 34, page l24).","12. The prayer of the heart                             The  Father  counted  very much on  the  Church's  following formulas of                     prayer, and recommended them warmly: Our Father, Hail Mary,  Glory  to be,                     Requiem,  and the daily rosary,  which  our communities will never omit\" (Vol.                     L, page 86); the prayers from Scripture,  especially  the psalms;  the prayers from                     the missal, and  the Litany of the Saints.  But he insisted on  the  personal prayer,                     which is not bound to fixed formulas, rather it flows out of the heart enamored of                     God: the prayer of the heart.                           The most effective prayer  is the one coming from the heart. The  person  who                     is skilled in  mental  prayer,  meditation,  and mortification;  the  person feeling                     the  love  of  Jesus  along    with  his  Heart's  interests;  the  person  zealous    for                     knowing  and  loving  Jesus,  feeling  compassion  and  ardent  zeal  for  souls;    this                     person who  is dedicated to virtue and sacrifice,  needs no formulas  of prayer,                     because  the Spirit,  dwelling in her,  makes her  groan inexpressibly (Rom.  8,                     26).  To obtain divine graces for divine glory and salvation of all,  she will pray                     with  lively  ardor    and  will    annihilate    herself  before  God  and  Jesus'  divine                     presence, kissing  his  adorable feet and looking at the  supreme  goodness with                     most tender trust. Beautiful, wise, loving, convincing words will  come  from  her                     heart  longing for  the  Heart  of  Jesus' interests,  winning the graces, which the      411                     world does not deserve. Tears  will well up in your eyes,  and sighs from the                     heart,  as from a fountain.  To better  touch the Heart of her divine spouse and                     win  graces for God's glory and salvation  of  souls,  which would seem almost                     impossible  to  obtain,    this  person  will  combine  her    ardent  prayers  with  her                     effusive and diffusive  thanksgiving for the graces that the Lord has granted,  is                     granting,  and will grant to everyone.  Kneeling down with hands raised to the                     sky  or  to    the  crucifix  or  to  the  holy  tabernacle,    she  will  be    as    the  priest,                     between    the    vestibule  and  the    altar,    moistening    the  ground  with  tears,  if                     necessary.                          Her  prayer  will  become one with our Lord  Jesus  Christ's divine prayer;  the                     wails of her soul will be the wails of  Jesus in solitude,  in the caves,  on the                     mountains;  her sighs will be the  sighs and the prayers of Jesus suffering in his                     Passion from the garden to the cross,  up to the loud cry when he breathed his                     last;  her  prayers will be the divine petitions  that  God,  the eternal  pontiff                     hidden in the Holy Sacrament,  repeats  for  us until the end of time.                          When  this  person  who  is  united  with  Jesus  through  meditation  and    the                     sacrifice  of  herself  is  obliged  by  obedience  or    common  life    to  interrupt  her                     prayer,    with  all  her  heart    she  will  make  her  time  and  actions  an  actual  or                     habitual prayer; the night will be   also  a  suitable  time for her to  pray  more                     ardently  and passionately  in union with Jesus,  and even while  sleeping  she                     will  pray","in union with Jesus,   at least intentionally and  by protestation and desire.                           No  one but God knows the graces this person wins  from  the adorable Heart                     of Jesus, in favor of the holy Church, the pilgrim souls,  the souls who are in                     purgatory,  and the whole world.  No one but God knows how much her prayer                     pleases the most holy Heart of  Jesus.  It  was to  this praying person that the                     Holy  Spirit spoke  in the words of the celestial spouse,  \"The flowers appear on                     the  earth...  the cooing of the turtledove is heard  in  our land...  Come then, my                     love, my lovely one, come. My dove, hiding in  the clefts  of the rock,  in the                     coverts of the cleft  of  the rock  let me hear your voice;  for your voice is sweet\"                     (Songs 2, l2-l4).  \"The voices coming from the heart,  longing for my glory and                     for goodness of souls are utterances of paradise.\"                           Even  when this person forgets herself in the prayer to  the most holy Heart of                     Jesus' interests, she will leave her prayer in a  holier state than before,  sharing                     the good she has  obtained for  souls,  the divine glory she has caused,  and the                     celestial consolations  she  has given the beloved Heart of Jesus.  I  wish such                     souls  were  in  all communities that  are  consecrated  to Jesus> (Vol. l, page 87).                        L3.  Examination of conscience                                                            412                             and spiritual reading                              Examination  of  conscience and spiritual reading are  among the practices of                     piety particularly neglected today, much to Paul VI's regret. For the Father, they                     were indispensable and powerful means of sanctification.                           If    even  the  slightest  sin  is  to  be    hated,    examination    of  conscience  is                     indispensable.  The  Father  wants  his  children  \"to  be  aware    of  the  slightest                     imperfection,  mindful of the sayings  of our  Lord,  'You  must  be  perfect as                     your  heavenly  Father  is perfect' (Mt.  5, 48). 'I assure you, on judgment day                     people will be  held accountable for every unguarded word they  speak'\"  (Mt. l2,                     36).  Talking  about  the  examination  of  conscience,  the  Father  insists    with                     practical examples on rooting out the  faults  and their habit:","Oh! if the Lord  enlightened us to perceive and define our sins  and our                     light imperfections as they really are,   how  many roots  of hidden passions we                     would discover in  ourselves!  Hence the necessity of making a very accurate                     examination of conscience with recollection and divine enlightenment, instead of                     making it on the surface, as some do! (Vol. l, page l6).                           Since   it is an   important factor of   sanctification, spiritual reading will be                     always in force in our houses. When the people listen to it in silence with interior                     and exterior quiet, they seem to be meditating.   Spiritual reading may be public                     or private.                           Successful spiritual reading is like a beneficial, gentle rain which irrigates the                     soul, penetrates the heart sweetly, and spreads wide inside the person to her great                     pleasure and profit. In the meditation one may not always be able or disposed to                     attract the stream of grace in a sensible way, or she has to make many efforts; in                     spiritual reading instead, the soul receives the sweet stream of grace passively                     and specifically.  To profit by it, each one must be attentive, as if Jesus himself                     were  speaking  to  her  with  the  words  of  that  book;  in  fact,  any  good  spiritual                     reading is from God.                           Treating  of  the  private  spiritual  reading,  the  Father suggests,  \"If  you     413                     happen   to feel drawn to   meditate   on   some specific passage while reading,                     please do it because it will  be helpful.\" (Vol. l, pages 90-9l).                        14. Exhortation                             At the closure of this very important chapter on prayer,  we remind  you  of                     Paul VI's exhortation to the Religious.  \"Do not forget the experience of history:                     faithfulness to prayer is the religious   life's vitality;   lack of prayer,   its decline\"                     (Evangelica testificatio, no. 42).                          This grave warning from the Pope is a beforehand comment  on the  Father's                     vibrant  and  sad  exhortation,    whose  words  should  be  engraved  in  each  of  his                     children's mind and heart.  The Father’s following trenchant introduction,   \"The                     padre  talks  to  his  daughters  in  Jesus  Christ,\"  calls  our  attention  on  the                     importance that the Father annexed to his following words:                           You along with the future Daughters of Divine Zeal must know and keep in                     mind that this Pious Institute of the Heart of Jesus' interests, along","with    the    two    religious    communities,      the  orphanages  and  the  institutions,                     originated,  improved,  and was formed  through  prayer;  especially through the                     prayer  and  the yearly  petition  we presented to the eternal Father in the  most                     holy  name  of  Jesus  in  January,    believing  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ's  divine,                     ineffable  promises.    Through  such  petitions  we  asked  the  divine,    infinite                     goodness for special graces of  sanctification and formation in the Lord for this                     pious institute;  we asked the kingdom  of God along with its justice,  basing our                     faith on  our Lord  Jesus  Christ's merits of infinite value,  on   his  divine word,                     and    also  on  the  most  holy  Virgin,    the    angels,    and    the  saints'  powerful                     intercession.                          We point out that the prayers we have made in any time and circumstance,                     especially  during  the  mass,  the  feasts,  and  embarrassing  situations  were                     accompanied by the conditions we have talked about in this detailed chapter.  In                     the same time, we have endeavored to combine the works with prayer, avoiding                     even the least venial sin by deliberate assent.  We have done our best  to help                     our    neighbor    spiritually  and  corporeally  for    God's    sake  only,    always                     imploring  good  workers for the  holy  Church  in compliance with our special                     mission,  besides practicing  various spiritual  industries.  Thus,  divine  mercy                     bent down toward this small grain, blessed it, looked favorably at the poor of his                     divine Heart and said, \"Grow and multiply!\"                          The community is bound in duty to keep in mind such things, knowing that             414                     when  the  untarnished  faith  in  prayer,  in  the  yearly  petition,  in  the  spiritual                     industries grows feeble, God forbid! When the vision of the pure, right intention                     grows dim, God forbid! When the spiritual industries are neglected, God forbid!                     When even the least deliberate defect does not matter,  then  the door  is  open  to                     the devil,  who will come in  to  ravage  the sheepfold!  Disgusted,  God will                     withdraw  his    grace,    will    stop  looking    favorably  at  this  pious  institute,    to                     which he has been so loving and giving so many benefits,  holding it as his own                     no longer.  On the contrary, he will become indignant at it, because the more he                     benefits  and  cherishes  an  institute  or  a  community,  the  more  he  becomes                     indignant at it when it becomes unfaithful! Then,  everything  will  go to ruin:                     what has been built for  so long,  even  for centuries,  will fall down decaying in                     a    short  while,    as  unluckily  happened  to  so  many  institutes  once  holy  and                     blooming in the holy Church.                          The  superiors,  above  all,  will pay careful attention  to avoid  slackening  in                     the  communities  by    maintaining    observance  along  with  the  exercise  of  holy                     virtues, by strongly opposing the least deliberate defect,  and by dismissing the                     people who  offer no  hope.   They will be also watchful in order to prevent false                     vocations from entering the community.  Let us pray that the Lord give us the                     people of true vocation, whose hearts are with Jesus, whose  thoughts are turned                     to Jesus,  and whose minds  understand the Heart of Jesus' interests,  their own                     sanctification, and the salvation of others as well! (Vol. l, pages 88-90).","Notes                         (l)    The  works  by  Saint  John  of    the    Cross    expound    his  spiritual  canticles  and,                     unintentionally,  manifest his mystical experiences.  Alive  Flame  of  Love  interprets a                     poem  of  four strophes, \"which is the shortest of his chief works, but the most overflowing                     with light and fire\" (S. Giovanni Della Croce, Opera, Postulazione Generale dei Carmelitani                     Scalzi,  Roma - Pref.  page XII). It discusses the supreme mystical state that we can have on                     earth.    The  saint  acknowledges,  \"These  strophes  contain  intimate,  spiritual    things,    for                     which the common language is  inadequate. After  experiencing some loath in manifesting                     them,  now  I  take courage  to write them because the Lord enlightened my  intellect and                     infused  fervor  to  me\" (Ibid.  page  785).  Here  are  the strophes:                                    Living flame of love                                   That sweetly wound                                   The soul at its innermost center;                                   Since you are not a shy dove                                   Finish the work, make it crooned,                                   And break the cloth with your encounter.

The flame of charity                               What is zeal all about?  Saint Francis of Sales defined it, \"The  fervor  of                     charity.\"  What    a    beautiful    definition    When  charity    burns,    it    cannot  be                     contained in the heart,  its  fire breaks out,  and its flames spread widely.  Holy                     love for  others cannot be idle, but needs to work in order to impede the people's                     ruin, to avoid dangers of persons, and to snatch the innocent out  of  idleness,                     dissipation,   moral  and  civil  ruin.   Charity transforms  itself into zeal\" (Vol.                     25,  page 59).  So says  the Father,  who also writes,  \"Love of God bursting and                     going  beside  itself  is  called  zeal:  zeal  which  desires  to  sacrifice  itself  for  the                     glory of God and the salvation of souls\" (Vol. 45, page 347).      More  in detail:                     \"Charity produces in itself the fervor and  the flame  which rise up to God,  and                     draw from God's love and  glory the reasons to work more intensely on earth.                     Charity brings about zeal for God's glory and the souls' salvation; it substitutes                     the world's selfishness with altruism  by involving the people in the work for the                     good of others.  They work continuously for God, for the truth,  for the good of                     their neighbor, and because  they are unable to embrace the whole world with                     their action,  they suffer for the evil which overflows in society\" (Vol. 45, page                     l2l).                                                                                     418                           Such was the Father's life.  As the prophet Elijah, he could say of himself,  \"I                     have been most zealous for the Lord,  the God of hosts, but the Israelites have                     forsaken your covenant\" (l Kgs. l9,  l0).  For  this  reason,  he commissioned for                     his church  in Messina the painting of Elijah transferred by a car of fire. Also the                     final    names    of  his  congregations,    which    he    chose    after  several  years  of                     prayer,    reflect  his  blazing  zeal.    Rogationists  is  a  word  from  Rogate.  \"If  we                     consider these divine words, we see that they are  a manifestation of the divine                     zeal of the heart of Jesus,  who  repeated them many times according to  Saint                     Luke's phrase,  \"he used to say\" (Lk.  l0,  2). It is not \"he said,\" but rather,  \"he                     used to say\" indicating habitual action meaning that the  divine","zeal  never  got  tired  of  urging  man  to  pray  for    this  goal.  Given  all  this,  the                     Evangelical Rogation can be paraphrased as  the  command  of  the  divine zeal                     in  the  heart  of  Jesus. Consequently,  the  sisters'  house is called the  \"Institute                     of Divine Zeal\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page lll).                          In the sisters' ancient regulations,  the Father pointed out that  the apostolic                     zeal of the institute chiefly resides in  the zeal for Rogate.                           Zeal   is   the   virtue  that  seeks   divine   glory   and sanctification of souls.                     Due to human failings, no one is able to encompass all  the objects of a virtue on                     the same time,  but  we are obliged to apply the virtue to particular objects in                     order  to  practice  it  as  completely  as  perfectly.  In  our  case,  which  is  the  best                     object for the zeal of the Poor of the Holy Heart of Jesus, who takes the vow to                     foster divine glory and salvation of  souls? The  object  will  be:  winning good                     workers to the  holy  Church through  prayer and cooperation. This object                     summarizes the  best of everything to foster divine glory and salvation of souls.                     The reason  is that the power and the mission of glorifying  God  and saving                     souls  has  been  entrusted  by  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  to    the  good    evangelical                     workers,  who are the priests.  He said to  the apostles,  \"As the Father has sent                     me,  so I send you.\" Now,  our Lord Jesus Christ's mission and his redemption                     aim at God's glory and  our  salvation,  which form the mission and the aim  of                     the Church's  ministers.  To  fulfill this mission,  God  endows  His priests  with a                     particular power and grace:  when they answer the Lord's call  faithfully,  no one        419                     is able to value the glory  they give  to God and the good they cause to souls.                     Who may value the beneficial  effects  of one  faithful  priest's  ministry?  These                     mysteries  of  grace  will be valued at the  judgment  day  only. Considering  how                     much glory one divine mass gives to God and  how much  good  it  causes  to so                     many souls  is  enough  to  somehow understand  the importance of one priest                     who says mass every day. If  we consider the whole ministry of a priest,  we may                     conclude that  a  good priest is a glorifier of the Lord and a  savior  of souls:  it  is                     like Jesus Christ himself who gives  the  eternal Father  what  is  due to his divine                     love  by  saving  souls  from eternal death                          Hence we realize that the best, surest, and easiest means to seek  God's glory                     and salvation of souls is winning good  priests to the holy Church,  because this                     is the shortest,  surest way to reach  God's glory and salvation of souls,  which is                     the goal  of the people who are enflamed by zeal (Vol. 3, page 82).                           Writing  for    the  Rogationists,    he  gives  prominence  to    the  necessity  of                     combining cooperation with prayer.                           While  praying to God that he may fill the holy  Church  and the  world with                     good evangelical workers,  the congregants of our least institute","will  strive  with  ardent  zeal  and  sacrifice  to    be  good  evangelical  workers                     themselves in the Lord's harvest.  I see this duty as the immediate,  legitimate                     consequence  which  derives  from  the    appreciation,    from  the  untiring  culture,                     and from the meditation  on  the divine Rogate as well as from  the  limitless                     obedience and from the faithful execution of this command.                           As a consequence of all this,  I will never spare myself  in the   work  for  the                     Lord's  glory  and  the  souls'  salvation, considering myself unfaithful,  lazy,  and                     indifferent when I  am not thirsty for souls.  Therefore, I will excite in myself                     hunger and  thirst for souls through meditation,  fervent prayer,  work, and  self-                     denial.  But,  whether I feel or whether I do not  feel this hunger and thirst for                     souls, with God's help and my constant determination  I will never stop working                     in the mystical  harvest of souls.                           To  fruitfully work for the sanctification and the salvation of others,  first I                     will endeavor to sanctify myself.  Keeping in mind  the saints' teaching that our                     Lord Jesus Christ  loves  one soul  as  much  as all souls together,  and that  he                     would  have endured  his  Passion even for one soul,  I will esteem souls  so                     much  as  to  spend  my  life  in  suffering,   in  working,  and sacrificing myself                     even for one soul (Vol. 3, page 22).                                                                                                               420                          This was the Father's teaching; now let us see how he practiced it.                         2. The generous offering                             First,  we  quote  the offer of his life to the Lord to  win from  his  mercy an                     apostle  who  would  regenerate  Messina    in    the  spirit  and  in  the  fervor  of  the                     Christian faith. It dates back to                     the early years of his priesthood: May 3, l880.                                                          OFFERING                           Eternal God,  creator and Lord of all things,  supreme owner of all creatures, I                     kneel down in the dust before you. I confess, praise,  bless,","and exalt your infinite goodness and your divine qualities.  My God, I would like                     to obliterate and to melt myself in the name of your glory,  but why don't I know                     how  to  love  you,  why  doesn't  everyone  love,    serve,  obey,  and  please  you?                     Everyone has  become  corrupt and useless;  not even one person  is  doing good.                          Lord,  make  all  people on earth confess  and  praise  your divine name.  In a                     special way I implore you for the sake of your Word to pay merciful attention to                     this city that could be called \"Merciless.\" Because you've made nations curable,                     bless and cure this  city;  you that make your ministers burning fire,  sanctify the                     city's priests.  My Lord and God  The salt of the earth  has become apathetic.                     The light has been placed under a bushel  The light  of  the  world has left  My                     God,  I wish to  practice  my priestly  ministry  among these people as Saint Paul                     did  in  the nations where the Holy Spirit brought him.                          First  of  all,  kneeling  before  you  in  ashes,  sackcloth,  while  fasting  and  in                     prayer, I wish crying would placate your anger and win  your  abundant mercies.                     I would like working by day and  by night  for   your  glory  through  study,                     preaching,  confession, attendance to the sick,  education of children,  and any                     means to win all souls by converting sinners and sanctifying the just.                          Alas  My wishes are like the wishes that kill the lazy  My God, what am I                     worthy of?  I am a useless tool.  Lord, send whom you  will  send.  Since you                     were able to bring  the  children  to Abraham even from the rocks, rouse in this          421                     city  a  faithful  priest  who  views  the  world  according  to  your  heart  From  the                     treasure  of  your    infinite  goodness  send  Messina  a  true  apostle  full  of    your                     blessing:  a pure,  chaste,  spotless, simple, meek, sober, just, prudent   priest,                     full  of  Holy   Spirit,   mercy,   strength, perseverance,   and  the  science  of  the                     saints.  Send  us  an apostle full of ecclesiastical and literary discipline so that he                     may  fulfill his sublime ministry for your glory in the worthiest way.                          My God,  I am speaking as a fool and an ignorant man; still, rouse this holy                     and learned priest,  order him to kill and eat as you did with Peter,  or to root out                     and plant, destroy and build, as you did with Jeremiah.                          Let him destroy Satan's kingdom and build your kingdom; make people know                     and  love  you,    reform  clergy,  educate  children,  guide  virgins,    console  the                     afflicted, pray for the souls in Purgatory. Shine  as  a sun through his example,                     work,  and preaching,  and throw  a net so vast that all souls may be won to your                     love.  My Jesus,  I beg you,  stir this priest, sanctify the other priests, always send                     out new,  holy,  learned priests to Messina, to other cities, to all the world.                          What  am I worthy of - me,  a  poor sinner?  If you want  my life  in  the                     place of the priest who works  according  to  your heart,  I  give it up right now.                     As miserable as it is,  I still offer my life.  In order that this offering may be                     worthy  before you, I join it with the sacrifice of infinite","value that your son made on earth and is renewed daily in the mass.                           O  very  merciful  Lord,   accept  this  offering.  Make  me disappear  from                     earth and make the desired apostle,  the faithful priest according to your heart,                     replace me.  Lord, send whom you will send.                           Yes,  my  God,  I implore you,  accept this exchange  of  my useless life: I                     retire, come to nothing, and give my place to the new one who will please and                     glorify you better than I can.                           Lord  God,  for  the sake of your holy begotten son  who  is thirsty for souls,                     hear my prayer. Have mercy on His very loving heart  that longs for holy priests.                     Hear not my prayer,  but the prayer,  vows,  wishes  of  the  divine heart  that                     pleases  you completely.                           My  God,  if you hear me,  I praise and thank you.  Full  of gratitude I say:                     you may let your servant go...                           Omnipotent God,  have mercy on the misery of your servant: I speak  as a                     fool;  forgive me.  Do as you like with my  offering. Praised  be  your will in                     which I want to be  engulfed.  My  God, glorify your will and your mercy. Amen.           422                     Long live JESUS and MARY (Vol. 4, page 3).                           So,  the  Father  offered his life to the Lord  to  win  the apostle  of  Messina.                     Is  there anything which hinders  us  from holding that the apostle of the Lord is                     the Father himself? If we search  for  a  \"pure,  chaste,  spotless,  simple,  meek,                     sober priest...  who educates children,  guides virgins,  consoles  the afflicted,                     prays  for  the souls in purgatory,  shines as a  sun through  his  example and                     works by day and by night for the  glory of  God;  who seeks to win all the souls                     through all  means,  the conversion of sinners and the sanctification of the  just,                     don't  we    find    such  an  apostle  in  our  Father  since  the  early  years    of  his                     priesthood?                           And  indeed,  he  was  an apostle even before  he  became  a priest.  It comes                     from the Rogationist prayer which is a practice of zeal. The Father began saying                     such a prayer since he was a lay man.  He  wrote,  \"The first zeal of a consecrated                     person is  for herself.  through  her zeal she will be strong enough  to  punish                     herself,  seeking her sanctification with a will\" (Vol.  l,  page 206).  Evidence of                     this  will,  is  the  Father's  life.  The  following  chapters  will  give  additional                     evidence.(l)","3. In Avignone                              It  was by zeal that the Father became a priest.  He says of himself,  \"At  the                     age  of l7,  he felt  himself  drawn  to  the priesthood in an extraordinary, or                     better  yet,    not  usual  way.  He  committed    himself    to  devotion,    aiming  at                     belonging totally  to Jesus and at winning souls for him\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 240).                           Commenting the Father's encounter with Zancone,  who  begged an alms from                     him,  Father  Vitale remarks,  \"When Padre  Di Francia  met  Zancone the first                     time,  our padre asked him where he lived, adding:  'I will come to see you and                     the  other  poor  people...'  He  meant,    'I    want    to    save    you  and    the    others                     intoxicated  by spiritual  and material vice'\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di  Francia,                     page 33l).                           So, the Father pledged to visit the Avignone Quarter to help those people, but                     he did not imagine the material and moral decay he had to face in that quarter                     having a shining,  historic  name. When  he found himself in the midst of that                     hell,  \"he  realized that  there  was no better place to practice a bit of charity  of                     pure   love for our Lord,  who loves so much the poor  and  wants them saved\"             423                     (Preface to Adhesions,  l9l9, page 5). It was not  a bit  of  charity.   Sure,  what                     we do for our Lord is  little  or nothing, but our poor nature needs heroic virtues                     to face certain situations.   This was the Father's case. He did not draw back in                     the presence of whatever difficulty,  but succeeded to  transform that place of                     vice into an oasis of virtue.                           Ordained a priest, the Father continued and widened the work he had started,                     pledging all his belongings.  He longed for  the salvation  of  souls,  and having                     found in the slums of  Avignone Quarter  poor people,  he had pity,  took  care,                     supported,  and educated them religiously.  Thus,  he began his marvelous work                     of evangelization  of the poor and the orphans,  whom  he  supported with his                     own goods and the help of others.                           The chief results of his zeal are the communities he founded and  educated  in                     the  virtue  and  love  of  God.    We    have    already  touched  upon  his  zeal  for                     catechism; now we quote from a sister's report.  \"When the Father visited the                     communities,  he seized any opportunity to preach the divine word twice or three                     times a  day in order to foster the virtues. He spoke of paradise, the saints'","episodes,  sacred  history,  very often of our Lord's  life,  the gospel,  the most                     holy Communion,  etc.  I never heard the Father speaking uselessly, but always                     edifyingly.\"                           We  have volumes of the Father's outlines of his  preaching, instructions, and                     retreats for our communities. But we'll discuss the  Father's  particular  zeal for                     his  children  in  particular chapters.                           The  zeal  tormenting  him  went beyond the  circle  of  his communities,                     because  he  displayed  a very  active  oratory  in Messina and its villages,  above                     all when he was a youth. Zealous as he was for the glory of God and the spiritual                     good of  people, the  Father used to present himself to the pastors of the  little                     towns,  made people peal the bells,  and preached to the faithful in the churches.                     His  favorite  theme  was  charity,  and  the  faithful  were    very    attentive    to  his                     preaching.  A mission  at  Avignone Quarter after the l894 earthquake is well                     remembered.  \"Wounded, dispersed,  and  perplexed,  people  went to Avignone                     Quarter  by themselves  or  in  procession.  The  Servant  of  God  preached,                     comforted  them,  and  said the litany of the  saints.  Even  the indifferent  and                     the  atheists  found guidance  in  his  words.\" Terrified  by the earthquake,  the                     pilgrims went over  there  and expiated  their sins after hearing the Servant of                     God's preaching with  unction.  Cardinal Guarino,  who was  paralyzed,  from                     his palace   blessed with his left hand the pilgrims coming from   the Father's           424                     preaching.                           Like his preaching, so his travels were for the glory of God and the good of                     souls. Either he sought vocations, or counsel, or comfort  in  the Servants of God,                     for  whose  conversation  he    was  thirsty;    either    he    traveled  to    approach                     benefactors,  or  to preach, or to do the works of charity, of which his heart  was                     so fond;  either  he  pilgrimaged  to sanctuaries,  or  visited  his communities,  his                     aim was the glory of God and the good of souls. He  assisted his communities                     with  preaching,  instructions,  and industries  of piety,  in which he was so  rich,                     always  solving problems and comforting all.  The more the houses increased,                     the  more he had to travel.   He visited the sanctuaries of Loreto,  Our Lady  of                     Good Counsel at Gennazzano,  Our Lady of Pompei (where he enjoyed Bartolo                     Longo's intimate friendship),  Our Lady Helper at Turin,  the sacred mount at                     Orta (Novara),  and the novitiate of Don Orione at Bra', where he preached.","4. Away with the Jonahs                              We  quote  from  the  Father's letter  \"to  the  institute's employees,  workers,                     and    the  people  who  are  helped  by  it.\"      He  exhorted  all  of  them  to  practice                     Christian life and to avoid sin under penalty of expulsion.  He uses a practical                     reasoning: if we do not live as good Christians, God will not give his providence                     to us,  the sheltered will lack bread, and the employees won't be paid.                           It  is  true  that  each one in  his  task,  as  myself  in different ways,  works to                     help  things  along,    but  everything  will  come    to  nothing  without  the  help  of                     divine  providence,  because God  keeps an eye on the human fortunes ruling and                     directing them according  to his supreme will.  He makes the sun rise  and   the                     earth  bloom,  gives rain and provides all creatures with things. But  if  we  forget                     God,  God will forget  us,  and  despite  our working, toiling around,  providence                     will not or hardly come.                           This is why I feel myself obliged to ask you to observe  the religious  duties                     as well as any other Christian  duty.  On  one hand,  you want me to give work to                     you, paying you for it; on the other  hand,  I  ask  you  not to  hinder  divine                     providence  by forgetting God,  because  if he does not give me the means,  I am                     unable  to pay and reward you according to your need or work;  if you do not              425                     comply with your duties toward God, with good reason I have fear of losing his                     means. This is my interest and yours.                           Besides,  your  religious duties are not intolerable burdens nor do I require of                     you great sacrifices, but religious acts that are very easy.  My dearest in Jesus                     Christ,  please consider that we are unable to stay in the grace of God,  unless we                     fulfill our religious duties.                           Living without confession,  holy Communion, and study of the main elements                     of our holy religion; living without lifting up our eyes  to  heaven to pray and                     adore God as our Lord  and  Creator;living  without considering our last end as                     well as  the  eternal destination,  this  is not a Christian living,  a living of God's                     creatures,    but  a  living  of  ungrateful  beings,    of  fools  who    run  the    risk    of                     getting  lost  for  ever.    By  forgetting  God  and  our  religious  duties  it  becomes                     unavoidable for us to fall into many sins                           This is both the rub of my worries and our common prejudice My  dearest,  I                     assure  you that I  fear  nothing,  and  nothing disheartens me in the proceeding                     of  these  charitable    institutes,  but  sin.    Want,  difficulties,  persecutions,  etc.                     everything seems like nothing, because I hope and trust in the Lord, who is a                     provident and loving Father.  But, if sin dwells among the people who live in the                     institutes, then I see everything lost","My dearest brothers and sisters, such a truth the Holy Spirit manifested in                     these words, “Virtue makes a nation great; by sin whole races are disgraced\"                     (Prov. l4, 34). Do you know why misery is reigning in the families, the families                     are  fading,  means  are  failing,  bankruptcies  are  common,  and  misfortunes  are                     increasing?    Because  of  sin  On  one  hand,  the  people  live  far  off  from    God,                     disregarding  the religious duties  and  adhering  to nothing but interest; on the                     other hand, God does not bless their business,  industries,  fields,  and work.  On                     one hand,  we make plans,  on  the other hand,  God makes them useless;  we                     collect money,  but  God  makes it disappear with no  profit.  In short, without                     the blessing of God, nothing goes on well; with the blessing of God, everything                     flourishes.                          God  does  not bless the people who disregard the  religious duties such as                     confession,  holy Communion,  preaching, religious education,  spiritual  reading,                     and  prayer in the  morning  and night.  The persons who live oblivious of God                     are too feeble to overcome temptations, internal and external sins, bad thoughts,                     bad words, and bad actions. They reach such a degree as to even justify their sins                     by calling themselves the best Christians.                          But  I  think  otherwise.  I  do  not  like  such  people  to  share  in  my  institutes,                     because such a sharing is to the prejudice of both of us.  One Jonah was more                     than enough in a ship to make a storm rise, threatening the ship with sinking.                     Only when Jonah was thrown overboard did the storm die down.  If I permit the             426                     sharing  in    my    institute    by  the  people  who  have  no    fear    of    God,    who                     disregard the religious duties, who are defiled by transgressions of  divine  law I                     have good reason to fear that  God  and  divine providence will cut the help,                     letting  the  storm  sink  us.  But  I  am  determined  to  expel  the  Jonahs  for  our                     common interest.  To save the others, I have to cut the corrupted member who                     attracts divine punishments. If I do not behave this way, I will render an account                     to the Lord, who will punish me.                          My dearest brothers and sisters:                          Even  though I am an unworthy minister of the Lord,  I  feel confident that                     you will receive my words as a beneficial  warning from  our Lord Jesus Christ,                     who wants to drive you on a  better way of living. Your being observant of the                     Christian law attracts the divine blessings on you during this life, making  you                     worthy of eternal salvation (Vol. 3, page l33).                           Then, he adds some rules about how to attend the mass, the sacraments, and                     religious instructions.","5. For the conversion of sinners                              Because  the  conversion  of  souls  is  a  work  of  God,  the  Father  wanted  his                     institution  of  Avignone  to  be  a  center  of  prayer  to  implore  the  conversion  of                     sinners from divine  mercy.  He set  up the \"Fraternity  of Immaculate Heart  of                     Mary  for  the  Conversion  of  Sinners\"  with  practices  of  piety  and  prayers.                     Additional prayers were said to the most holy Heart of Jesus (Vol.  4, page 9).                     The Father inscribed the institute's members to the \"Pious Union of Prayers and                     Penance\"  which  aims  at  the  conversion  of  sinners,  the  destruction  of  the  bad                     press, and the exaltation of the Holy See. The Father also added the prayer for                     the good workers and the conversion of France (Vol. 6, page 39).                           In the early times three prayers were said to the most  holy Heart  of  Jesus                     for the following intentions very dear  to  the Father:  for the souls who slackened                     in the divine  service;  for those who once were loving the sacred Heart,  but                     cooled down and were running the risk of getting lost;  and for those who did not                     answer the call of the sacred Heart.                           We  find  a  singular  prayer  in  the  Father’s  writings.    \"For  that  child  who  is   427                     running  the  risk  of  receiving  a  bad  education,  but  would  become  holier  than                     others (at the same conditions), if he/she receives Christian education\" (S.C. Vol.                     l0, page 22).                           When the Father  was called to assist a  dying rebel,  or he had  to deal with                     desperate cases, he prayed and made people pray more.                           So  many  times  people  heard  him  saying  that  he  was  willing  to  die  for  the                     salvation of one soul.                           He  often  celebrated  for  the  conversion  of  sinners,  and  when  he  heard  of  a                     dying impenitent, he gathered the community in the church for special prayers,                     exhorting to do penance, fasting, and vigils, as he himself did.                           When other priests did not succeed to approach persons who were publicly                     against religion, they resorted to the Father. Before offering his priestly ministry,                     he used to gather his community in prayer.                           Writes Father Vitale,","\"By  my  own  experience,  the  grace  of  God  almost  always  triumphed.  I                     myself willingly resorted to him several times even in the night, and he ran to                     assist  the  dying.  Sometimes  he  found  such  great  resistance  as  to  draw  back.                     Once, a dying person gave him a long sullen look, then he spit in his face. As                     always, the Father kept calm considering himself a tool in the Lord's hands.\"                           The following episode ended differently.                           A worker of ours relates the conversion of Magazzu', a big blasphemer who                     did not even want to  hear of the  Father.  The Camellian  Father  Ernest had                     already baptized his children  upon agreement with their mother.                           Meanwhile  the  Father  prayed,    trying  to  approach  him,  but  in  vain.  One                     evening, a worker of ours happened to meet the man near Magazzu's house. He                     was so discouraged. The worker asked him what the matter was.  After entering                     the  house,  Magazzu’  burst  into  tears  and  remembered  how  much  evil  he  had                     done against God, the saints, and also against our Servant of God.                           Our  worker heartened and took him to the Father.   Says the witness, “The                     encounter reminded me of the father hugging the prodigal son.\"                           The following day Magazzu' received Holy Communion from the Father, who              428                     helped him generously until his death.                        6. Apostolate of the family                              By entering Avignone Quarter, the Father received from the Lord the mission                     to put order in that swarm of human beings who had gone as low as to reach                     brutalization.  They did not know bonds of family, nor did they respect rights or                     duties of blood. All marriages were illegitimate Educating those blinded minds                     by making them understand the dignity of marriage was a hard work. But,  by                     invoking the Lord with prayer and sacrifice,  the Father succeeded  to  remedy                     that","disorder  step  by  step.  Obviously, everything happened at his own expenses,                     beginning with decent clothes, up to the rent of the houses, where those people                     could have a nest.                           The last apostolate the Father did among the dwellers of Avignone was the                     marriage  of  Lucy,  a  few  decades  later.    She  was  the  former  orphan  girl  who                     adhered to the Father’s cassock, crying, \"Do not go to Naples, and do not go\"                           Poor child,  she perhaps had a presentment that the Father's leave  would be                     the  beginning  of  her  ruin  As  a  matter    of    fact,  whether    unconsciously    or                     perversely,    her  mother  took  her    away  from  the  institute  during  the  Father's                     absence, and abandoned her to  a  bad destiny The poor Lucy cohabited with a                     man 40  years, becoming  a  mother of l0 children Finally,  the prayer  of  the                     Father  and  of  so many good souls,  to whom  he  had  appealed, triumphed,                     and  the  Father himself blessed the wedding  of  his former orphan.                           Many  consecrated  souls  answered  the  Father’s  call.    We  remember  the                     Daughters of Blessed Sister Mary of Jesus and the Sisters of Morning Star, in                     Naples.  Reading the funeral oration of the venerable Sister Mary Lucy of the                     Sacred Heart, in Naples, in November l907, the Father reveals, “One day I was                     called  in  Messina  to  religiously  validate  the  marriage  of  a  man  who  was       429                     cohabiting for so many years with a woman.  He was suffering a heart disease,                     and I unusually felt that I should validate it quickly.  I confessed the spouses,                     blessed  their  marriage,  and  gave  them  the  Holy  Communion.    The  following                     night the husband breathed his last.  His salvation was a wonder.  I  was  still                     amazed,  when  Sister Mary Lucy wrote to me informing that  while she            was                     before the Blessed Sacrament exposed,  she felt that her beloved asked her,  'Tell                     me what you want.'  She answered, ‘My Jesus, save the souls, especially those of                     Messina'\" (Vol. 45, page l39).                           The Father was particularly zealous for this kind of priestly ministry, and he                     recommended it to his Religious.  \"The Rogationists will take care of validating                     illegal marriage unions with the sacrament of marriage\" (Vol.  3, page 29).  A                     sister  reports:    \"Following  the  Father's  suggestion,  we  prudently  asked  the                     workers  and  the  beggars  about  their  relation  with  God.  According  to  their                     situations, we prepared them for the first Communion,  or a better attendance of                     the sacraments,  or for the sacrament of marriage.\"                           The  Father was concerned not only with workers and beggars. For instance,                     Lawyer Guardavaglia of Taormina was not married in the church.  After praying                     so much, the Father succeeded in","validating his marriage, and the lawyer turned to be so devoted to him that he                     resumed the practices of Christian life, and became an assiduous, strong defender                     of the Father's institute.                           This  institute  was  operating in the first  floor  of  the Capuchins'  former                     convent,  whose  main  floor was  used  as  a district prison.  The jailer was Don                     Pancras Incorvaia.  But  his title  Don  had  nothing to do with  religious  dignity;                     on    the  contrary,      he    was    a    quarrelsome,      concubinary    man,      and    a                     blasphemer. The mother superior of that house remembers, \"I asked the Father                     how we should deal with this man who lived on the next floor and made endless                     noise with his behavior. He answered, ‘My daughter, it is since twenty years that                     I am praying with the host in my hands for his conversion, you instead would                     like  to  reach  his  conversion  all  of  a  sudden.    Let  us  pray  and  treat  him  with                     meekness.      The  people  marveled  and  smiled  when  the  Father  sometimes                     embraced  and  kissed  Don  Pancras,  giving  him  some  gifts;  and  Don  Pancras                     reacted rudely sometimes.  When his woman was about to give birth, I informed                     the Father that I would like to be her godparent.  Before giving birth, however,                     the  Servant  of  God  succeeded  to  validate  their  marriage  with      confession,                     Communion,  and  wedding.    Don  Pancras  changed  completely.  He  left  out                     blasphemies  and bad examples,  and attended the church  and sacraments  until            430                     his  holy death,  to great  amazement  of  the people.\"  The  Father  received  their                     daughter  gratis  in  the institute,  and when Incorvaia retired, the Servant of God                     bought the  field Incorvaia was working as a share cropper,  letting him continue                     his  work  and  giving  him  all  the  produce.  The  Father  took  care  of  Incorvaia's                     spiritual life by also providing him with sacred books, which he devoured with                     great profit.                           Dr. Salvatore Cacciola's case seems a marvel. The Father was very thankful to                     him.   As a mayor, he had helped the Father to found the orphanage at Taormina.                     But  he  was  an  atheist,  and  after  his  wife's  death  he  cohabited  with  his                     housekeeper.   The Father prayed continuously for him, paid visits now and then,                     and waited for the time of mercy.  Once, he made a performance in the institute                     in his honor, sent to him a copy of his Letter to the Friends, which he read and                     commented with his wife.  Finally, Cacciola promised to go to confession and to                     validate his union. But, one day people informed the Father that the man was on                     the verge of dying.  He hastened from Messina to pay a visit to him; the man was                     in a coma with a concussion of the brain.","I happen to know some details from the Father, but, before relating them,                     I  premise  that  he  knew  the  Abbot  Kneip’s  healing  system  by  personal                     experience.                           As soon as the Father entered the dying man's room, he made everyone leave.                     He ordered a pail of cool water, a pail of warm water, and two towels.  He began                     applying  warm  poultices  on  the  dying  man's  feet,  and  cool  ones  on  his  head.                     Cacciola  opened  his  eyes,  and  recognized  the  Father.  Our  Founder  heard  the                     confession  of  Cacciola,  validated  the  marriage,  and  gave  the  extreme  unction.                     Reconciled  with  God,  Cacciola  breathed  his  last.    The  Servant  of  God  was                     extremely  joyous,  and  recalled  the  event  with  tears.    Someone  who  knew  of                     Cacciola's coma, spoke of a dead resurrected.  But the Father praised Kneipp's                     system which helps human beings so much with its hydrotherapy.                         7. Return to the sheepfold                              We are about to write of some conversions of protestants who returned to the         431                     church through the Father's ministry.                           One day the Father went to Taormina to baptize a protestant girl; another time                     he attended a retraction in Oria; several times he witnessed many retractions in                     Messina.  We report the main ones.                           On  May  29,  l886,  The Light  relates the baptism and  the validation of the                     marriage of Lady Catherine Oliva,  maiden  name Lendy,  from  Switzerland.                     She was the wife of Prof.  Gaetano Oliva,  continuer of Gallo's Chronicles of                     Messina.  The rite was performed in the Avignone chapel in the presence of the                     orphans, who were  \"joyous and edified by the unexpected rite.\" The Father had                     prepared  this  conversion  with his  personal  prayers  and sacrifices,  and also by                     directing the sacrifice of a young  girl to this end.                           Mr.  and Mrs.  Oliva had a daughter named Olga,  a flower of courtesy  and                     kindness.  She was educated in the Catholic  faith,","and  was  directed by the Father,  as confessor.  At the  age  of eighteen, she was                     struck by a sudden disease. The Father assisted and   heartened her to suffer her                     pains  with  perfect    resignation  to  God's  will,    offering  them  for  her  mother's                     conversion.  In  the  last    moments  of  her  life,    while  hugging  her  mother,    the                     young girl  exhorted her to embrace the Catholic faith in order  to  be eternally                     united in heaven.  The mother promised to do so.  Olga died on April 2l, l885,                     and her mother made her retraction in the following May.                           Ernest  Crisafulli was a youth of a good family,  but he was trapped  by the                     protestants.  The Father looked after him a  long time, until grace triumphed over                     him. He retracted his errors and entrusted the Father to publish his retraction in                     the  press.  On January  l8,  l890,  the  Father  gave The  Light     the  following                     wording,  \"The  undersigned Ernest Crisafulli by the Lord's grace recognizes  the                     protestant errors in which he  had  fallen,  and declares that he has embraced                     again the Catholic faith,  in which he  was born.  He hopes to persevere in it until                     death  with  the Lord's grace. Messina, January ll, l890. Ernest Crisafulli.\"                           Let  us see a non-conversion.  Mrs.  Hill,  a  rich  English protestant,  was                     resident in Taormina for  many years for health reasons.  The  Father  prayed for                     her  until  her    death.    She    was  unshakable  in  her  staunch  ideas,  but  very                     compassionate for human miseries.  He  endeavored to make the Salesians come              432                     to Taormina, organized  an embroidery school for the poor girls of  the  town,                     and was very generous in giving alms. The bishop of Gozzo (Malta) knew her                     very well and told the high priest of Taormina, \"Let her in peace, she is in good                     faith.\"                           Being  affectionate to the Father and his  institution,  she supported  them by                     even sending her nurse in case of  need.  When the   fire   destroyed  the  sisters'                     wardrobe,   she   remedied everything.                           She  survived the Father and attended his funeral.  She  was the  only one who                     had the privilege to place on his coffin a palm with a bunch of violets she had                     brought from Taormina.  Her  card read, \"To the dear Saint Canon Di Francia.\"                           But  she  remained  firm in her religious  ideas  until  her death.  What about                     her? The Father said to the mother superior of Taormina,  \"Owing to her works                     of charity, she will save her soul better than me, you, and others...\"                           At the end of the Father's life, Knight Zuccaro was mayor at Taormina. His                     widowed mother was causing scandal and he","himself  was    living  with  a  protestant  woman  without  being  married  in    the                     church.    The  Father  exhorted  the  mayor's  mother  to  Christian  life  by  paying                     frequent visits to her.   The conversion of the mayor's wife happened this way.  In                     l923, the Father preached the l3 days in  honor  of  Saint  Anthony.  The  mayor's                     wife    attended    his  preaching  and  was  so  impressed  by  the  Servant  of  God's                     behavior. When he asked her whether she was a Catholic, she answered in the                     negative, but that she would be happy if the Servant of God would succeed  to                     convince  her  of  her  errors...    His    teaching    lasted  about  a  month,    and  her                     retraction,    confession,    Communion,    and  confirmation  crowned  the  Father's                     apostolate.                           The  protestant declared that after the Servant of the  Lord asked  her  whether                     she was a Catholic,  her conscience  remained anxious until her conversion.  As                     to Mrs.  Zuccaro, who fell into the errors of theosophy,  the Father wrote a long                     letter  calling her back to the sound doctrine of obedience to the Church (Ch. 3,                     no. l2).                           Often,  the  Father combined the validation of the  people's marriage  with the                     baptism of their children.  If they were poor, he  helped them financially.  \"He                     was concerned  with  validating marriages  and  baptizing children,  also giving                     them  financial help.\"  A  sister  speaks  of baptism of  youths  \"from  aberrant         433                     families.  The Father taught them religion... It made a favorable impression on                     the relatives Cardile and Vinci. Two of the Cardile families  were  baptized;  one                     was  thirteen  years    old,    the    other  eighteen.  Their  sister,  who  was  already  a                     teacher, received first Communion. The boy of the Vinci family was baptized at                     the age of ten; the girl received first Communion at fourteen.\"\"                           The case of Congressman Fulci,  a teacher at the  university and a great figure                     of Messina freemasonry,  is worth remembering. Today  freemasonry  likes  to                     present itself as cooled  down  and sweetened,  but  in those times it declared                     open  war  against    the  clergy,  the  Church,  and  religion.  Also  by  Don  Orione's                     help,  then  vicar    general    of  Messina,    the  Father  succeeded  to    have    Fulci                     married in the church.  But for the baptism of his  child,  Fulci had  planned  the                     rite  with  champagne  on  a  ship.  Both  the archbishop and good people looked                     quite dismayed at the news. The Father  went to Fulci asking humbly and simply                     to  be  the  minister  of  the  religious  baptism.  Fulci  was  disconcerted,  but                     immediately complied with the Father's wish,  and the sacrament was performed                     in  the near parish.  The attempted scandal was eliminated. Fulci remained  much                     attached  to  our  founder,    openly  calling    him    \"My  godparent\"    in    any                     circumstance.  He seems to have said  to  the Servant of God, \"Only you can stay                     in my house, no other priest\" The  Father  held  Fulci with  gifts,  visits,  etc.,  but                     Fulci remained  stubborn.  A  sign  of repentance  was  noticed  later.","Someone  even  said  that he had made a hint  of  greeting  while passing   in                     front  of  Saint  Clement's  church.   After   the validation of his marriage,  he let                     his wife light a lamp  before the picture of the sacred Heart in his bedroom.  The                     grace of the Lord  is always effective.  Father Vitale says that the professor asked                     the Father to assist him in case of  death.  Our  founder, however, died before and                     Fulci openly cried saying, \"We have lost the   padre\"   He  attended  the  funeral                     carrying  a   cordon.           In  his last sickness,  Fulci welcomed Father  Vitale,                     who  was eager to hear his confession.  Fulci,  however,  worsened quickly and                     people had no time to call the priest.  We like thinking that the Father's prayer                     granted him mercy.  As a matter of fact,  the evening before his death,  while                     leaving,  Father Vitale exhorted him  to  recommend himself to God,  and Fulci                     added \"and  to  the Madonna.\" Didn't she intervene to save him?                           The son of Fulci was prepared for the first Communion by the Father,  who                     stayed  near  him  to  suggest  how  to  receive  and  thank  the  Lord.  Father  Vitale                     performed the liturgy.                         8. Thomas Cannizzaro                                                                      434                              As  soon  as  the Father heard of a  person,  especially  of prominence,  being                     far  from  the Church,  he did  his  best  to approach him.  At great grief of his                     heart, freemasonry prevailed in Messina in those days.   But quite a few masons                     surrendered to the careful attention of the Father,  and received the sacraments                     much to the satisfaction of the Father.                           Usually,  he  found  a  way  to  introduce  himself  to  them  through  the    sisters.                     They  went  to the sick with  a  gift,   gave  the Father's greeting, and opened the                     way for a personal contact.                           Among  the famous men far from faith whom the Father  guided to God at the                     point of death, Chemist Cananzi and criminal lawyer  Francis Faranda who was                     also a politician, are well remembered.","The  Father  had  strict and longer  relations  with  Thomas Cannizzaro                     (l838-l92l). He was an outstanding  poet, a patriot, a polyglot,  and an author of                     many verses in Italian, Sicilian, and French,   as  well  as  a  translator  from                     ancient  and  modern languages.(2) The light of faith, however, shone in his eyes                     only  in  the  last  moments  of  his  life.  Under  the  pretext  of  poetry,  the  Father                     cultivated friendly relations with him,  usually  going to his  house  with  Father                     Vitale.  This  relates,  \"The  religious conversations were on literary topics; they                     read each other their poems.\"  A year after Cannizzaro's death,  Messina held a                     solemn commemoration of its poet and patriot man,  and the Father deemed to                     intervene    with  an  article  on  the      Scintilla  (September    6,  l922),  giving  the                     citizens a more exact knowledge of the man, due to his personal relations with                     the poet.                            Thomas    Cannizzaro,    a  versatile  writer  in  prose  and  verses,  was  an  outstanding                     figure of our city for his extensive learning. An expert of several languages, he wrote                     French verses as easily, tastefully,  and elegantly as in the native language.  He was  in                     correspondence  with  several  writers,    Victor  Hugo  included,    whom  he    visited  in                     France  and  had  the  honor  to  be  a  guest  of  his    for  three    days.    Well    known    and                     admired in Italy for  his  various works,  several  newspapers  sang his praise at the                     news  of  his death. A few days ago, Messina commemorated the first anniversary of        435                     his  death,  and our very friend Dr.  Leopold Nicotra  had  a moving speech.                          Now  let us get some things straight.  Cannizzaro was not  a Catholic writer.  But,                     even  though  he  had  queer  aberrations  about  principles,  in  practical  life  he  was  very                     kind, natural, upright, and unable to offend anyone. His daughters educated in Catholic                     faith are  an  evidence  of  their  Father's  respect  for  freedom  of conscience.                          He  had  great-uncles  canons that left to  him  a  piece  of property  with a little                     church for the celebration of the mass on holidays.  To  tell  the truth in honor of his                     lamented    memory,  Cannizzaro   never    left    out    this    duty    until    the     earthquake                     destroyed the church; and if people had rebuilt it, he would have had the mass said.                          Owing  to  the good dispositions of his spirit,  God's  eyes bent mercifully to him.                          It  is quite a few years since a priest of ours visited  him as  an  admirer of his genius,                     qualities,  and verses.  A  close friendship  was born between them,  and Cannizzaro                     was  amused    at  listening  to  that  priest's    verses  on  sacred  topics.  Loving  hints  of                     personal,   eternal  salvation through faith in Jesus'  divinity and the Catholic religion                     were submitted to Cannizzaro,  in order to look after his own salvation.  He once read  a                     poem of his own to the most holy Virgin.  He had written it by commission, but he                     infused in it loving sentiments for the Mother of God.                                  Here there are some verses of the Father which answer  those","by  Cannizzaro.  They  follow  the same  meter  and  rhyme.  With admirable                     modesty, Cannizzaro had written to the Father:                                Human knowledge is like dust of the earth,                               Which the wind lifts up and takes away in a moment,                               Like a glow that dies out at its birth.                                If my conscience can say something,                               It will only express this lament:                               I only know that I know nothing.                           The Father answered:                                I desire that like blustering wind of the earth                               The eternal breath hit you, and in a moment                               Guide you to the faith's light's rebirth!                                Oh, I only like to say the following:                               I love you, and my heart is content                               If you know Jesus. The remnant is nothing!                           Another sonnet ends thus:                                                            436                                Before Jesus, sublime Highnesses bent                               As to God who breaks any pride:                               Who forgives the faults to any penitent.                                My lord, join me in your humble loss,                               And your eyes that shed tears may abide                               In the splendor of his cross                           Cannizzaro  writes  three  octaves  talking  nonsense  about faith,  but the                     Father corrects and states more exactly. We quote one of the Father's octaves.                                Divine faith is blind and yet clairvoyant,                               Is dark, but shining to the reason;                               Human faith instead does daunt,                               Fooling itself in a vain illusion.                               Who lacks divine faith, does flaunt                               Believing in the error imposed on.                               But when the black veil of the error is fought,                               The holy faith becomes the star of the thought.                           The Father ended a sonnet by exhorting Cannizzaro to believe in the divinity                     of Jesus:","Oh, my lord, I wonder why the thought                               That Jesus Christ is God                               Does not enkindle your heart, making it overwrought                           The  poet  answers that he appreciates that  Jesus  is  \"the sublime  son of                     Mary.\"  The  Father  takes  that  occasion  to  write    a  beautiful  letter  about  the                     divinity of Jesus Christ.                           I thank you for your wonderful, easy sonnets. But I love you and desire that                     you  love  Jesus  Christ  not  only  as  the  sublime  son  of    Mary,    but  also  as  the                     eternal Son of God and as true God To believe in him as a man,  to admire him as                     a sublime man,  is the same  as to disbelieve him In fact,  if I said,  \"I  esteem                     Mr. Cannizzaro  as  an  honest citizen,  but I think that  he  is  an idiot,\" I would                     be mistaken, falling into lack of respect So, we cannot deprive Jesus Christ of his                     divinity without wronging him I  ask you:  \"How do you know that Jesus Christ                     is a sublime man; who  expelled  the Pharisees from the temple;  who  consoled                     the afflicted,  etc.?\"  We know from  the  gospel.  Well,  then,  the gospels are                     full  of  accounts  of  the  divinity  of  Jesus  Christ.  And  he  expatiates  on                     demonstrating  the  humanity  and  divinity  of  Jesus  through  the  episodes  of  the                     gospel (Vol. 5, page ll8).                                                                                                               437                          We continue the Father's report.                           His    priest    friend  sometimes  reminded  him  of  Victor    Hugo's  words    that                     \"among the miseries of this world there is  a  great hope  of  an  everlasting                     happiness smiling  at  us  and  shining through the darkness of this life\"                          That    priest  was  not  in  Messina  when  Cannizzaro  fell  in    his  last  illness.                     However, a ray of the divine light illuminated his mind.  He said, \"I want to die                     comforted by the sacraments of the holy  Church:  I  myself take the initiative.'                     Even  though      his  kind    daughter  was  on  his  side,    he  himself  sent  for  a                     Dominican  priest    friend    who    was  living    at    Giostra.    After    confessing,                     receiving  holy Viaticum,  and Extreme Unction he  retracted  his errors  against                     the Catholic religion and signed his  retraction willingly.                          Thus, we think that God's great mercy received that prodigal soul in eternal                     forgiveness.                          Obviously,  the  Italian  newspapers contrary  or  at  least indifferent  to  our                     holy  religion  praised  Cannizzaro,    but    they  will  not  report  this  article.    We                     instead  publish  it  to  help    the  Catholics,  or  at  least  those  of  good  disposition,                     understand that living  according  to  the  Catholic  faith  is  the  science  of                     sciences.  As a matter of fact, in point of death no one repented for  being  a                     Catholic;   on the contrary,  many a  person  felt themselves  in  need  to embrace                     it.  This is  one  of  the  best evidences of our Catholic religion's divinity (S.C.                     Vol. l, page 97).(3)","9. A letter to the friends                              To call the attention of unchurched magistrates, professors, and  intellectuals                     to the supreme interest  of the salvation  of their  soul,  the Father published  a                     theological-moral-pastoral booklet  in  his last years.  The title given to this work                     seems academic, but it is a living manifestation of the Father's heart: \"Canon  H.                     M.  Di Francia's letter  to the friends and lords  he loves  like himself and whose                     well being and happiness  he  longs for as he would for himself.\"                           In a simple,  plain  style he treats  the topics of  God, Jesus Christ,  and the                     Church;   as well as our duties toward God,  the importance of eternal salvation,                     and the means to achieve it. The means are prayer, good reading, and devotion to                     Our Lady. He lays the  blame  on  \"the great reserve,\" that is to  say,  the  human                     respect.  Speaking of humility, which opens the door of grace, he recalls  our                     great  men  who  prevailed  over  human    respect:    Dante,  Giottto,  Colombo,                     Michelangelo,  Volta,  Pellico,  Manzoni,  Augustus  Conti,    and  his  own  teacher                     Bisazza. He quotes choice evidence  of them,  and  concludes with the whole,                     famous  speech  of    John  Prati  to  the  senate.    We  only  relate  the  following                     statement: \"I am a believer,  and I am proud to declare so from this seat.  The old       438                     shepherds  of  my  Alps  will  say,    \"He  is  the  same  we  have  known  from    his                     childhood;  he confessed God in our cottages,  now  he confesses  him in the                     senate of Italy!' I will not get upset  for quite  a few free-thinkers,  stormy and                     incautious  spirits  that would  like veiling the figure of the Most High because of                     their immoderate idolatry to science and freedom\"                           Explains the Father,                           \"I  have  designed  this  letter  for  those  who,    according  to  my  personal                     knowledge,  reference,  or fame, have admirable gifts of mind  and heart and                     seem like they would be favorably disposed to receive   my  pure  expressions  of                     friendship  with  the   pure impartiality  of reason.\" The reason urging the Father                     to    write  such  a  letter  is  the following:    \"Since  I  have  devoted  my  life  to  the                     sacred","ministry,  as a priest of Jesus Christ I feel a loving affection  and a longing for                     the welfare and happiness of  others  just as I do for myself. I think of myself as                     being joined by the link of friendship with all people on earth, rich or poor, lords                     or workers,  humble or aristocratic. I have seen  a brother and  a lord in everyone                     and what I have longed for me in this and in the after life,  I have longed for                     others  in  the  same  way.\"  He  wrote    so  in  a  printed  page  accompanying  the                     booklet (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 336).                           We like quoting the conclusion. After explaining how easy it is  to  observe                     God's law and how bitter is the road  leading  to perdition,  he states,  \"We have                     more difficulty, suffering  more when  we run the road leading to perdition than                     when we  run  the road leading to salvation.\"  The Father asks himself,  \"What                     else can I add?\"                          He  answers,                           I  have  exhausted  my  loving,    insinuating  persuasions  to  lead  you  into  the                     saving hands of God,  your creator and redeemer;  to call  your  attention  on the                     great importance   of  being  saved eternally  with  your relatives;  and to submit                     to you  the  easy means  to  achieve the final aim of life  I have  another  thing                     left  to  do,  and  I  will  heartily:  I  will  pray  daily,  my dearest...., especially in                     the celebration of the holy mass, when I hold Jesus in my hands.                          I  have  prayed and I will until the last breath of my  life for  your eternal       439                     salvation.    When  breathlessness  announcing  death  tires    me,    I  will  make  my                     panting a supplication to the Lord  so that his grace enlighten,  touch,  and win                     you.  May these  words cross  your  mind,  awaken  the  most  living  interest  in                     your salvation  along  with  that  of yours,  and make  you  take  the necessary,                     easy means I have suggested,  despite the false world deceiver.                          This,  however, is not enough. As I firmly hope, when I will be  in  heaven in                     the bosom of my creator and  redeemer,  I  will continue praying face to face to                     my adorable Lord,  the most holy Virgin Mary,  the saint  of your name, and your                     guardian angel. I will do so for your eternal salvation and that of yours,  seeking                     your  cooperation.  May  you  be  my  companion  in  the  eternal happiness                           This  protestation  and hope closes the letter  that  Father Vitale  defines the                     Father's \"last will,  his soul's last cry  in the midst of the society in which he                     lived.    It  was  as  though    he  said,    'I    am  thirsty'\"  (Father  Mary  Hannibal  Di                     Francia,  page 336).                          The Father wanted this letter printed in a big format.  Says the printer, \"When                     I raised objections of typographic aesthetics, he reacted,  'No,  no; most of them                     are old men of poor sight; to read,   they   need  block  letters'.\"  The  booklet                     was  mailed personally","to the people he called  friends,  but  unfortunately known  for  their incredulity.                     To  know  their  names  and  to    reach  them,    Lady    Schiro'  remembers  that  our                     founder appealed  to  her Father Hercules Bonetti.  The address the Servant of                     God wrote on the  envelope  by  his  own handwriting  impressed  some  of  the                     receivers.  When the Father happened to come across some of them, he asked                     first  whether  they  had  received  his  letter  and  what  were  the    results  of  their                     reading.  In his simplicity  and  zeal,  he almost  expected  their conversion and                     the practice of  Christian life.                         10. With the priests lapsed                             When  God's  honor was at stake,  the Father cried and  even proposed the                     removal of the priest oblivious of his duty.                           Writes Father Vitale,                           \"More  than once in his life,  he had to suffer with  bitter tears for the fate of   440                     some flock entrusted to unworthy shepherds. Dressed like lambs, these leaders                     cheated their superiors.                           He never stopped working at any cost,  risking even  his own life,  to help the                     authority save the sheep in jeopardy. His work was relentless until he reached his                     goal.                           How  many  blessings later came to the padre  (Father  Mary Hannibal Di                     Francia, page 334).                           He was full of charity and zeal toward the priests lapsed or apostates.  Every                     time the bishops asked him to meet them   (and some   of  the cases were very                     delicate),    he  showed    himself    as  loving  Father,    full  of  charity  and  caution.                     Many  of  the  priests  were    driven  back  to  Christ  and  the  Church;    several                     suspended  a divinis  were sheltered by the Servant of God upon agreement with                     the bishop until their redemption.  Someone cites the  names.  \"I remember  the                     good  he  did to the  apostate  priest  Natoli  by sheltering him at Avignone.                     When  the  chancery  office  was  about  to  qualify  him  again,    he  died  by                     tuberculosis.  Upon agreement with the  archbishop,  he  also sheltered Father                     Meli because  of  his","drunkenness.  As to Mr.  Chinigo',  a former priest of O. M., who was  laicized                     after  l860,  cohabited  with  a  woman,  and  had children;  he  was given a                     careful, gentle, and cautious attention by  the  Father,  who  made  him repent.                     He    died    in    the    l908  earthquake.    Father    Carbone  was  at  war  with  the                     archbishop.  The Servant  of God drove him on the right road.  He preached in                     our house  the  retreat  to the Priest Carbone who  was  suspended   a divinis,                     discussed  the  situation  with  the  bishop,    and    obtained  the  restoration  to  the                     priestly ministry.\"                           To  earn  his  living,   Father  Carbone  set  up  a  little delicatessen shop.  He                     himself sliced bologna and ham against the order of the chancery office,  causing                     a scandal to the faithful. The Father made him consider the grave inconvenience                     and exhorted him to work in his church. Giving him a statue of Saint Rita, the                     Father    foretold  him  that  bread  and  work  would  never    fail.    This  was    the                     beginning  of  the devotion  to  Saint  Rita  in  Saint Paulinus' church.                           Father  Carbone  sang  the  praise  of  the  Father    untiringly.    A  Rogationist                     narrates:    \"Pointing  to  the  Servant  of  God's  tomb  in  the  sanctuary,    Father                     Carbone exclaimed, 'How much indebted I am with that great soul I am sure to                     get my salvation,  because  he promised that he would pray for me in paradise'\"                          Canon  Ferretti,  the  high priest at the cathedral of  Oria went  so far in the     441                     war against the bishop that the  Holy  Office intervened  and suspended him a                     divinis.  The Father induced  the priest  to  acknowledge  his wrong through a                     retraction  on  the press,  and  obtained his restoration.  The priest remembered                     the Father so thankfully all his life long.                           Canon  Barsanofio  writes,   \"The  Servant  of  God  was  so sensitive  to the                     needs of the clergy that many priests  appealed to him,  finding shelter and help                     in his house of Oria.  Even  in the  presence of grave difficulty or failures,  he                     never   denied his  work,  above  all when the matter was the restoration  of  a                     lapsed one.\"                          The  prayers for the poor apostates were continuous.  In the Father's  notes  we                     read that he entrusted 5  apostates  to  the sacred wounds of our Lord.  One of                     them,  the former chaplain  of the house in Giardini, was entrusted to the wound                     of the Heart of Jesus (S.C. Vol. l0, page 84).                          Four  of them died repented and reconciled with the  Church. The  former                     Capuchin    of  Francavilla    Fontana    fell    lower,    was  declared  escomunicated                     vitando, and died as such. Let us trust in the Lord's mercy                          The    Father  said  special  prayers  and  gave  careful    attention  to    Father                     Perciabosco.  Due to political reasons at the time  of the  revolution,  he  had                     come into contrast  with  the  bishop, abandoned","priesthood,  and  retired  to  his    property  in  the  country  of    Pezzolo  (Messina),                     living  honestly.    The  Father  wrote    (S.C.  Vol.    5,    page  298),    visited,  and                     exhorted him, but he pretended not  to  know.  On one occasion,  the Father sent                     to  him  Father Franze'  of  the  Friars  Minor,  inviting him to  come  down  to                     Messina.   The Father told Father Franze', \"He is a priest who has suffered too                     much;  now he lives in the mountains without  saying mass since many years.  If                     you  succeed  to  have  him  down,  it  would  be    a    holy    work  for  his  bad                     conditions.\"    Perciabosco    welcomed  Father  Franze',  urged  him  to  share  his                     lunch, and spoke very well of the Father. Poor old man! He was really in bad                     conditions, and even though he was a learned man,  he was becoming brutal by                     dint of  living alone,  far from society.  Writes Father  Franze',  \"I talked  to  him                     as a brother trying to induce him to  leave  from that  existence and to retire near                     Father  Di  Francia,    who    would  welcome    and    provide  him  with  a  decorous                     human life.\"  In  vain. When  Father Di Francia knew the results,  he blamed                     himself  for the failure of that mission, and said, \"We need to pray with much                     more    fervor;    but  I  have  so  little  of  it!\"  At  the  end,    however,  his  prayers                     triumphed.  After  the  Father's  death,  Perciabosco  died  reconciled  with  God                     (Bulletin l947, no. 4, page 70).                                                                                                                 442                     11. Concerned with everything                              Any work about God's glory held the Father's interest.                           When the Jesuit Fathers succeeded to return to Messina after the  suppression                     by the Bourbons in the eighteenth  century,  the masonic lodges began creating                     several  troubles  for  them  in    order  to  make  them  retire.    The  good  people,                     however,  took sides with them.  In l89l,  the Father had the inaugural speech at                     the  feast  of  the  Jesuit  Father  Alphonsus  Labso,    the  chairman.  His  students                     prepared    the  feast  on  occasion  of  his  saint's  name.    The    Father  praised    the                     merits  of this \"religious family  that  like  very shining  star is guiding the youth                     to salvation since over  three centuries,\"  despite  the fights it faces continuously.                     Then  he exhorts, \"O youth, despise the world's","sneer, and openly say, 'We are disciple of a Jesuit'\" (Vol.  45,  page 435). Father                     Nalbone remembers,  \"When I was the rector in Messina, I invited him more than                     once to the college, and he always accepted edifying greatly the faithful.  He was                     very dear to the Jesuit order that gave him the figliuolanza, i.e., the sharing in its                     merits  and  suffrages.\"  We    remember    the    novena  and  the  panegyric  to  Our                     Lady  of  the Ladder,  the  panegyric to Saint Ignatius at the reviving of  his feast,                     interrupted  in l773,  and the panegyric to  Saint  Louis Gonzaga on the occasion                     of his centenary, in l89l.(4)                           As  we  have  said above,  the Father prayed  and  made  the faithful pray for                     the return of the Camellian Fathers to Messina.                           In    a    petition  to  the  Sacred  Heart    of    Jesus,    the    Father  recalled    how                     blooming their order was in Messina,  and implored, \"We  beg you for the sake                     of your infinite charity to  make  them return...  to send these ministries to our                     sick. May they be true children of Saint Camillus,  full of zeal, charity, humility,                     and  have    the    virtues    of  their  holy  founder  so  that    through    their  priestly                     ministry  souls  be  saved and  your  divine  heart  be consoled\" (Vol. 4, page 47).                     The eighteenth of each month special prayers were said for this intention.                           Another  fight  came  in  against the  Salesians  and  their institute  \"Saint       443                     Louis.\" The Father ordered his  communities  to pray  so  that  the enemies do not                     prevail  against  Don  Bosco's children. \"O Lord Jesus, till when will the enemies                     of your works glory  in  their  iniquity?\" He offers to the Sacred  Heart  \"the                     masses celebrated all over the world, and the Immaculate Heart of Mary  along                     with her virtues.\" Then he prays,  \"Make  this  right cause triumph, keep this holy                     school and  the institute where the youth learn to believe, know, fear, love, and                     serve you\" (Vol. 6, page 53).                           The    \"Lombardo\"  orphanage,    built  with  money  from    Lombardia  for    the                     orphans of the earthquake,   had no chapel.  The  Father endeavored  to transform                     one of its greatest halls into a chapel, furnished  it  with  altar,   pews,   sacred                     vestments,      almost  everything,    and    pledged    the    holiday  mass    and    the                     religious instruction of the youth.                           The  students at San Placid Calonero's  agricultural  school had  no  religious                     service because the nearby pretty  church  was closed.  The  Father had it opened                     for the school and pledged the holiday mass.  When he was free, he himself went                     over there; when busy, he provided the mass through others.                          Says    Father    Vitale,    \"The    Father    provided    most    of    the  \"Lombardo\"                     orphanage's furniture. When it opened, the Father sent me and other priests along                     with the clerics to say mass and","teach  religious    education;    we  did  the  same  at  San    Placid    Calonero's                     agricultural school.\"                           At  Larderia,  the people rose in rebellion because they did not want to accept                     the new chaplain appointed by the  archbishop. Furthermore,  they  threatened                     with killing the priest who  would dare to appear in their church.  They had no                     mass for quite a few Sundays.                           Upon  agreement  with the archbishop,  the Father went  over there.  He  had                     a  cold  reception;    but  it  changed    quickly    into  deference    and  devotion.    He                     performed the priestly ministry  for some time,  saying the mass in each of the                     two hamlets with  some sacrifice,  because he was over 70  years old, and the                     Eucharistic fasting was strict.  A sister remembers,  \"In that time,  I along with                     another  sister  accompanied  the  Father  to  teach  the  Christian  doctrine    to  the                     children of those \"savages,\" as he called  them, until  the  bishop provided with                     another priest.  But the  Father continued  being  concerned with the necessity of                     that  village, because  the knowledge of a spiritual need urged him  to  provide                     the faithful at any cost.\"                           Any  occasion was fitting to say a good word and to  hearten the people.  The                     Beacon, a weekly Catholic periodical of Messina, started  a  publication  in serial       444                     form about the activity  of  a priest who becomes an apostle of his town.  The                     Father seizes the opportunity  to give his support to the author.  \"I  happened  to                     read the article \"Examining...\" in the issue no. 9 of The Beacon. With  ostensible                     forms and opinions conform to truth,  you  prove the   great,   divine   power  of                     the  Catholic  priesthood   in regenerating souls, countries, and nations through                     the  gentleness  of    grace    and    the    evangelical    doctrine.    The    little    article                     describes  the young priest coming out  educated,  virtuous,  and learned  from                     the seminary and returning to his native  town.  He sees  his  town  deteriorated                     and  demoralized  by  previous  bad examples, but he does not dishearten, he                     rather trusts in God and plans  his behavior.  Thus,  he wins the faithful's  favor.                     This article moved me to tears,  because it shows what the evangelical workers                     can do in the name of God I found ground  to meditate on it  as   if it were a                     spiritual reading.  I would  like  that  the clerics read and meditate upon it.  Truly,                     the priest is the salt of  the  earth and the light of the world.  When he performs                     his duty in a holy manner,  he has an attractive,  divine  force upon the hearts.                           It is  of a great importance that we  priests strive to become worthy   of our                     divine ministry I warmly congratulate the  author","upon this writing,  whoever he is. I would like to hug him\" (S.C. Vol. l, page 80).                           The  Beacon's  issue of March  l4,  l902,  comments  on  the Father's letter:                     \"The great men's words are always a comfort, and Canon  Di  Francia's words to                     our  modest  work  fill  us    with    joy,  relieving    us    from  disenchantment  and                     bitterness.  We  heartily thank  him  for  his  courteous expressions and  for  his                     strong support, which we count on.\"                           The Father's sister wrote,  \"People in the village of  Gesso were  living  far                     from  the  sacraments  and  oblivious  of  the religious practices. The Father sent                     at his own expenses a Jesuit Father  for a fifteen day mission.  The faithful's faith                     awakened  again.    Conversions    and    validations    of    marriages    sealed    the                     mission.  An  altar to the Sacred Heart was inaugurated in  those days,  and  a                     fervent  homonymous  association    was    founded.    The  beautiful    statue  of  the                     Sacred Heart,  which is still venerated, was donated by the Father on the occasion                     of the mission.\"                           In    his  last  years,    the  Father  happened  to  know    that    some  persons    of                     Taormina  held  seances,    which  were  attended  even    by  girls  of  the  sisters'                     boarding  school.  Whatever  may  be  the  nature  of  particular  phenomena,  the                     spiritism's  doctrine  is  inconsistent  and  impious  (see  \"Spiritism,\"  Catholic       445                     Encyclopedia).  The Church orders the faithful to keep away from such practices.                           I remember how sad the Father became when a Salesian  Father laughed  at it                     in a meeting,  giving no importance to the matter. The Father lectured him,  \"Are                     you laughing?  You are supposed to cry\"                           The  Father  saw in it the devil's  work.  We  can  imagine, therefore,   how                     zealously  he  preached  against  this   grave superstition  which chilled the faith                     and  the  religious  practice.  As  usual,  before  beginning  the  new  apostolate,  he                     fostered prayer and printed some to the Sacred Heart, etc. He speaks of spiritism                     in  the Letter to the friends (page 55).  Thanks  to  God,  the Father  heard  the                     confession of several  spiritists,  and  they abandoned the seances.","12. For two religious communities                              Busy  as  he  was with his  communities,  the  Father  still consented to help                     other communities on any occasion.  We remember two institutes for which the                     Father was particularly zealous.                           The  first one regards the \"Geltrudine\" of the Sacred  Heart in Naples.  Started                     in l902 as a house of work for female workers, later  it  was transformed into an                     orphanage.  Then  a  religious institute came about.  The founder was the lay-                     sister  Benedictine  D.  Gertrude  Gomez  d'  Anza,  guided  by  Father  Angel                     Padovano.  Alike  other    works  of  God,    the  foundation  passed  through                     tribulations for  several years.  About l9l0 the Father happened to hear about it,                     and began helping it in various ways.  To help the aspirants in  the  beginning of                     the community of Saint  Gertrude,  for  the Father wrote the rules, he sent a few                     Daughters of Divine Zeal to Naples,  who  dressed as Benedictines.  To help the                     institution prosper financially, the Father published The Saint of Graces, in the                     pattern of our Miraculous Secret.  It aimed at  drawing  the faithful's  attention on                     the  nascent  institute,    which  is  happily  blooming  in  the  Church  (S.C.  Vol.  6,                     pages 230-269).                                                                                                               446                          To acknowledge the Father's merits, Father Padovano gave him the name co-                     founder in the special issue Heroine of Mansfel, which describes the institution's                     activities (Naples l9l4).                           Longer  and  harder  was  the  Father's  work  for  the  two institutes  of                     Father Eustachio Montemurro,  a man of  God  from Gravina  of Apulia.  The                     institutes are:  \"Little Brothers of the Blessed Sacrament,\" which had only quite a                     few  young    candidates,  but    no  Religious  yet;    and  \"Daughters  of  the  Sacred                     Side.\"  When Father Montemurro retired, a few bishops asked the Father to take                     over the direction,  and he did so in the hope to give it back to Montemurro   at                     his    return.      When    the    Father    realized    that  Montemurro's    return    was                     impossible,      he    aggregated    the    few  surviving  Little  Brothers  to  the                     Rogationists.","The  Daughter of the Sacred Side were directed by the Father  for  a few                     years.    Then  they  changed  their  name  into    \"Missionary  Sisters  of  the  Sacred                     Side,\" happily blooming. I concerned myself with a specific publication(5) about                     this institute's events that happened when the Father was  the director.  Now I                     point out  some episodes corresponding to the chapters of that work.                           The  mother  superior of the house in Potenza abandoned  her congregation,                     leaving after-effects among the girls who had made their  parents angry against                     the  institute.    A  revolution    arose:  assault  on  the  sisters'  house,  stones  at  the                     bishopric's  windows,  and    intervention  of  the  police.    Bishop  Monterise  was                     willing to fire the sisters,  but the Father intervened writing, \"The more a house                     is battled,  the more it sinks its roots to  give  copious fruits at the right time.                     Besides, surrendering to an enemy gives no glory to the Lord.  Why should you                     deprive Potenza of the good the  sisters  are doing?  At least they are coping with                     so  many little girls who are so worthy before God.  Why should we concede a                     victory to the hellish enemy?  Be sure,  the institution  will make  its way and                     give  more  benefits  to  the  people  at    the    right  time\"  (July  5,  l9l2).  He  also                     informed the mother superior of the congregation  that  he  had  written to  the                     bishop    \"trying    to  reconcile    him  in  favor  of  the  sisters.\"  Then  he  heartened                     them, \"In any case,  let us only trust in the Lord.  Let us endeavor to please the                     most  holy  Hearts  of  Jesus  and  Mary,  fearing  nothing  Because    the  pupils  of   447                     Potenza had decreased,  the Father pointed out,  \"It doesn't matter. One soul is                     worth as much as all souls. Let us take care of the little girls' instruction, and                     Jesus and Mary will bless us.\" Then he continued consoling them, \"Cheer Be in a                     cheerful mood, trust in the most holy Heart of Jesus; any nascent institute must                     go through  such  troubles.   We  need perseverance,  great  trust  in the Lord,                     and hope even  against hope\" (S.C. Vol. 8, pages l2l, l23).                           Writes  Msgr.    Farina,    \"I  noticed  the  Servant  of  God's    zeal  for  providing                     Spinazzola with a kindergarten and a laboratory for girls  through  the  Daughters                     of the  Sacred  Side.  They  were dwelling  in  a  rented  house which  was  the                     center  of  their activities.  When  the  owners  made  the decision  to  sell  it,                     claiming   a  sentimental  value,   cash   price,   the   nascent congregation  had no                     means  to  buy  it;    nor  the  bishop  of    Venosa.  The    good    bishop    feared    the                     suppression  of  that  beneficial institution  in  that town,  where the subversive                     propaganda    was  making  rapid  progress  everywhere  (it  was  in  l920).    The                     socialist party was prevailing,  taking over the civil  administration.  In spite  of                     his institute's financial worries,  Canon  Di  Francia pledged  to  raise  the funds                     necessary  to    buy    that    house.    He  succeeded,    and  the  sisters  still  have  it,                     operating a developed institution.\"","13. The beauty contest                              The  \"Vara\"  is a heavy,  several floor car full  of  little angels  ascending  and                     descending.  At its top is  Our   Lady.   It pulled  with  ropes  by the faithful                     enthusiastically    shouting,  \"Long  live  Mary,\"  in  the  traditional  procession  on                     August l5,  in Messina.                           In l923,  the committee organized the beauty contest for the first time.  The                     Father burned with holy indignation at the news, and   published a protest on the                     Scintilla,      signing      it,  \"Sacerdotium  lux  mundi.\"    He  points  out  the                     inconvenience of such a contest for the girls' education and formation.                           After touching upon the traditional custom of the \"Vara,\" he writes ironically,                           Today, however, we are in full evolution of civilization That procession with                     all its belongings is an old fashion feast of our granpas Today we need something                     else:  bare-naked women, white night-shirt dresses, like ballerinas.  We still need                     more. We  have to celebrate Our Lady by making the poor  girls  believe that                     being  born  pretty is a merit  worth  of  honors,  praise, admiration, and prizes;       448                     being born not pretty instead is worth of disapprobation  and ostracism It's just                     fate that monkeying is a special privilege in Italy That's done with the French                     press, the custom of beyond the Alps, the Americanism                           The beauty contest The poor girl who needs modesty as a [precious pearl of                     her  age  must  be  examined,  looked,  admired  and  re-admired  carefully  by  a                     triunvirate of arbiters...  They will examine how many centimeters long is her                     nose, whether her mouth is narrow or large, white or black her teeth, anemic or                     colored her cheeks.  About twenty, or thirty, or forty young girls will undergo                     this important examination. The five girls who appear the most beautiful to the                     arbiters’ superfine taste will be chosen; the others, discarded. The former go into                     rapture, thinking that being beautiful is good, virtuous, or wise.  The defeated                     think that they are worthy of reprobation and punishment So, the way of thinking                     is upset in that tender age The defeated think:  of what avail is it to be virtuous or                     wise Do they have undergone the examination of their virtue and wisdom?...","The winners will have pageboys Won't they? Doesn't she have the right to                     have servitude, the one who holds the beauty diploma?  And  the  pageboys  of                     about  seven  years    of    age    will  contemplate    with    open    eyes    their    little                     masters,  they  too beginning  to  understand something...  Truly,  this is  a  noble                     school  preparing  the precocious to fall in love,  and  so  many elopements...                     which  give  troubles and lunacy to  the  families since the girl's dowry is the                     illusion of beauty. Not to speak of so many bad results, which reach the terrible                     phenomenon of tragic suicides in the blooming age                               Honest  and  civil  families  are  not  supposed  to  submit  their  innocent                     children  to  such  a  principle  of  demoralization.    In    the  presence    of    such    a                     craziness causing  great  damages  to  the children  of our people,  we speak out                     complaining,    shouting  our  deep    anguish  for  so  a  great  disastrous  initiative,                     which  never began in Messina. Should it come on the day sacred to Mary?                              We reprove of this first attempt so importunate and perilous that seduces                     the sincere conscience of the teen-agers, and comes down to profanation of the                     Assumption's solemn feast.\"                           The Father insists on the profanation of the feast, which particularly calls the                     youth to contemplate the glory of Mary.  He writes,  \"Mary holds in herself the                     beauty of heaven and earth and  has  made the greatest geniuses of the  art  and                     literature  enamored  of  herself.\"  He  warns  the  members  of  the  committee                     abouttheir responsibility before God.                                                     449                           Gentlemen of the mid-August feast committee, by writing this article we do                     not  mean to offend  you; rather  we are considering the impropriety in itself in                     order to avoid damage to the simple, candid souls as well as to those who border                     the wrong paths and could be influenced by the art of the beautiful temptress                          Objectively,  however,  we  pity  you as the ones  who  live unaware in a lost                     world, in a rotten society, among people who do not want to know God,  who                     think of everything but the  mysteries of  faith,  the after life,  and the account we                     have to submit to God at the end of our lives.  God said that it is better to throw                     oneself  overboard  wearing  a  stone  that  to  scandalize   the innocent  We                     remind  you that after this life will be  a  happy eternity  for those who observe                     divine law and practice the  holy religion  of Jesus Christ.  On the other hand,                     there will be a unhappy eternity for those who live far from God and religious                     duties.                          We have sincere pity on you, and for the sake of divine charity as well as for                     the salvation of your souls, we urge  you to give up your project!                          If  you  persist in your project after we have  called  your attention  on  the                     gravity of your responsibility,  of which  you were  not  thinking,  you will find                     no mercy before God  and  the society of the honest! Rather,  if we truly desire                     the moral  and the  civil  good of your young girls,  we should teach  them  the                     saying of the Holy Spirit, \"Beauty is vain; the woman fearing the Lord will be                     praised\" (S.C. Vol. l, page l00).","14. For the souls in purgatory                              The    zeal  for  the  glory  of  God  goes  beyond  the  boundaries  of  earthly  life.                     \"Charity comes from love of God,  and bases itself on faith. When it goes beyond                     the boundaries of time, it seeks to relieve  miseries  outside this earth of exile,  in                     the    eternal  regions\"  (Vol.  45,  page  98).  Purgatory  has  endless  souls  eager  to                     transfer to heaven and praise God for ever.  Meanwhile they wail ineffably in the                     midst of indescribable torments!                           How  fervently  the  Father  spoke  of  them!    Lawyer    Romano  remembers,                     \"Once  I  listened to him preaching on the  souls  in purgatory,  and I was moved.                     If I am devout to the holy souls, it is  due  to  that  preaching.\"  When  the  Father                     described  the purgatory's  pains,  he couldn't help shedding tears;  above  all                     when  he  spoke of their being far from God,  which is  the  most painful sorrow                     for the souls in purgatory.                           God! We do not know him in this world! We are like the blind by birth who                     do not long for light, because they do not know it! On  the  contrary,  the souls in                     purgatory long for God  with  an intimate,  inexpressible  desire because they saw        450                     him  when  they were  introduced at his presence.  They saw his infinite beauty,                     the beauty enrapturing for ever the myriads of the elected; but the vision lasted                     an instant:  on and off! And yet, what deep impressions the vision of God left                     inside them! All flames in purgatory are not enough to make the souls divert their                     mind from that lovely attention. They think of God, loving him, longing for him,                     being eager for him, and desiring him. Like doves that taken into custody, they                     flutter their wings over and over the subject of their longing, but in vain. They                     cannot take off to God before satisfying his justice.                           Oh,  what  a  pain  this  is!  How  painful  is  this  state  for  the  souls!    They  are                     always on the point of taking off to God, but they cannot.  They love God,  but                     do not see his face;  they  are queens  of  paradise,  but are taken into custody  in                     purgatory; exile  is over,  but they do not enter their homeland! At least, could                     they lift up their petitions to God so that their","pains might be shortened by prayers! In vain! The souls in purgatory are unable                     to pray for themselves.  They are plunged into their bitter suffering without being                     able to help themselves! (Vol. 45, page 403).                           Hence, we can easy imagine the Father's devotion to the souls in purgatory.                     He wrote, \"I have learned that this institute nurtures  a  particular compassion and                     devotion toward the  souls who  are  in purgatory;  I will foster such a devotion                     by  often praying for them\" (Vol. 44, page ll3).                           The  Father  had a very singular devotion to  the  souls  in purgatory,  leaving                     to  us  many  prayers  for  them.  He  often celebrated,  gave alms,  fasted,  made                     penances, and preached the seven days for the souls in purgatory, as for sinners.                     He used to say, “Let us pray for them, and they will pray for us!\" To help the                     souls  in  purgatory,    he  recommended  to  say  the  prayers  having  indulgences.                     When  he asked for graces,  he always invoked their intercession; and often gave                     copious alms to say masses for them. Before starting the mass to the community,                     he used to expose the various  intentions of the celebration,  and he never  failed                     to mention  the  souls in purgatory,  especially the most  abandoned ones.                           The priestly souls were his favorite, for whom he often said seven masses;                     the last ones he celebrated were for them,  and he thanked the Lord for having            451                     been able to say all of them.                           Let  us remember some particular practices of piety he  left to  the  institute:  a                     special prayer on  Monday,  the  Gregorian  prayers  before  the  mass in the                     Lord's  and  Our  Lady's  chief mysteries  so that all souls may leave purgatory on                     their feasts: the requiem before and after the acts in common.  The Father also                     thanked the Lord because the institute felt compassion toward the holy  souls  in                     purgatory.  We quote from the rules,  \"Among  the devotions and practices of                     piety,  the prayer for the holy  souls in  purgatory   should  be  preeminent.   For                     this  reason,  the probationers  will  often meditate and read topics on  purgatory.                     The  acts  in common will end with a requiem;  every  Monday  the probationers                     will  offer  the  holy  mass  and  the  Communion  for    the  holy    souls;    and  in                     November they will offer their practices  of piety for them\" (S.C.  Vol.  l0,  page                     l68).  \"Before taking  the vows,  they  will make the pious donation (Heroic Act                     of Charity) in favor of the souls in purgatory\" (Vol. 2, page 3l).","Notes                               (l)  On May l0, l888, in a prayer of his own the Father insists imploring a priest from                     God for the salvation of Messina, \"of this people, this city, these three dioceses, these                     villages, and many souls all over the world.\" His wishes are the following: \"I expect and                     desire  him  as  the  patriarchs  and  the  prophets  expected  and  desired  your  coming  on                     earth.  I expect and desire him as your most holy Mother longed for your coming on                     earth.  I beg you to meet my expectation so that my wish be not deceived.  My dear                     Jesus,  grant me this favor I long for so much;  deign to send the salvation of these                     people; and let me see your elect and say, 'Now let your servant go in peace'\" (S.C. Vol.                     l0, page 23).                           (2)    We  should  not  confuse  him  with  Stanislaus  Cannizzaro  from  Palermo  (l826-                     l9l0), a research chemist well known all over the world for his law on the atoms and                     their reactions.  This law goes by his name.                           (3)   The  Scintilla  of  September   l,   l92l,   announced Cannizzaro's death,  recalled                     his literary merits, and concluded, \"He  kept his marvelous clear-headedness until his    452                     last,  and  he himself   spontaneously   asked  for  the  religious   comforts.\" Therefore, it                     was well known that Cannizzaro became a convert at point of death. Now, at a distance                     of  forty  years  some  would  deny  his  conversion  (N.    Falcone,  Thomas  Cannizzaro,                     D'Amico, Messina, l966). \"Many have tried to see Cannizzaro as the man that knocked                     at the Church's door, asking for the comfort of faith at his end. But,  if you read with                     serenity De la popularite' universelle  he published  two years before his death,  any                     other profession will seem unlikily,  and the attempt to show a different exposition or to                     correct his natural and acquired thought,  useless\" (page l8). \"If Father Henry De Vita                     hastened  to the dying poet,  it was due to the pious Thomas Pasqua, who was sent for                     as phlebotomist, but never by explicit will of the dying\" (Ibid.).                          To answer the Father who had asked details on the poet's death, Father Vitale took                     information  from  Thomas  Pasqua.    I  was  present  at  their  conversation.    Pasqua  was                     outspoken    in    his  affirmation    that   Cannizzaro  spontaneously  and  freely    sent    for                     Father  De Vita,  superior of the Dominicans at  Giostra.  Father Vitale remarked, \"I                     wonder  why  the  poet  did  not  send  for  Canon  Di  Francia...\"  And  Pasqua,  \"Professor                     Cannizzaro knew that Canon Di Francia was out of Messina.\" As a matter of fact, the                     Father had informed the poet that he would be absent for a couple of months. The fact                     Cannizzaro himself asked for the priest is indirectly confirmed by his sending for Father                     De Vita.  Were Thomas Pasqua to  choose,  he wouldn't have gone so far as Giostra,                     but  would have  called  a  priest  from  nearby,  such  as  Vitale,  Bruno, D'Andrea,                     Bensaia,  etc.  Conclusive evidence is the written retraction of which the Father","talks about clearly.  Surely, he must be informed by the professor's daughter.                           The contrary argument from the thoughts that Cannizzaro had expressed in his book                     two years before his death has no value. The conversion is a miracle of grace, which                     happens when God wants.   No one decides that it should  happen quite a few   years                     before death.                           (4)  Father  Vitale  was  at  dinner  together  with  the  Father  and  he  relates  that  our                     Founder ended his toast by saying, \"Luigi, hear my word; keep for us Loyola's heard!\"                                                                                                                                      453","454","l5                                                                                                     THE                                                                                       SECOND                                                                                     PRECEPT                                        l.

This is the greatest and first commandment.  The                     second  is  like  it:  You  shall  love  your  neighbor  as  yourself.    On  these  two                     commandments the whole law is based, and the prophets as well\" (Mt. 22, 37-                     40).                           The Father comments briefly and suggestively:                           \"In Jesus along with his pure love, we have to love our neighbor as ourselves                     with passionate, brotherly affection, because our neighbor is image of God, our                     fellow, and touch stone of our love for Jesus; love for God and neighbor become                     one precept including the law and the prophets as well.  This precept sums up                     Old  and  New  Testament,  the  holy  Church's  laws,  the  Fathers,    Doctors,    and                     ecclesiastical writers' works as well as the  word  that the apostles,  the martyrs,                     and  the  confessors preached in all times;  in short,  everything depends on love                     of God  and  love  of neighbor as of ourselves':  this  is  charity, charity is God,                     and God is charity\" (Vol. 3, page l66).                                                                                                               456                          Therefore, the Father establishes for his institutes:  \"Our Lord Jesus Christ's                     command:  'love each other as I loved you' (Jn.  l3,  34),  which distinguishes                     the true Christians, in this institute is a main precept like the command:  'You                     must love the Lord your God with all your heart,  with all your soul,  and with all                     your mind'\" (Vol. 44, page 20).                           \"The perfect observance of this commandment is the most effective means of                     my sanctification\" (Ibid. page ll4). \"Religion is not only worship and piety;  it is                     a practice of good works... to help the poor and the afflicted\" (Vol. 45, page 47).                           This is the program; let us see how the Father was faithful to it during his                     life.(l)","2. Since his early years                             Before reviewing the Father's charitable  activities very  briefly, we deem to                     apply to him the following words of Job, \"If I have denied anything to the poor,                     with no share in it  for  the fatherless,  though like a Father God has reared  me                     from my youth, guiding me even from my mother's womb (Job 3l, l6-l8);  for  I                     rescued the poor who cried out for help...  I was a father to the needy; the rights                     of the stranger I studied\" (Ibid. 29, l2 and l6).                           The Father gave up his life, his belongings, and the alms he received for the                     spiritual  and  temporal  charity.      He  felt  the  love  toward  his  neighbor  at  the                     highest degree, and practiced it as a  mission that God had confided to him in                     favor of the orphans and the unfortunate.   His work was manifold, copious, and                     continuous; Messina was proud of Padre Francia as of a true apostle of charity.                     Since his  youth he gave up his modest belongings, and continued an effective                     work to relieve so many miseries around him.  He was never confused by his                     own wide and deep pledges.  On the contrary, he enlarged, spread, and improved                     his  charitable  work.  Charity  placed  a  distinguishing  mark  on  him,  and  the                     institutions he founded show that he lived on, in, and for it, because Canon Mary         457                     Hannibal Di Francia is synonymous with charity.  The Servant of God himself                     gives   clear evidence in a letter he addressed to the municipal administrators of                     Ostuni, when writing about the various works of charity he ingenuously states:                     \"It is a mission I feel born for\" (Vol. 42, page 35); and to the charity committee                     of  Taormina,    \"Since  my  youth  I  have  consecrated  myself  to  the  only  end  of                     relieving my neighbor's misery, doing my utmost according to my poor means\"                     (Vol.  4l, page 43).                           We,  however,  cannot  deprive  Anna  Toscano  of  her  merit  of  having  settled                     exceptional examples of virtues to her children, which inspired our Founder since                     his tender age. According to the Father's saying, she was very inclined to works                     of charity. Every now and then she brought home a poor boy or girl in need to be                     cleaned and fed, or sheltered, and she took care of them. The two brothers priests                     sometimes  happened  to  find  no  food  at  their  returning  home,  because  their                     mother had sent it to a needy family; therefore, they had to wait for their turn.","Anna Toscano said that Hannibal was very compassionate with the poor since his                     tender age, giving them things and food as he could.  A cousin of his says, “Since                     his  childhood,  he  was  very  charitable  toward  the  poor,  and  we  had  to  pay                     attention to keep him from doing everything to them.\"                           Edifying is an incident with a beggar. When Hannibal was ten to twelve years                     old, his thoughtless classmates hastily made a poor hungry man the object of a                     joke by throwing their leftovers at him.  Mary Hannibal, distressed and caring,                     picked up fruit, bread, and everything he could carry from the table and followed                     the poor man who was humiliated by the boys' behavior.                           Delicate is the following incident.  Di Francia family had neglected to pay the                     land-tax; according to the custom of those times, a sentinel  mounted guard at                     their house's door while Anna Toscano was in the city taking steps to pay the tax                     and to remove the sentinel. Meanwhile Hannibal worried for the sentinel who                     was suffering cold and hunger; he sheltered him inside, giving him breakfast.                           To substantiate the evidence of the Father's sister, we refer another charitable                     episode which happened when the Father began dwelling in Avignone Quarter.                     He did so under the pretext that he was preaching a triduo to the most holy Heart                     of Jesus. To spare her son to return home late in the night, Anna Toscano agreed          458                     upon it and gave him two wool mattresses.  That same day the matresses changed                     owner;  two  poor  were  given  them  because  they  were  sleeping  on  the  bare                     ground.  The Father slept on the tables covered by a blanket.  As soon as his                     mother realized the fact, she provided him with two more mattresses, telling him                     that she was lending them...  It goes without saying that they also changed owner.                     Hannibal helped a very poor family, whose members were living promiscuously.","3. He saw and kissed our Lord                              What we have, and will say, makes evident that the Father's love for the poor                     was an extraordinary gift from the Lord, who destined him to a sublime mission                     of charity.  He was a father of the orphans and of the poor, as the citizens of                     Messina liked to call Padre Di Francia.  This gift was confirmed in an occurrence                     which perhaps goes beyond nature.  More than one relates the episode with little                     variations.    We  relate  the  one  by  Father  Santoro  (Bulletin,  May-August  l927,                     page l32).                           \"On the evening of February 20, l925, the padre was in his room with Father                     Santoro, who had been ordained a priest the year before.  Father Santoro tried to                     learn  something  important  about  our  founder's  life  and  his  foundation.    At  a                     certain point, the Father   added:    \"I   would like to tell   you   something...                     extraordinary..., but by now, we must keep it a secret.                           - Padre, think of it as if it were buried in me.                          - No, I won't tell you...                           Almost imploring, I began urging him through all the reasons that curiosity          459                     and affection suggested to me; for the good of the foundation, for our edification,                     for God's glory, to make us love our vocation... until he gave in.                           - I say this both to make it known how the Lord attracted me to the love of the                     poor and to edify.                           In  the  first  days  when  I  began  starting  the  foundation,  on  my  way  home  I                     came across a group of people surrounding something:  it was a stupid,  dirty boy                     salivating and  wearing rags,  whom the people were making fun of. I had mercy,                     took  that  boy  by  the  hand,  and  the  group  dispersed.  There  was  no  one  at  my                     house.    I  cleaned  up  the  boy,  made  him  eat,  and  put  him  in  bed.  Then,                     considering our Lord in that poor creature, according to divine word, I drew near                     to kiss him, meaning to kiss Jesus. At that moment, the boy disappeared from my                     sight:  I saw our Lord Jesus Christ, his glance penetrating me, and hitting me                     with tenderness; I repeatedly kissed the face of our Lord Jesus Christ. Perhaps, it                     was a vision of intelligence.                           Then,  everything  went  back  to  its  former  status.  I  provided  the  boy  with                     everything and let him go.  Since then, I have had","more  love  for the poor.  That boy was sheltered in  a  hospice; after that, I didn't                     hear anything about him.\"                        4. For the sake of God                              The Father's love for the poor is the result of his love for God.  In fact, love                     for our neighbor is a theological virtue when we love people for the sake of God,                     and see God in them; not when we love them for themselves or  for whatever                     human reason. \"We can be sure that we love God's children when we love God                     and do what he has commanded\" ( Jn. 5, 2).                           Such was the Father's love for his neighbor.  Canon Celona defined it exactly                     when he said,  \"The poor were Jesus Christ himself for the Father.\"                           The Father loved his neighbor with a supernatural love, sacrificing himself to                     save their souls.  This was the end of his labors, his orphanages, his zeal for the                     Rogate, the Pious Union, and the religious congregations.  Whatever he had or             460                     did was always directed to the love of God and neighbor.                           The environment was the waste of society, and the cases the Father had to                     meet,  were  repulsive.  They  offered  no  human  allure.  And  yet,  he  was                     continuously in the midst of the poor, cleaning, feeding, kissing their feet, and                     sharing their insects.  And to think, he was very clean by nature and education!                     But he did so for   love of God, not by natural sensitivity, which is discontinuous                     by itself. Therefore, only love of God explains the Father's strong-mindedness                     and perseverance in the midst of difficulties, oppositions, incomprehensions, and                     persecutions. He met all of them to defend the poor.                           He  used  to  say:  \"Do  you  really  love  the  Lord?  The  answer  may  be  no,                     otherwise you wouldn't feel repugnant to the ragged, wounded, and dirty man,                     since the Lord is concealed in him.\"  A sister relates: \"That his love for the poor                     was the result of his","love for God appears also from this fact:  Sister Nazzarena’s name-day was on                     August 6. On that day the Servant of God sent to her a dirty hideous old man, as                     his gift and wishes, telling her to wash his feet. The very sight of that man   from                     distance  filled  me  with  disgust.  In  the  Servant  of  God's  way  of  thinking,  that                     work of charity acquired great value because of the living image of Jesus Christ                     residing in that poor.\"                           After reading these evidences, let us read the Father's pouring out of his soul                     in a letter to Prof. Cannizzaro:                           \"My  love  for  Jesus  Christ  as  true  God  urges  me  to  obey  all  his  words,                     arousing in my heart a flame of love for my neighbor. Jesus said,  'Love your                     neighbor as  yourself'; and I strive to do so by devoting my humble life to the                     good of my neighbor, as much as I can. Jesus said, 'Give to all who beg from                     you' (Lk. 6, 30), 'What you did for one of my least brothers, you did it for me'                     (Mt.  25, 40); and I strive not to deny anyone, venerating Jesus Christ in the poor.                     Jesus  blessed  children,  loved  them  with  tender  heart,  and  said:  'See  that  you                     never  despise  one  of  these  little  ones.    I  assure  you,  their  angels  in  heaven                     constantly behold my heavenly Father's face' (Mt. l8, l0). For this reason I love                     so  much  children,  striving  to  save  them.  I  consider  that  the  final  end  of  what                     Jesus said and did is the salvation of souls. His sweating drops of blood in the          461                     garden was due to his knowledge of how many souls are lost because of pride                     and sensuality; therefore, I strive for the salvation of souls. My dearest professor,                     I am not saying this by pride, because I am nothing, but to demonstrate that love                     for our neighbor up to the sacrifice of one's own life can only subsist in the love                     for Jesus Christ God.  I am talking about the true, humble, intimate sacrifice, not                     about fanaticism which succeeds in nothing but to appear loving our neighbor.                           My  dearest  professor,  if  I  did  not  love  Jesus  Christ,  I  would  be  quickly                     annoyed by my staying in the midst of the most abject poor, depriving myself of                     everything, and by losing sleep and quiet because of the poor and children\" (S.C.                     Vol.  5,  page l2l).","5. Great and princes before God                              We have much more to say about the Father's love for the poor.                           Let us quote the judgment that the Servant of God Blessed Ludwig of Casoria                     passed on  the Father  when in their first  meeting he realized the beauty of the                     Father's soul.                           \"Indeed,  after  hearing  the  padre  speaking  about  the  Avignone  institution  at                     their  first  meeting,  Father  Ludwig,  in  both  a  serious  and  jocular  tone,  said  to                     Father Bonaventure, his associate and successor: 'What should we do? Should we                     keep him with us? He is a lover of the poor.'                           ...In  his  meetings  with  the  holy  man,  the  padre  tried  to  learn  what  Father                     Ludwig did when he could not meet his financial or other obligations. The holy                     man tried to make the padre understand that even charity had some constraints.                     The padre, who seemed unsatisfied by Father Ludwig's response because it was                     very hard for him to turn away the poor, reiterated his sentiments: 'How can we                     deny  the  poor?  'Knowing  that  the  padre's  persistence  came  from  his  love  for   462                     Jesus, the holy one answered seriously:  'How can we deny the poor? How can                     we deny the poor? If at times I, Father Ludwig, whose heart is filled with Jesus                     Christ, grieve because I am unable to help them, what can I do? There is only so                     much we can do; we must just do our best. 'Our padre confided his frustration                     with the man who knew him so well.                           The  padre  also  questioned  him  about  how  to  handle  the  poor  who  were                     reluctant to come to confession. The holy man responded: 'Don't push confession                     right away. After cleaning, clothing, and supporting a person and after helping                     for at least a month, then you can start talking about confession\" (Father Mary                     Hannibal Di Francia, page 69).                           Let us read the declaration by the Father for the Rogationists:","\"I will love and respect the poor of Jesus Christ with faith and charity,                     holding them as the suffering members of his mystical body, as well as being                     always  fully  aware  of  how  Jesus  Christ  exalted  them  by  declaring  that                     whatsoever is done for the poor, is done to himself.                          I regret that the ignorant, lost world rejects and scorns the poor, just as many                     Christians often do. I, however, will lead the poor to follow the paths of eternal                     salvation, and will hold them as great people, as princes before God, according to                     the Psalm's saying, \"their lives will be precious in His sight\" (Ps. 72, l4).  Even                     though they may be troublesome, I will be sympathetic aiding them, and helping                     them as much as I can, and much  more by  evangelizing and drawing them to                     God\" (Vol. 44, page ll4).                           The  end  of  charity  toward  the  poor  should  be  the  following.  \"Temporal                     charity  must  be  combined  with  spiritual  charity  because  the  poor  need                     evangelization. Some  of them do not approach the sacraments for  many  years                     either from laziness or from ignorance of Christian doctrine. At least on Sundays                     and feasts, before giving food, we have to gather and teach them catechism, the I                     believe,  Our  Father,  and  Hail  Mary  making  them  pray  and  approach  the                     sacraments of confession and Holy Communion. We have to bear in mind that                     our  Lord,  as  a  sign  that  he  was  the  divine  messiah,  to  the  miracle  of  his                     omnipotence added the miracle of his mercy: \"The poor are evangelized.\" But               463                     evangelizing the poor without helping them is an unfinished work. We must join                     both; by so doing, we will do a good service pleasing the adorable heart of Jesus,                     who  will  reciprocate  by  giving  us  copious,  divine  blessings;  therefore,  this                     double charity must never fail\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page ll4).                           The Father combined his teaching with good example.                          When Brother Mariano was in Naples, one morning he was told by the Father                     to dress well, because they  had to visit  marquis, barons  or princes, whom the                     Father mentioned by name. The morning instead was spent to console and help                     through copious alms some poor, one more pitiable than the other. On their way                     home,  Brother  Mariano  asked  the  Father  whether  their  visits  to  the  aristocrats                     were delayed to the afternoon. The Servant of God responded:                          - We have already paid the visits.                          - Did I need to dress well to pick up insects?                          - The poor are princes, and the insects we pick up are pearls.                          Listen to a sister: \"One day there were many poor in the","atrium  of  our  house  in  Trani  waiting  for  soup.    The  Father  passed  through                     bowing and raising his hat to them until he blessed  the food. Because we were                     wonder-struck, the Father told us, 'Are you not  yet convinced that the poor are                     the  image  of  Jesus    Christ?'  Another    time  we  arrived  to  Oria  from  Messina.                     Taken a coach  at Oria  station,  while going  to Saint Paschal's now and then  the                     Father greeted people on the right and left. By curiosity I began looking at whom                     he was bowing. He intervened:                           - Do you want to know whom I am greeting? They are our lords going to pick                     up the soup.\"                          An  employee  of  the  institutes  narrates:  \"A  man  named  Thomas,  who  was                     poor,  full of insects, and almost blind due to a lack of hygiene,  frequented Saint                     Paschal's.  One day,  the padre called  me:                          - Tell me,  Marchese,  do you want to help yours who died in the earthquake?                          - Yes, Padre, I do.                          Then,  arm  in  arm,   he presented the wrecked man  to  me, saying:                          - He  is  greater than a king and and  emperor,  because  he represents Christ.                          - Well,  I  and a helper  drew a nice warm bath for  Thomas, and  the  Servant                     of God gave me brand new clothes of his own  to dress the poor.\"                          More  than  once  Thomas was cleaned  and  clothed   by  the Father,  but he                     used to sell the new clothes drawing back to  his former  state.  In spite of that the                     Father continued his work of charity.                                                     464                          Charity  bound  the  Father all his  life  long:  he  loved, clothed  well the poor                     as they were Jesus  Christ,  kissed  their feet,  and  waited on them.  His walking                     with cripples and  needy persons was moving. In the early times, returning from                     begging he happened  to  give up everything to the poor before reaching  the                     institute.    Wearing  an  apron,  he  himself  sometimes  cut  the  poor's  hair  and                     cleaned from waste material.                          A  Religious  remembers  the  times  when  he  entered   the institute.  \"He                     had  the  honor  to often  eat  with  the  poor, sometimes  picking  up  a spoonful                     from each of  them.  He  often washed  their  feet  and sometimes the  whole                     new-comer.  I was horrified by the","sight of a foul soiling poor sitting  at  table after the Father's invitation. But he                     pleasantly remarked that my repugnance would disappear at my full entrance in                     the order. 'You are a novice,' he said.\"                           Father    Vitale    points  out  that  the  Father  \"could    not    live  without    the                     emotions caused by these cases naturally  repulsive, but supernaturally pleasant.\"                     \"Several times I saw foul repulsive poor  entering  the  Father's room and going                     out clean  and  well clothed. He himself took care of them, because on the side of                     his bedroom there was a bath.\" A brother put aside a cup for the poor because                     one  of  them  had  used  it.  When  the  Servant  of  God  realized  the    fact,      he                     strongly  reprehended  the  brother  making  him understand that the poor are our                     lords  and  we  should  have  no  fear  of  their  hands  and  lips,    unless  they  are                     infected.  Furthermore, the Father kept that cup for himself and even though the                     repented brother  asked  the cup for his own use,  the Father  denied  his request.                     The  poor  were  bathed  with  warm  water  and  well  clothed  by  him.    Often  he                     delivered  no  clothes  to  the  laundry  at  the  end    of  the  week,    because  he  had                     donated them to the poor; if questioned about it, he used to smile.                           Besides  the  daily soup,  the Father used to order  a  full dinner for the poor                     on the chief solemnities.      I remember how cordially,  intimately,  and deeply                     joyous he was  on those occasions.  He waited on them,  begged the poor for                     some spoonfuls from their plate,  then ate, laughed, and talked in their   midst.         465                     Together  with  them  he  toasted  to  the  saint  of    the  feast,    our  Lord,    and  the                     Madonna wanting us to be proud of that day  because  princes,   marquis,  and                     barons  had  honored  our refectory.                           His last heart beats were for the poor.  He said:  \"Lord, at least some of the                     prayers  said  by  people  for  me  may  help  the  poor  having  no  inheritance  to                     affections.\" Some days before his demise he  recommended  Father  Vitale to                     financially    help    the    poor,  mentioning    many    names  and  establishing  the                     amount to be  given. Father  Vitale reports what the Father said in  his  illness.  \"I                     have come to terms with the Lord.  I have asked him to apply only a fifth of the                     prayers said in our institution for my healing and a tenth of those made by other                     religious communities. I asked the Lord  to  rechannel the remaining prayers for                     so    many    suffering  poor    who  have  no  one  praying  for  them\"  (Father  Mary                     Hannibal  Di Francia, page 34l).","6. True heroism                              It  was a well-known fact in Messina that the Servant of God picked  up some                     spoonfuls from the poor's plates to form his  own plate.  Furthermore,  he  often                     ate  in the  same  bowl  of  the nauseating  poor.  After  teaching  the  Christian                     doctrine  and feeding the poor of Avignone,  the Father often changed his plate of                     pasta  with oil (prepared for his delicate health)  with  the plate of a suffering                     poor. A sister relates:  \"In Oria the Father commanded  the  mother  superior to                     prepare a  good  dinner   for several  gentlemen,  the following day.  By his order                     we  brought about the best dishes and napkins. At the set time, about 30 poor                     peeped  in.  Two of them,  the most ragged,  were chosen  by  the Father  to  sit at                     his  sides;    we  were  astounded  and  looked    each  other    in  the  face  in  silence,                     Father Palma and  Mother  D'Amore included.  At  a  certain point I realized that                     one of  the  poor sitting on the Father's side was discharging phlegm in the plate.                     As soon as the Father noticed that,  he changed his dish with the poor. By some                     invincible repulsion I burst out, Madonna mia! By a gesture  the Father silenced                     me.  After dinner I plainly said  to him:  'If I become a saint,  I want to be  clean,                     not dirty.' He laughed  at that,  putting his hand on my head.\" The same  sister                     relates:  \"One day he invited me and Sister Gertrude to observe a mortification in        466                     honor of the child Jesus.  We agreed upon it. He led  us to a slum where a poor                     man was lying ill in an impressive state:  plenty of bugs had even gnawed his                     head.  We  transferred the man in a tent of sheets we had pitched,  and while we                     sisters disinfected  the  slum the Father drew a warm bath for  the  poor man,                     giving  him  lingerie  and clothes brought  from  the  Holy Spirit.  Lifting the                     edge of a sheet,  I saw the Father bent over the feet of the sick man. I think he                     was kissing them.\"                           One  day,  the Father knew from a newspaper that a poor  old woman  was                     lying abandoned in a slum at Gravitelli.  He sent  two sisters to see. It was a                     repulsive place. He ordered to clean the woman along with her slum and hired a                     maid to help and serve the sick woman until a vacancy be available at the Little                     Sisters'.","These,  however,  were  afraid  of  sheltering  her,  because  she  used  to  cry  in  the                     night; yet, when she was sheltered, she stopped crying since the first night. The                     Father said, \"Didn't I tell you that  her crying depended on hygiene?\" The sister                     continues,  \"I could  refer endless cases which prove that the Father's  charity                     toward his neighbor was from God's charity. His care for the poor and the care he                     demanded of us was supernatural: he saw the image of  God in the poor,  and  he                     wanted  us  to  console    him.    Besides  cleaning,    clothing,  and  feeding  he                     questioned  the  poor  about  the  state  of  their  conscience,    personally  providing                     them with proper instruction.\"                           The  mother  superior  of  Taormina's  reports:    \"One  evening  the  Taormina                     sisters were waiting for the padre at a  pre-determined time,  but he did not come.                     The next day,  they knew the reason.  While  going to the Messina station by                     carriage,  the padre saw a poor,  wretched man lying on the ground. He was so                     impressed that he stopped, took the poor man back home, bathed him, fed him,                     and  called  a  barber  over  to  shave  him,    regardless  of  the  sisters  who  were                     waiting in Taormina.  Then he put him to bed and  drew  the attention of the                     Little Sisters to shelter him.  We knew all this from  him,  who  with  simplicity                     and  angelic  smile  concluded, Obviously,  adorned as I was with pearls (the                     poor's insects),  I couldn't come over here to share them with you'.\"                           One day, an old, poor, ragged, foul man knocked at the door. He  said that           467                     Padre Francia had invited him to lunch.  I informed the Father:  he got up, put off                     his skull-cap, bowed to the poor, and made him sit at his own chair.  I must have                     made a wry  face, because the Father looked at me severely.  Then he asked the                     poor what he would like to eat.   'What Vossia want,' the poor said. I brought                     macaroni,    meat,    cake,  fruit.  At  the  end  the  Father  told  me  to  prepare    a                     combination of food in a box.  He took away  the napkin  he  had  placed  to  the                     poor,      said    the    prayer,    and  accompanied    him    up  to  the  door.      Then  he                     lectured  the  mother superior  mildly.  'If your spouse Jesus had come here clean                     and well  dressed,  you  would have given him a great  welcome.  Now, however,                     he  has  come  under  the  shape  of  a  poor  (and  what  a  poor!)  and  you  made                     grimaces.  When will you understand that  the poor are Jesus Christ'?\"                               Incidents of this kind were frequent, and Father Vitale describes them with                     vivid images.                           Sometimes  he  surprised  the  superior  by  saying,  \"Please  prepare  a  special                     dinner  because  I  have  invited  a  gentleman  that  cannot  be  disregarded.\"  The                     superior,  wanting the occasion  to stand out,  did her best.  When everything was                     ready,  the  padre opened  the door to let in a  poor pitiable wretch;  this was the                     gentleman  he  wanted  to  be  honored.  Later,  the  padre  used  to  clean  and  dress                     these  people  in  order  that  they  might  appear  with  a  certain  decorum  (Father                     Hannibal Di Francia, page 343).","The  mother  superior of Taormina vouches:  \"An  old   woman  named                     Peppina used to knock at the door with her walking  stick; pretended  to receive                     the alms from the Father only (when he  was in).  When  I  raised my objections                     she opposed that the work  of mercy done by a saint was light and consolation to                     her.  One  day she  did  not appear.  Some days later the Father  perceived  her                     absence,  and  because  I  gave no reason he scolded  me  for  my indifferent                     behavior.  Finally,  I  received information of  her hovel  and went to find her                     with other sisters.  Musty smell  and wastes  kept  us on the threshold.  Then we                     cleaned her  and  the hovel, putting things in order. Afterward, me or a butler                     used to bring  her the food to much satisfaction of the Father,  who  was joyous                     for  our  gradual  improvement  in  the  true  works    of    mercy.  Following    his                     suggestion,  we invited the poor woman to transfer to   our  guest-quarters,   but                     she  declined  our   invitation, preferring  to  die in her own hovel.  She died in                     the  hospital instead, and our orphans participated in her funeral.\"                          \"One woman had an abscess on her neck.  Because no one had treated her, the                     growth was spreading and had an unbearable smell.  To get rid of her, the poor                     used  to  give  precedence  to  her.    After  she  left,  I  did  not  see  her  any  more.  I                     wondered if she had died.  Later I happened to hear that the padre had found her                     lying on the ground.  Having mercy, he took her to the hospital in a carriage.  She                     was the same woman who wandered here and there because of her unbearable                     smell.\"                                                                                   468                         7. To my dear Lords, the poor                              In the following chapters we'll talk about the Father's alms to the poor;  now,                     we point out that his lavishness to them  was perhaps  the only reason for being                     criticized many times,  and so cursorily.  People said, 'He is a good man, even a                     saint,\" and that was the common opinion,   \"but he goes","blind  by  heart,    and  ill-intentioned    persons  take  advantage  of  him.\"  In  a  few                     words, in their opinion his poor were a rabble of idle and exploiters.                           Complaints started from the poor themselves,  but  for quite opposite reasons.                     They  did  not  feel  satisfied  according  to  their  real  or  imaginary  needs.    A                     gentleman says, \"I  myself once had to intervene in order to defend the sisters                     distributing  bread.  They  were  insulted  by    the  beneficiated  who  were  never                     satisfied.\"  So many  times  the  more beneficiated insulted to him  and  to  the                     brothers  distributing alms,  but he forgave them,  warning about their  wrong                     against God and men.  He demanded of us to  do  the same.                           As to the Father, these complaints were a reason to continue perfecting his                     work  of  evangelization.    He  addressed  a  letter    to  the    poor  in  his  last  years,                     calling them,  \"My dear lords,  the poor.\" He recommends them to moderate their                     requests according to the moral principles to which they have to conform their                     lives so that providence never fail.                           To my dear lords, the poor: l. You must be convinced that it is  impossible  to                     satisfy your needs  with copious alms  because the  lords  poor are by thousands                     and to satisfy all  of  them  a fountain  should run gold money.  2.  Canon Di                     Francia's and his sisters' direct duty is keeping the two orphanages of Messina.                     They have to build what the orphans need, which requires a lot of money, and              469                     we  are  running  into  a  great  debt.    3.    Some  of  the  lords  poor  appeal  to  Saint                     Anthony's providence.  Saint Anthony's providence is to satisfy the orphans in                     everything and we can hardly give little help to the outsiders.  To tell the truth,                     we couldn't even do that.                           Obviously, he had to talk to the poor in such a way. Practically,  however,  it                     was  easy  for  him  to  give,    and  to  give  copious    alms,    since    he  was  only                     mortified for being unable  to give more. The Father continues:                           4.  I let my lords, the poor, know the reason why poverty increases and what                     they must do to deserve help from God: a) they shall not blasphemy God. b) If                     they have children, they shall not set bad examples with blasphemies, bad words,                     and fights in the family.  c)  They shall not get drunk.  d)  They will receive                     Communion  with  their  family  at  least  once  a  year  and  on  the  chief  holidays,                     always avoiding mortal sin. e) They shall not curse at their neighbor.  f)  They                     will say the rosary in family every evening; the prayers in the morning and in the                     night.  g)  They shall not covet their neighbor's goods.  h) they will work, work,                     work,    each  one  in  their  profession.  They  should  not  say,  \"I  have  no  work,\"                     because work does not fail the honest and those of good will! They should work                     every day! Lack of work depends on lack of will,","and such lack could be a punishment from God for incorrect behavior...  i)  They                     should  live with the holy  fear  of  God, avoiding  sin  and  thinking of saving                     their souls and  those  of their relatives.  The persons who neglect the salvation of                     their own souls and of theirs', cannot pretend help from God. The world is going                     into ruin and poverty is increasing because men and women do not keep their                     religious duties, are oblivious of God, and are sinning in many ways.  Some of                     them think of excusing themselves by wearing the picture of Saint Anthony, or                     the  Heart  of  Jesus,  etc.    Something  else  is  needed,    i.  e.,  complying  with  our                     duty.    The  superstitions  of  good  luck  charms  are  useless,  rather  dangerous,                     because God is offended! Without the blessing of God we have hungry, misery,                     and  misfortunes,  because  God  does  not  bless  those  neglecting  their  religious                     duties, or having a dirty conscience.                           We read in the Scripture:  \"I never saw the just begging bread.\"  Why, then, so                     many  are  begging  bread?  Should  I  say  it?    Because  they  never  approach                     confession and Communion; or they are addicted  to  wine,  or something else...;                     or  they    covet    their  neighbor's  goods;    or  they  do  not  respect  God,  say  bad                     words, and tell lies in order to cheat people. God, however, sees everything and                     becomes angry over lies and deceit. Therefore, my dear lords, the poor, keep in                     mind  theses  warnings  from  your  friend  and brother  in  Jesus  Christ,  Canon  Di                     Francia. Always keep the law of God and the precepts of the Church, behaving                     according to these warnings. You will see that God, Jesus Christ our Lord, will           470                     make peace with you, helping you in everything ((S.C.  Vol. l0, pages ll6, ll7).                         8. Without compass                             After  reading the Father's warning to his lords,  the poor, we now come to the                     people  who  charged  him  with  bad  administration  because  of  his  lavishness  of                     alms.                           The  Father's  principles about charity were  far  off  from common  standards.                     Referring to his meeting with the Servant  of God,  Father  James  Cusmano,  the                     Father  relates  the  ideas    that  Father  Cusmano  expressed  about  charity  on  that                     occasion.  Writes the Father, \"I asked whether in the charitable institutions one                     should follow calculations, counting income and expenses, as in a","common administration,  to proportion one's expenditure to  one's income  for                     the    good  to  be  done;    or  one    should    be    informal,  trusting  in  God.  He                     responded,  'When  I  didn't  follow  compasses,  I  saw  miracles'!\"  (S.C.    Vol.    9,                     page l47). The saints did so. If Cottolengo,  Don  Bosco,  Don  Guanella,  Don                     Orione  would  have followed compasses, they wouldn't have succeeded as they                     did.                           Listen  to the Father about his work: If  I  had taken the compasses as a cool                     administrator    from  the    time  I    began  sheltering  abandoned  children,    first  I                     would not  have  bartered my little  things;  second,  to  balance  the sheltering                     of  the  poor  abandoned  orphans  with  the  meager contributions,  I  would  not                     have  formed  the  institutes.  Any enterprise requires initiative and impulse, but                     when the matter is about orphans who get lost day after day, then initiative and                     impulse are even more urgent.  In Messina we have two orphanages that shelter                     many children, giving them an education, life, and safety;   instead of getting                     lost, these children found their right path.  Why should I extinguish the flame or                     instinct that drove me up to here? (Vol. 45, pages 459-460).                           The  Father never used compasses,  but opened his  heart  to everyone without                     worries.    Someone  rightly  states,  \"He  was  not  an  organizer,    but  a  genius  of                     charity,  living  in  it;  he  disregarded  this    sublunary  world,    whose  bonds  and   471                     limits he ignored;  hence the obvious reactions of ordinary administrators.  He                     always went  straight on charity's road, and when people insulted him for this                     behavior, he did not listen to them, or laughed at that.\"                          The Father defended the poor in the open. \"While begging and receiving alms,                     he often used to say to the benefactors, 'You are rich  to  help  the poor,  who are                     beloved  by  God'.\"  A  mother superior  once  told  the Father that  the  poor                     speculate.    The  Servant    of  God  responded,    \"We  should  believe  the  poor.\"                     Father Drago  sought  to  screen the poor,  after information  of  third persons.                     When he asked the Father's advice he was told, \"Don't be too  particular.  If a rich                     humbles himself by asking  alms,  his humiliation is a sign of need.  Give to all,                     and with discretion when  the  matter  is about gentlefolk who have  fallen  on                     hard times.\"                          When  we opened our house in Altamura,  a beggar knocked  at the door.  The                     Father washed his feet,  clothed him anew, and fed him  despite the sisters had                     informed him that the beggar  was  a blasphemer.  The Father warned them not to                     speak against charity, and  told them that he expected the beggar's conversion                     from that work of charity. Then he addressed two orphan girls, \"Do you want to                     make a sacrifice? Give your cherries to this beggar.\" They did so willingly.","Father Drago reports, \"Once, an old man told the Father, 'My heart has a desire to                     smoke; it has been so long since I smoked.' And the Father 'Blessed you, why                     didn't  you  tell  me  before?  What  do  you  smoke?'    'That's  a  question  for                     gentlemen,' said the poor man,   'I will be happy with anything!'   The Father                     quickly  ordered  five  cigars.    I  objected  that  one  should  not  foster  vice.  He                     responded, 'This also is an act of charity. Would you take his vice away at his                     age?  Rather, when he comes, give him a Toscano in secret'.\"                           A sister remembers: \"I was a seller of bread. One day during the  l9l5  war a                     lot of women came in begging  bread.  Since  the police  arrested  a  few of them,                     the Father went  on  the  roof crying,  'Please  leave  them,  leave  them,  it's  a                     matter    of  hunger'!\"    \"On    another  occasion,    because  a    ruffian    slapped    a                     merchant,  the  sisters called the police.  When the guards  were taking the well-                     known fellow to jail,  the Padre happened to pass by  and  began  mediating by                     saying that  the  incident  happened because  the  man was hungry,  that he would                     see to it  that  the fellow  would repent and avoid bigger problems.  The guards                     went away exclaiming, 'Padre Di Francia! We should handle people of this kind.'                     The  Padre  began  dealing  with  the  man's  soul  and  his  needs\"  (Father  Mary                     Hannibal Di Francia, page 346-347).  Says Lawyer Romano,  \"I remember the                     Servant  of  God's  magnanimity  with  a    certain    man  that  under  the  pretext  of                     winning    a    diploma    in  English    language  tapped  him  for  money.    When  I                     warned him about, he responded ingenuously,  'I am aware of that,  but a good             472                     time will come when he will achieve the diploma'.\"                        9. Apology                              We have already seen how the Father reacted to the charges of being lavish                     with  the  poor:    he  did  not  listen;  he  sometimes  laughed  at  that.  Once,                     however,  he defended himself openly.  It happened in l906, on the occasion of                     an illustrious visit to his orphanage for","girls. He freed himself from several charges, among which the one that he was                     helping the poor.  it is worth  reading his apology.                           Some persons charge me with helping the poor.  To tell  the truth,  this  charge                     hurts    me  because    helping    the    afflicted,  miserable,    abandoned,    dying    by                     starvation and  cold  weather, cripples, blind, and unable to work is a duty for all                     Christians, even when they have to  make an effort;  in fact,  our Lord   Jesus                     Christ taught us to do to others what we want be done to us. They say:  \"But you                     have no means to help them, because you have to take care of the orphans.\" To                     these persons I answer: \"Never have  I  deprived  my  orphans of anything in                     order to help  the  poor, because  I  obtained  the means from public charity  and                     I  have experienced  that a supreme providence,  in whose  presence  both rich                     and  poor are equal,  always provided me with the means  to give  a  dish  of food                     and some bread to the  most  derelict  and needy.\"                           They respond that I help beggars who are able to work. I say to them: \"Please                     come  to  my  institute  at  lunch  time;  you  will  see  the  pool  of  Siloe  full  of  old                     feeble people, either blind or cripples, or drooping by starvation.  I assure you                     that I held some of them who had fainted from starvation. If some of them are                     unemployed, it is due to lack of work.  Will the society condemn these to death                     because they lack work? Charity and humanness dare not nor they deny them a               473                     piece of bread.\"                           These persons insist that some of the poor steal and cheat me. What can I say?                     It is possible that a rascal conceals himself under the guise of extreme poverty                     picking up a dish of food and a piece  of bread.   What a great thing!   But, I                     cannot put into practice the saying, \"so that the guilty person may not be saved,                     the  just  must  perish!  So  I  cannot  deny  a  piece  of  bread  to  so  many  unhappy                     persons for fear that a rascal is concealed among them!  They steal!  Please tell                     me, were you never robbed?  Did human fraud and simulation never take money                     from your pocket or safe box, your vigilance and shrewdness notwithstanding?                           Perhaps  I  am  striking  a  discordant  note  that  revives  gloomy  memories  to                     you!...  So I beg you not to charge me so easily if a beggar who is doubly poor                     happens  to  be  in  the  midst  of  so  many  unhappy  people  when  I  try  to  give  a                     helping hand.  Society took no care of him when he was a little beggar or rascal                     abandoning him to himself, so he took a wrong way. Will society condemn him                     to death today? At least, may he find a gentle breeze of peace in the breath of                     celestial charity which is able to get him back to a better counsel! (Vol. 45, page                     462).","10. Hunting the poor                              In  the  last years of the nineteenth century and the  first ones  of the twentieth,                     in Italy people clashed openly with  the beggars. They said, \"It is a shame for a                     nation so progressed and civilized to see men and women begging in the streets.\"                     What was the  remedy?  Instead of remedying the social wound  with  proper                     means, they wasted no time: they put in prison the beggars caught in  the  very                     act.  Several newspapers of Messina  had  begun  a campaign  against the poor.                     The Father felt the horror  of  this social injustice,  and his heart was broken. He                     mailed a circular to  Messina's publishers defending the poor,  and  entitling  the                     document,                                                         Hunting the poor                       Dear publisher:                                                                           474                           As  other  publishers have through their presses,  you  have attracted  police                     attention  to  the  poor  that    we    sometimes    see  begging    in    the    streets.                     Unfortunately, the results  of  this campaign have been dismal for the unhappy                     impoverished.                           For   a   year,   we  have witnessed  the hunting   of  the  poor.  Relentlessly,                     policemen  spy  on every move of  these  miserable creatures who are sometimes                     old,  sometimes crippled,  or feeble, or  sick,  or unable to work.  As soon as an                     officer sees one  of them  turning  the corner or crossing the streets,  he takes                     him into  court  where a judge finds him guilty of  disturbing  civic peace  and                     condemns  him to one to six  months  in  prison.  The unhappy  person,  guilty                     only of being poor,  is locked in  jail, like  a criminal,  being punished for an                     average of two to  three months before he is set free. Then he faces this dilemma:                     whether to  die of starvation on a street corner or whether to beg  again risking                     law's wrath.                           The  powerful  instinct  of  self-preservation  prevails,  and  the  poor    man  is                     compelled to beg again.  Once again, the policeman takes him to court where a                     greater punishment is imposed on him for being a second","time offender.  He re-enters jail, is set free only  to come back,  and the cycle                     repeats itself.  Eventually he gets used to not eating or hangs himself to put an                     end to it.                          I know some people who are in and out of jail constantly!                          A  district  judge  also assured me that he had  sent  about sixty poor to jail!                          Everyone    sees    that  this  punishment  against  the  poor    is    a  true  social                     injustice.                          We  can  say  it  is  the  law  that  condemns  them.    Yes,    the    law  condemns                     troublesome begging and young beggars who like to harass people  and perhaps                     to impose on them instead of working.  But it is  quite a different matter when a                     feeble,  old man begs with  a charitable  voice asking for a piece of bread so he                     does not  die of starvation like a dog.                          That unhappy man is a human being just as we are;  he  feels the  needs  of                     life  as we do.  He  knocked  at  the  charitable institution's  door in vain;  he was                     told that there was no place for him,  that there were too many requests and not                     enough  room; therefore, he asks for public charity.                          Where  is  the  problem  here?  Does  being  a  poor  person correspond with                     being a criminal?  If so, why did Jesus come into the  world  to  teach  us to love                     each  other    like    brothers    and  sisters?  Why  did  he  want  to  embrace  poverty,                     defend the poor, and declare that what we do for them is done for him?                          Some could say, \"isn't it advantageous for the poor to go to jail  for  shelter      475                     and  food?\"  We  answer  this  question    by    asking  another.    If  you  were  in  the                     situation of that poor person, would you  prefer being prosecuted and condemned                     to six months in  jail rather  than enjoying freedom?  Surely the poor locked in                     prison have  little  chance  of eating a good dinner and sleeping   on  a well-                     padded  bed.  They  receive some soup and a piece  of  black bread which they                     could get through charity.  If this is the case, let them eat this bread without the                     bars and iron doors; let them sleep  soundly  upon their own straw mattresses                     without  the  six months jail sentence and the gloomy future before them.  The                     poor need so many things,  but let them enjoy the free sun,  free air, and free                     horizon,  especially today when there is so much freedom for everyone.                          The more we consider this serious social injustice, the more it terrifies us.                          I have lived among the poor for many years.  I can prove  my claims with                     facts,  documentation, and examples. For instance, in my  male institute I have                     sheltered a poor man who was a  garbage collector   all  his  life.   He  performed                     his  job  with  such application and fulfillment that he is worthy of admiration.                     Now he is a tottering,  disabled,  old man.  Because my asylum is for children                     and its finances are limited,  I can give him only  room and  board.  To live,                     however,  a man needs other things besides food.  This old man is helped by                     some  benefactors  who  give  him    a  soldo    (l/20  of  a  lira)  on  designated  days.                     With this he is able to buy a few shirts,  some shoes, and tobacco. A month ago                     he was going out of","the  front  gate  of  one of  his    benefactors    when    a  policeman  took  him  to  the                     magistrate. His tears and protests were useless: he was condemned to a month of                     prison.                          Please,  what crime has this unfortunate one committed?  Who can  impose                     punishment when there is no crime?  Does this  penal code exist in any nation?                     Surely this is not what law means!                          If begging is a crime for the poor, then those who give alms are aiding and                     abetting in their crimes.  These criminal partners include the chief of police, the                     judges who all have had mercy on the poor and have helped them many times,                     and me.                          You can take all the poor in the world into custody; you can trap  and  drown                     them.  You will never be able  to  destroy  the feeling   of   charity   that   drives                     people   to   help   the underprivileged.  There will always be beneficent hearts                     willing  to  feed  the  hungry,    to  clothe  the  naked,    to  consider  the  feeble  and                     abandoned poor as brothers, and to feel the sweet consolation of helping them.                     You are unable to destroy the poor because the condition of human life and the                     organization of human society are such that the poor cannot   disappear  entirely.                     Jail,   trial,   or  other  means notwithstanding,  these words of the gospel will                     always be  true: the poor will always be with you.                          Instead  of  turning against the poor  beggars,  instead  of impairing  the  state                     and/or provincial finances by  keeping  the poor in jail,  open a new asylum to           476                     shelter these unfortunates in Messina.  But  it  is a sad comment on our city  that                     charitable institutions are not very well understood.                          As winter comes,  it will be worse for the poor. If they are not allowed to beg,                     what  will  they  do?  By  the  irony  of  fate,  the  two  public  dormitories,  which                     sheltered about eighty people, have closed.  During  the  summer those poor men                     and women  spent  the nights  in the open.  Will they be able to do the same in                     winter when it snows? If they beg to sleep under a shelter, they will be taken,                     judged, and condemned.                          Dear  sir,  disregarding  religious principles that  perhaps divides us,  I think                     that  you  are  inclined  to  have  mercy  on  these  vagrants.    I  appeal  to  your                     humanitarian feelings and ask you  to state through the press the exact meaning                     of 'illicit beggary' as well as to give legal exemption to the feeble,  unfortunate,                     and old  poor  people.  They  are  unable to  work  and/or  they  are crippled.  In                     spite  of  their various requests,  they  are  not sheltered in any public asylum,  in                     the Collereale poorhouse,  at the  Little Sisters' house,  or at the Pious House.                     They do  not deserve  inquisition  or prison;  instead they deserve  pity  and help.                          The  sad,  abandoned  poor  have no lawyer  to  defend  them properly,  and                     they  have  no newspapers to look  out for  their interests.  They  are society's                     outcasts,  considered unworthy of life.                          These thoughts may move your generous feelings to take a stand","behind  these  weak,    oppressed  poor.    Practicing  the    noble  virtue  of  charity                     deserves God's blessings and man's.                                                                                           With the utmost respect,                                                                                                      Your servant,                                                                                      Can. M. Hannibal Di Francia                            Several  newspapers  reported  the  Father's  circular,    and  some  of  them                     commented on it very favorably.                           \"We  have  received from holy Canon Di Francia  this  letter which  is  the                     most sincere and  high  expression  of  Christian charity. He has been victimizing                     his noble life for the suffering human beings\" (L'Alba, September 7, l899).  \"The                     blessed Canon Hannibal Di Francia  has mailed to us the following article which                     always  better  reveals his angelic heart and his  love  for  the suffering  human                     beings.  They find in him a great apostle of Christian charity, unlike some fat and                     big liberals\" (L'Ordine, September l4, l899).                          The  Father's intervention turned out to be very  beneficial to the poor.  Says                     Father  Vitale,    \"His  article  was  so  impressive  that  the  questor  permitted  the                     poor's begging.\"                          Another initiative of the Father,  however,  who was grieved by a painful view       477                     in Bari, was not crowned with success. We quote his letter from Altamura   to Il                     Corriere delle Puglie, on February 2l, l9l8.                           On the occasion of the regrettable death of Oronzo  Rosselli nicknamed   U                     Rizz,  your newspaper published vibrant articles  to censure human, wild acts of                     brutal  street-urchins.  They  oppressed  the  poor  wretch      with  insults  and  ill-                     treatments up to the cemetery, inducing a grave suspicion that they drove him to                     the grave by making him drink a poisonous beverage.(2)                          The noble aim of the press is:  to fight evil, to foster goodness, to be zealous                     for the rights of human beings, the most pitiable included.                          Owing to this reason I feel obliged to call your attention upon events similar                     to Oronzo Rosselli's, to which I witnessed on the eighteenth of this month in the                     distinguished city of Bari.                          I  was  going to the station Bari-Matera around l:00  p.m. with  my friend                     Canon Carmel De Palma of Bari,  when in a  street near the station we saw a                     pitiable,  afflicted poor surrounded by a gang.  They were scorning and vexing                     him. A few of them pulled him by the edge of his ragged jacket, others bumped                     into him, and others threw wastes at him.  The victim was furious, crying, and                     struggling. We approached and consoled him, giving some money. He was very                     thankful.","At our entering another alley near the station, we witnessed a similar incident.                     A new gang of precocious criminals was squawking, insulting, and ill-treating a                     half-wit beggar.                           At that view I could not refrain myself from reprimanding those rascals, as                     they deserved.  Meantime the half-wit  beggar went  away,  perhaps  to  find  a                     worse  gang  and  harder  ill-treatments.                           Dear  editor,  to  put an end to these indecencies in  Bari, which  is  a  pearl                     among the Italian  cities,  please  call  the attention  of the citizens.  For the sake                     of humankind, for the sake of God in whom all of us are brothers and sisters, let                     us  seize  the  occasion  of  the  unhappy  man's  death  by  poison  to  defend  the                     unfortunates  who  are  undergoing  troubles.    At  least,  may  the  little  criminals'                     actions against them come to an end.                           Let us vindicate the pitiful memory of Oronzo Rosselli by impeding that other                     people undergo an unfortunate fate!                           You  and the gentlemen who are powerful for their conditions and relations be                     concerned with the few tramps and the old feeble beggars;  defend them from the                     bad,  oppressive  instincts of the inconsiderate  boys;  see to it that they  may be      478                     sheltered,  or provided and protected.\"                           Then he recommends the inconsiderate boys. \"While we pity for the victims                     of the unbridled, vagrant boys' reckless cruelty, we also consider these unhappy                     little  torturers.    Idleness,  abandon,  and  vagrancy  make  them  so  cruel  and                     inhuman.  If a helping hand pushed them, if a civil authority recruited them for                     work and moralization, many of them would turn out to be honest citizens and                     workers.  They too have some natural tendency to do good.                           Returning to the few tramps, he writes, \"If my request is proper, I dare beg                     you  to  raise  a  subscription  in  the  Corriere  delle  Puglie  to  help  the  most                     unfortunate and needy of them, at least until Easter.                           If you raise such a subscription, I pledge 25 liras\" (Vol. 4l, pages l39-l40).                              The Father asked the editor to publish the article, but all in vain; nor the                     subscription was raised.  The lay mentality  of that  time   was openly against any                     interference of religion  and clergy,  keeping people from giving weight to an                     initiative of  a priest, who was, furthermore, a stranger.","Notes                              l.  \"Religious  and  social action of Cardinal   Dusmet  and Hannibal  Di  Francia,\"                     thesis for doctorate  by  Father  Joseph Borraccino R.

The holy mission of giving                               The Apostle Paul's saying, “I made myself all things to all men in order to                     save at least some of them\" (l Cor.  9, 22) was the Father’s and his institute's                     program.    For  this  reason    he  sought    an  endless  charity.    \"The  Daughters  of                     Divine  Zeal  will keep  in  mind that the Pious Institute of the interests  of  the                     divine  Heart has been born with the mission of giving.  The more we give,  the                     more the Lord will give us,  because he said, \"When you give one, you will be                     given a hundredfold measure and eternal life.\"  And  elsewhere,  \"It is better to                     give  than    to    receive\"  (Vol.  l,  page  2l4).  One  day,  the  Father  said,  \"If  I                     unfortunately happened  to know in paradise that the practice of charity  fails in                     one of my daughters,  I would ask the Lord the permission  to come  down  with                     a rod to flog her.\"  Reporting  this  saying,  a sister gave the Father's reason,                     \"Because by lack of charity  we remove divine providence from the institution.\"                           In the early days of the foundation, besides the promises of chastity, poverty,                     and  obedience the sisters novices also made the promise of charity and of prayer                     to obtain good workers.  The Father  wrote  for  the  Rogationists,  \"They  will                     nurture    and  practice  the  spiritual  and  temporal  charity  toward  their  neighbor   482                     through  the  work  of  religion  and  beneficence,    which  are  the    aim  of  this                     institute.  Bewaring of afflicting whomsoever,  they will console  and comfort                     everyone with holy words and financial help, as much as they can.  They will                     practice a special charity toward those  who  happened to offend or contradict                     them,  avoiding  to avenge themselves\" (Vol. 3, page 23).                          What are the institute's specific works?  Those performed by the Father,  and                     the  other  ones  that  providence  will  allow  in  the  proper  time.  All  of  them  are                     related to the Rogate:                           Our maxim:  \"Pray,  therefore,  to the owner of the  harvest that he will send                     out workers to gather in his harvest,\" urges us to continuously","pray, asking God for the good evangelical workers to the holy Church, and to                     perform the works of charity we can do by   divine  help.  Up to now,  these                     works  are  the  education    and  salvation    of  the  abandoned  orphans,    and  the                     evangelization  and help  of  the  unfortunate,  derelict poor.  They  are  two  holy                     missions we must care with faith and love\" (S.C.  Vol.  l0,  page l96).                             The Father's program,  however,  was a larger one, as we see from  his                     answer  to the question  about  the  new  foundations. \"According to the means,                     the circumstances, the invitations, the buildings,   the   contract,   etc.,   we  can                     open  orphanages, kindergartens,   laboratories  for  outside  students,   boarding                     schools from elementary schools to colleges.\" The Rogate urges us to  work  in                     any field of the spiritual and temporal  culture  in order to win souls to the most                     holy Heart of Jesus, for his glory and  consolation.\"  For the Daughters of Divine                     Zeal  the  Father adds,  \"Asylums  for  the poor,  hospitals,  and  any  charitable                     institution for boarding and outside women\" (Vol.  l,  pages l85-l86).                          It goes without saying that the Father recommends the study.                           If we have smart students with the opportunity to attend the universities,  we                     should  encourage  them;    they  could  help    other  sisters    to  obtain  teaching                     credentials,    and  to  form  a    boarding  school    recognized  by  the  government.                     Teaching many young  women would  be a great good,  which would help the                     institution of  the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                                             483                          Those  responsible  for the studies  will  accept  wholesome young girls of                     twelve years,  who show signs of vocation, to lead them  to  the  study.  Because                     they are  young,  they  have  the potential to achieve good results (Vol. l, page                     l54).                       2. His alms                              Writing  the  life of Saint Peter Damian,  his  teacher  and spiritual  master,                     Saint  John of Lody says of him,  \"Who  could  number the works of charity he                     did  in  so  many  ways?  Who  could  win  him    in    the  practice  of  giving  alms,                     washing the  poor's  feet, clothing the naked,  feeding the hungry,  and visiting                     the  sick? Circumstances","or time permitting,  he was always engaged in such works\"  (Saint John of Lodi,                     S.  Pier Damian e i suoi discepoli, Ediz. Cantagalli, Siena, page 59).                          These statements about Saint Peter Damian seem a  beforehand picture of the                     Father,  as we have seen in the previous  chapter. Now we are about to talk about                     his giving alms,  whose praise the assembly recounts (Sirach 3l, ll).                          From  the  appendix  to  the  original  constitutions  we  quote  the  following                     teaching:                           Aware  of the command and the exhortations of our Lord Jesus Christ \"give to                     everyone  who  asks  you\"  and  \"give  the  remainder  to  the    poor,\"    the    pious                     institute of the  Rogationists  will  be generous toward the poor,  the afflicted,                     and the derelict.  The kitchen soup for the poor will never fail in each institute,                     and  after    providing  the  community  with  everything,    a  dish  of    food,  some                     bread,  and  some money will be given to all the  poor  who knock  at  our  door,                     taking into consideration  their  age  and ailments.  Helping  the poor this way or                     giving them  clothes  or other  forms  of charity after providing the community,                     will  be done  with joy because the apostle says,   \"God delights  in  the people                     who give with joy.\"                          Alms  must  be  given  in  the  spirit  of  faith,    remembering    our  Lord    Jesus                     Christ's promise,  \"you will receive a hundred  times more\" and \"give to others,                     and God will give to you:  you  will receive  a  full measure,  a generous helping,       484                     poured  into    your  hands  -  all  that  you  can  hold.\"  On  one  hand,    we  have  to                     provide the  means  of living for us and the institutions;  on the  other hand,  we                     have to keep our divine Savior's  saying,  \"giving  is better  that  receiving...\"                     Believing  in  our  Lord  Jesus    Christ's  words    will  remind  us  that  he  said,    \"                     Whatsoever you do  to  the least of my brothers, that you do unto me.\"                          To    foster    the    practice    of  alms  and    charity    toward    our  neighbor    in                     different  ways,    we  quote  the  touching  words  of    the  Holy  Spirit  through  the                     prophet Isaiah (58, 7-ll):                          \"...(Is  not this the sort of fast that  pleases  me...)  To let  the oppressed go                     free,  and break every yoke,  to share your bread with the hungry,  and shelter the                     homeless poor,  to clothe the man you see to be naked, and not turn from your                     own kin? Then will  your  light  shine like the dawn and  your  wound  will  be                     quickly  healed over.  Your integrity will go before you and  the glory of Yahveh                     behind you.  Cry,  and Yahweh will answer;  call, and he will say,  `I am here'.  If                     you do away with the yoke, the clenched  fist,  the wicked word,  if you give                     your bread to  the hungry,  and relief to the oppressed, your light will rise in the                     darkness,  and your shadows become like noon.  Yahweh will always guide  you,                     giving  you relief in desert places.  He  will  give strength  to your bones and you                     shall be like a  watered  garden, like a spring of water whose waters never run                     dry\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page ll3).","Talking  about  the Father's alms,  we find ourselves in  an endless field...                     We pick up a few sheaves.                           Evidences  of  his  love  for  neighbor  are  numerous   and concordant.  \"We                     would need volumes to answer properly.  We asked ourselves,  'Where does the                     Father find the money to quickly face all    the needs of things and persons?' He                     did everything for  the sake  of  the Lord.  He spared no effort  with  words,                     counsels,  examples,    helping    the  people  in  their  needs.    One  day  is  hardly                     enough  to  report  such  things.    He  gathered  and  sheltered  orphans,  fed    and                     clothed the poor,  and made any sacrifice to  help  the sick.\"                           Our  houses  had the daily soup kitchen for  the  poor.  The Father himself                     tasted the food,  and unless it was  tasteful,  he reprimanded those in charge of it.                     Our institutions work for the poor.   A  priest notes,  \"It is worthy considering                     that male and female poor knocked at his institute's door every day,  receiving                     soup,    bread,  and  some  money.\"  \"Every  day,  at  the  Holy  Spirit,  we  provided                     hundreds of poor with soup,  200 kg. of bread, and money (we were running the                     mill  at  that  time).    Because  the  prefect    of  the    county  could  not  believe  the                     report,  he himself came to get the   evidence  on  the  spot.   When  the  Father                     visited   his communities, he himself provided the poor with alms more generous                     than the fixed ones.  Pointing to the kettle of the soup for  the poor, the Father                     once said playfully, \"This contains alms for the poor; and when we give them the          485                     boiled food, it multiplies.\"                           It was a refrain in Messina:                           These are Padre Di Francia's seats,                          Whoever arrives sits down and eats.                           One  day,  the  Servant  of  God  heard  it   and  playfully completed it thus,                     \"Whoever arrives,  sits down,  commands,  and eats...\" He said, \"We have to give                     the poor what they desire.\" To tell the truth,  the best dishes were for the hungry,                     and his new clothes, or the best at disposal, for the naked.                           Sister  Eugenia  remembers that the Father called  her,  and said,  \"From  now                     on,  you will prepare linens,  keeping them  in store; when the poor ask for it, you                     will give some of them. They must be given new linens.\"                           How    glad  he  was  when  he  was  able  to  make  a  surprise  to    the  poor!                     According  to a sister,  one morning in September l925 the padre  saw  some nice                     peaches on the trees in the garden  of  the Holy  Spirit.  He told a sister to please                     pick some up and  bring them to his room.  To please the padre, the sister chose                     the best","ones and laid them on his table.  At noon,  he told the  superior,\"They  chose                     these peaches for me;  but in the parlor there  are many poor; let us go there and                     give them the fruit to eat.\"                           We  report  additional  relations.  \"In each  house  he  had clothes of his own,                     but he gave them almost always to the poor he had cleaned and freed from bugs.                     The poor were his lords... I had to  deal with a deaf blind woman who had lived                     among low  people. As usual,  the Servant of God welcomed and entrusted her to                     me. I became depressed several times because she said bad words to  me, but                     when I informed the Father,  he  was moved and said to Mother Maione, 'We                     must teach that old woman!' Every time he went to San Pier Niceto,  he always                     asked about a weak-minded woman sheltered in our house.  On the main feasts,                     she ate with us, sitting near the  Father.  To  keep  a coachman from cursing,  he                     gave  him  a generous alms.\"                           Back  home  and tired for his apostolate,  one  evening  the Father  asked                     whether we had brought the food to a poor  who  was unable  to  pick it up.  The                     person in charge was  mortified  and sorry  for his forgetfulness.  Grieved,  the                     Father enrolled  his dinner  in  a  napkin,  and brought it  under his mantle  to  the                     poor's slum. \"As a waiter, I often saw him giving his own food to some poor,                     because we had nothing.\" A sister cook remembers that the Father commissioned                     a special dish for some days. She thought it  was for himself and only the third          486                     day she realized  that  he brought  it outside in a small pot.  Confidently,  she                     asked him, \"Please tell me to whom you bring the food;  or else,  I will not cook                     it any more!\" Kindly, the Father told her that he brought it to a poor living in a                     hut near the Holy Spirit.                           A  former  orphan remembers,  \"Several times he told  me  in secret,  'Louis,                     tonight you will go late to bed.' He went to the sisters' cylindrical revolving tray,                     got some cans of petrol, and we went around the slums.  We lit the lamps, gave                     the soup to the poor,  and he recommended them to pray, and to accept things                     with Christian submission.\"                           \"Now  and  then,  the  Father  told  us  to  deliver  clothes  to  some  poor  he  had                     visited  before.    In  cases  of  necessity,    he  sheltered  them  at  the  Little  Sisters,                     paying himself the monthly tuition.\"                           It  is impossible to inquire into his giving  alms,  because not only his left                     hand  did  not  know  what  his  right  hand  had  done,  according  to  the  gospel's                     saying, but even his right hand did not","know how much it gave.  We shouldn't worry about expenses for the cure of the                     sick and for the help of the needy, even if we had to pawn a house or to sell the                     furniture of the church.                           A Religious remembers,  \"I saw the Father the first time  on Easter,  at Saint                     Anthony's.  At his arrival, the poor surrounded him,  and  he gave alms to all of                     them without checking the value of the lira bills.  His spontaneous,  generous,                     universal charity touched me.\" His love for God and neighbor was  boundless.                     While going to the station,  he once gave his shoes to a poor,  and was compelled                     to return home by coach.\" An old man told two Daughters of Divine Zeal at the                     station,  \"You are the sisters of that holy padre,  who  was  so kind to me! Once                     he gave me an alms  of  500 liras without checking it.\"                           \"He  often invited me to perform works of charity by saying, 'Do you want to                     visit that poor,  or to bring   help for the sake of  God?'  First of all,  he helped the                     people by  words  and  by setting  examples of Christian life... He gave alms,                     clothes, and suits,  often  asking me to find or to buy the merchandise.\" More                     than once he gave up some of the clothes he was wearing,  or  his handkerchief.                     \"For instance, his watch ended up in the hands of a man who manifested to him                     the needs of his family.\"                                                                                                               487                          He  called  the  poor  princes,    barons,    marquis,  and  following  his    own                     possibility he gave them alms according to  their  needs and  state.  He  often                     gave the poor many articles  of  his  own clothes  despite  the complaints of the                     sisters..  While  giving generous  alms,  he did not check the amount,  rather he                     told us, \"May your left hand ignore what your right hand is giving.\"  \"For the                     good  of the poor and the orphans he installed a mill and  a bakery of pure wheat,                     giving  bread  to  the  poor  gratis;  the  others  bought  it  at  a  reasonable  price.\"                     \"Because  I  was  a  seller  at    the  bakery,  the  Father  often  asked  me  for  bread,                     money,  and  something  else    for  the  poor,    on  the  spot.    He  said  that  even  a                     hungry man cannot easily swallow bread alone.\" The coach-man of our house in                     Trani  remembers,  \"He  was  also a saint for  his  giving  alms. Wherever we                     passed by, the poor crowded round the coach; he used to knock with his umbrella                     to make me stop, and gave the beggars alms over and over again.\"","3. Anecdotes                              Without claiming to exhaust the subject, we glean additional episodes of the                     Father's charity.                           It  was well-known that an old woman of Oria,  sitting on  a rock  under  the                     window  of the Father's room called  him  in  a plaintive and ingenuous voice,                     \"Come down, Papa Annibali, I want you.\"  The  Father handed an envelope with                     money to  one  of  us, saying  playfully,  \"Give this to the old woman of Papa                     Annibali.  So    many    times,    however,    the  Father  himself  gave    her    linens,                     money, and food from the window.                           Father Carmel reports:                           One  day,  during the winter of l9l0,  in Oria,  we had only bread  and dry figs.                     When able,  the sisters of  Saint  Benedict helped us with something else.  A poor                     knocked at the door asking help  for  himself and his family.  Questioned by the                     Servant  of God,  I responded that we had only bread and dry figs.  He became                     annoyed and told us to provide the poor with something else. When he suddenly             488                     perceived that the poor was a former butcher, he said that  we  could give him a                     year old lamb we  owned.  The  butcher could sell it for his own needs.  Being                     affectionate to it,   the orphans became sad,  but the Father told them, \"What? Do                     you want to give an offering to God as Cain, not as Abel?\" The poor  liked this                     kind of music, and some days after he came again to beg. The Father gave me                     five liras for the poor;  but he did not deign  to accept the offering.   When I                     informed the Servant of God, he said to me,  \"What?  Does he want a cow? Tell                     him we haven't any.\" The poor was satisfied with the five liras.\"                           \"The    Father's  generosity  to  the  poor  was  almost    deranging.  Some    old                     workers  of our garden in Oria were  given  bread  and something  else  in  the                     morning.  The Servant of God  found  our treatment lacking and ordered warm                     milk and coffee,  which  would be  good for the old men.  First,  they were proud                     and satisfied, but  shortly after they asked to turn to the previous","treatment,  because,    they  said,  their  stomachs  could  not  stand  with  milk  and                     coffee. The Servant  of God told us,  'Well, add  more bread, fruit,  and cheese.'                     Father Palma remarked,                          'Or  the  first,  or the second treatment.'                          'Both of them!' Said the Father.                          In l9l7  a crowd of people was asking for bread at the  Holy Spirit's,  but  the                     police  had  forbidden  distribution    of    bread  because    of    the    war.    From  the                     crowd came out an  elegant  lady asking some bread for her children in the name                     of God.  Policemen were  watchful and impeding,  therefore the Father  shrugged                     his shoulders.  At  a  certain point,  as inspired,  he ran into  the house, came out                     carrying a bread divided into two sandwiches with two meat balls, and gave it to                     the lady. He suggested to her, \"If police question you, you say, 'Father Di Francia                     gave his food to me. He has the right to do so'.\"                          When  the  Father  realized that the sisters  of  Oria  were parsimonious in                     giving alms,  he asked the reason. They responded that it was due to the hard                     times of the post-war. The Servant of God  told  them,  \"Women of little faith!                     You must not be  stingy with the poor!\" Soon after help and offerings increased.                          The mother superior of  the house in Francavilla Fontana                     wrote,                          I was transferred to Francavilla Fontana with the orphans in l909 because of                     the  earthquake.  Even  though  the  necessities  never  failed,    we  were  still  poor.                     One day,  a poor  man knocked at the door,  begging. For  lack of faith, as the           489                     padre told me later, and taking into consideration both our needs and that we had                     no  alms to give,  I convinced myself to send him away. While the poor man was                     sadly walking away, the padre happened to arrive.                           He asked me: \"What have you given the poor man?\"                           My answer was the following:  \"Padre, we have nothing in the house; all the                     more, many poor knock at the door daily and we are not able to meet all their                     requests because the house is poor.\"                           He disliked my way of speaking,  and showing his disapproval he said, \"I do                     not believe that you don't have anything. But even if  you don't,  you should have                     given him that bottle of oil that is over on that table.\"                           I  answered:  \"That  oil  is for the lamp  for  the  Blessed Sacrament; I put it                     over there to be saved.\"                           He looked at me and said:  \"You have no faith; otherwise you would  have                     given away half of that oil.  Now you need to","atone. For nine days you will give a plate of soup and some bread to the poor                     who knock at the door at any time. Never send away any needy person.   In   the                     meantime,   pray  to  the  Holy  Spirit   for enlightenment.\"                           The  next  day,  the charity novena began according  to  the padre's  rules.  It                     seemed that the Lord was pleased because  so many poor came in those days and                     all of them had their needs met. Likewise,  the Lord provided us with everything                     so that we  could face them.                           Frequently,  our  founder gave his dinner to  an  unexpected poor  person,  or                     to a crying boy,  or to someone else because he felt  that  his  dinner was too rich                     for    him.    When    the    Father  returned,    he  asked  me:    'Have  you  done  your                     penance?'  I  answered  in    the  affirmative  informing  him  that  despite  the  many                     poor  we helped abundance came in.  He was delighted.  At my question  how                     should I behave with the poor in the future, he responded: 'I set no  limits for the                     poor;  you give as much as you can.' He always told us:  \"Never send a poor                     away without giving an alms.\"                           Another  witness.  \"Usually,  I  was  in  charge  with  visiting  the  poor  at  their                     dwelling,  and I had to inform the Father of  their moral  condition.  In  those                     days,  one hundred liras  were  his ordinary  alms.  To  help  the  outside  poor,                     he  made  use  of registered letters which were so many that sometimes I had to           490                     go to various postal offices to avoid overloading one employee.\"                           While  giving alms,  the Servant of God also considered  the decline of the                     gentlemen,  paying  special  attention to them and fixing  a particular time.  The                     gentlefolk who had fallen on evil days  enjoyed the kindness of the Father's heart                     and were  helped at their own dwelling periodically and in secret.                           Let  us  read  additional  reports.    One  morning  I  saw  Adolf    De  Meo  very                     afflicted and desperate because he had no means to pay a bill.  The  sum needed                     was considerable and the time for  payment was  expiring that day.  I thought of                     appealing to the Servant of God;  therefore,  I  hastened  to manifest the case  to                     him.  He thanked me for giving him the opportunity to do a work of charity to  a                     good father and family, and handed to me the sum needed  by Adolf.                           Unable to fulfill his obligations, a poor gentleman of Trani  approached the                     Servant of God at the rail station, submitting the","case  to him.  The Father took him by the sisters' coach  to  the institute,  let  him                     eat,    and  gave  him  a  sum  of  money.    At    the  gentleman's  saying,    the  sun                     dissipated the clouds of his  spirit that day.                           Lawyer  Trisolini  of Oria once told me that Don Ruggero  De Angelis,  a                     declined lord of that town,  was generously helped by the Father. To correspond                     such  a  generosity,  he  thought  of  making  the    last  will  in  favor  of  the  Father,                     leaving to him  the  only property he had: a little house. No sooner said than                     done, and he gave his will to the Father in a closed envelope.  Shortly after, Don                     Ruggero changed his mind and had recourse to Lawyer Trisolini to  have back                     his will.  At least,  he should have behaved better not to lose the Father's help...                     One  day  when  the  Servant  of  God  was  passing  by,    Lawyer  Trisolini  let  him                     know the fact.  'Please give me five minutes,  I go to Saint Benedict's and return,'                     the Father  said.  Handing  the  envelope  with the  will  to  Lawyer Trisolini,  the                     Father  asked  him  to  assure  Don  Ruggero  that    the  ordinary    help    would    be                     increased and maintained all  his  life long.                           Writes Father Vitale:                           \"Those  who  did  not dare to get mixed  in  with  the  poor because  of  their                     former high status had a  special  reception; others  received  some money for                     their immediate  needs  such  as light,  soap, etc.... The padre always helped them       491                     with his purse both full and empty\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page                     343).                           I  myself  heard from Knight Musico'. \"One winter  drizzling evening I met                     the Father with Brother Mary Anthony in the street, carrying a load under their                     mantle.  I asked,  \"Father,  what are you doing in the street at this hour,  with this                     cold and  rain?' He responded,  'We cannot think of cold and rain when a family                     is starving at...  They do not dare to come to me;  so, I must go to them.'   Prof.                     Gazzara  relates,  \"People  of former  high  rank appealed  to  the  Father,   who                     sometimes  entrusted  me   with confidential  commissions.  I was told that he                     gave about l00.000 liras to a family in one year.\" He himself waited for a month                     on Lawyer Cipriani of Rome,  who was  expelled from his house by his own                     sons.  When they repented and called their Father back,  the Servant  of God paid                     the fare for Cipriani and told me to  buy  a brand new suit and a silk cap,  the                     ones the lawyer liked.  \"With the  people of middle class fallen into poverty the                     Father used a special  reception:  a  separate room and  table  ware,  'because                     charity,'  he said, 'shouldn't be an occasion of mortification'.\"                           One  time he bought cherries of bad quality at  high  price, but","recommended  to  eat  the  good  ones  only.   Father  Drago questioned  him,                     \"Then,  why   did   you  buy  them?\"  The   Father answered,  \"Be silent,  you                     inquisitive person. I had to help that poor seller.\"                           Canon    Bembi    of  Oria  writes,    \"The  servant  of    God    treated  everyone                     kindly,  had good words for all,  and the needs of  all resounded  in  his heart.                     Several workers were employed  in  his institute, many poor found a daily help,                     and Canon Di Francia was revered as the Father of the orphans and of the poor.\"                           Father Carmel reports:                           On  one occasion the Father wanted to hire a jobless man  in our  institute of                     Oria,  but I objected that we had no  need.  He told me,  \"We need to practice                     charity.\"  \"But we have no money!\"   I  replied.  \"But  this is the very reason,   we                     hire  him,'  he explained.    \"Thus, we urge providence to help us.\"  This is not the                     common law of administration.  However,  if we live on faith, we  cannot  do                     otherwise.  How many people appealed to  Padre  Di Francia!                           Writes  Father  Vitale:                           In  Messina,  there  were  several  people  who  formerly  held  high  rank    but                     because they had had hard times,  came to the  Avignone Quarter or the Holy               492                     Spirit,  especially late in the  evening.  On the  whole they did not dare to appear                     begging. All of them  were sure  they  would find a helping hand in the  padre.                     They  asked questions like:  \"Padre, can you find a job for me, so I can earn a                     living for my family?\" He thought and considering the status of people he would                     say,  \"We have already a door keeper, but you can help him\"; or,  \"I have no need                     of employees, but  you can put the library  in order.\" Sometimes he asked the                     poor if they had jobs. Then  he  tried  to invent them as if he were the  mayor  or                     the prefect  in that miserable place called Avignone,  of  which  St. Francis of                     Assisi would have not been envious. But that place was the  cradle  of  the  great                     Anthonian  institution  (Father  Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 343).                           To   give  a  present  to  a  community,   the  Father   had commissioned a                     statue from an artist of Carovigno,  and he talked about it with Mr. Palazzo, one                     of our sisters' brother. He was an expert  on  the subject.  Mr.  Palazzo asked the                     price,  and  the Father said how much it was.   Father Drago spoke up:  \"It's  too                     much!\"  Mr.  Palazzo  confirmed  that  the  price  was  too  high.  Shortly  after,                     however, the Father called  Father Drago, questioning him, \"Who","asked  your intervention?  Thus,  we cannot do a  piece  of charity...  If I want to                     help a poor man, people tell me that the price is too much, too high.\"                           One  day  during  l9l3,  a Religious was told to  enclose  a thousand liras bill                     in a letter.  The Religious held up the  bill to  make  the  Servant of God sure that                     the bill was  a  thousand liras worth.  \"Yes,  he said,  \"be not afraid.  I want to                     give    a  thousand    liras.\"  The  next  day,    the  Father  called  the    Religious  and                     showed to him a letter with an offering of two thousand liras from a benefactor,                     and  said,    \"Man  of  little  faith;  yesterday  we  gave    a  thousand  liras,  today  we                     receive two thousand liras!\"                          An  almost centenary poor woman neglected in a village  near Messina was                     far from the sacraments.  The Father sheltered her in the best room at the Holy                     Spirit, where a sister could assist her with care and love by day and night.                           Paying a visit to her every day,  he asked if everything was right;  because                     she  was always happy,  now and then  the  padre praised the sister,  adding: 'I                     commend her to you; the only work I  require of you is that you serve her well                     and see to  it  that she never be alone.' The padre placed a bell on the table so that                     she    could    call  someone  else  in  her  assistant's  absent.    On    her  hundredth                     birthday,  he invited her children and  grandchildren, who were poor,  to eat with                     her and told the sisters to kiss  her hands  in homage to God who granted such                     old  age.    When  the  woman  died  twelve  days  after  the  celebration,  the  padre   493                     ordered fervent suffrage\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 349).                           From  the report of his sister Teresa we quote  an  incident which happened at                     the start of the institution.                          \"The  day  of  Epiphany,  the Father was on his way  to  the cathedral for the                     pontifical mass when he met a sick  weak-minded old  woman,  whom the rascals                     were making fun of her.  The Father drives away the boys,  calls a coach,  and                     takes  her  almost  dying  to    the  hospital.    Because  the  hospital's    employees                     refused  to admit  her,  he  asks  them to take provisional  care,  runs  and submits                     the  emergency case to the  prefect.  The  admission  is granted  by authority.                     The  Father    returns  to  the  hospital  to  be  sure  of  the  admission.  That  work  of                     charity was a mystical golden offering to the child Jesus on the Epiphany feast.\"                          We  quote  the  Messina  Gazette     on  the  occasion  of  the committee to                     honor  the  Russian  Admiral  Ponomareff,  who  along  with  his  soldiers,    saved                     many persons during the l908 earthquake  and in  l92l   became  a  victim  of                     Bolshevism.      Because    of    that  circumstance  he  asked  a  helping  hand  from                     Messina.","Our  padre was touched by this hero of charity  and  ordered his  communities                     of  Religious and orphans to  save  a  thousand liras. He sent this money to the                     impoverished admiral and wrote a letter  that the \"Gazette\" published to foster                     the generosity  of others. We quote:                           Dear editor:                          Canon Di Francia,   his fellow-members,   sisters, and orphans  pledge   with                     favorable disposition a thousand liras  coming  from their   daily  sacrifices  in                     favor    of    the    deserving    Admiral  Ponomareff,    who  along  with  his  men                     hastened to help Messina  in the  earthquake  of December 28,  l908,  saving                     many  lives  from underneath the ruins of the city\" (S.C.  Vol.  5,  page l0l).                           The Gazette of February 22, l92l commented,                           These  are the words of a man of heart and noble spirit  who finds  a  way  to                     help even when the circumstances  would  impede everyone  from  doing so.  His                     institute's    burdens    should    have  exempted    him  from  meeting  our  request.                     Instead,  he  cooperated very  generously by even imposing a mortification on his                     orphans. May the  noblest deed of Canon Di Francia be a stimulus to  those who                     are to take away only something from their surplus.\"                           Some  days  later a new donation from Canon Di  Francia  was announced in            494                     these terms by the Gazette\" of February 24, l92l:                           From  Canon  Di Francia's inexhaustible generosity  we  have received  an                     additional offering:  two silver snuff-boxes,  which the benefactors had donated                     to his orphanages, have been given to our subscription. We renew our best thanks                     to him.                           At Oria, a woman had given birth. She was lying in pain on a bed  with no                     sheets when the Father happened to pass by.  He  was called by her children.                     \"Father  Hannibal,  our  mother  is  sick.\"  He  entered  the  house,    consoled  the                     woman,  and blessed her. The day after he returned to hear her confession and to                     give Communion to the  woman who was already relieved,  providing the  family                     with food and clothes. Children were given several gifts.","In  Trani  a child happened to cry under the window  of  the Father. He                     sent a sister to inquire: the child was hungry. Moved, the Father gave the child                     his own food.  But, as he knew that the eight  members of the child's family were                     in the same  condition, he ordered to give them food every day,  to relieve them                     from the rent of the house,  and provide them with clothes. Then he saw to it  that                     they  be instructed in Christian doctrine  and  in  the observance of holydays.                          To  make  peace,  especially  when  the  matter  were  the  girls,  he  often    and                     willingly shouldered the families' troubles  even  by helping  them financially.                     For instance,  I know of a family  of Genzano (Potenza); husband and wife were                     fighting. She came up to Oria to receive generous financial help.                        4. For the prisoners                              Because    they  need  more  help  and  redemption,    the    prisoners  drew  the                     Father's charity in a special way.                           He often visited and helped the prisoners of Trani.  I think that he also ordered    495                     the mother superior along with her community to  do the same.  Accompanied by                     other persons,  now and then  he brought the dinner to some of the prisoners,                     while  we  made  cakes  for  them.  He  also  administered  the  sacraments  in  the                     prison.                           Because    the    district  prison  in  Taormina  was  on  the    ground  floor  of  the                     Capuchin former convent,  whose first floor was  set aside  for  the  sisters,  the                     assistance to  the  prisoners  was easier.  After  taking  care  of the prisoners'                     preparation  for Easter through preaching,  confession,  and mass, the Father used                     to offer the dinner to the prisoners on that feast, as well as on the  Christian  chief                     holidays.  When a prisoner happened  to  be sick,  he was assisted with daily food                     according to the  doctor's prescription.                           Someone says that also the personnel of the prison was given dinner,  after                     interesting,  effective  religious  instructions. Around  l903,  the  community  of                     Taormina  inaugurated  the  new kitchen.  When the mother superior informed                     the Father, he asked, \"For  whom  did you cook first?\"  The mother  superior                     answered, \"For","the  prisoners and the poor.\" The Father delighted  in  it, smiling. He had been                     well interpreted.                           As  soon as he arrived to Taormina,  he paid the first visit to the prisoners,                     who  became  affectionate  to  him,  longing  for  his  coming.  One  day  when  the                     Father was begging in the town, a former prisoner went himself begging as a sign                     of  his  gratitude  to    him.  Another  day,  an  imprisoned  boy  shouted,  \"I  did  not                     intend to kill him!\"  As a matter of fact,  he was involved in a casual homicide                     during a fight with another boy.  The Servant of God succeeded to make him                     understand his wrong;  therefore, and to beg pardon from the Lord.  From his                     window,  the Father once threw down a pair of trousers  and  other articles of                     clothing to a  prisoner  in  the courtyard.  He collected other supplies in his room,                     just in case of additional charity.  As a conclusion of this subject, we quote two                     evidences.  They are significant to the persons who knew  the Father personally.                     \"No  needy  person  contacted  the  Father  without  receiving    comfort.\"    \"The                     Servant of God spent his days  helping the  people  in their soul and body;  he                     wove good works  in  his life; and no one went away without receiving comfort.                     He was like a candle enlightening and warming.\"                                                                                                                 496                     5. For the consecrated souls                              Priests    and  religious  communities  in  need,    above    all  the  claustral  ones,                     were a particular object of the Father's charity.                     He  wrote for us,                           Helping  those  who belong directly to the Lord such as  the priests and the                     religious communities in need pleases God at  the highest,   attracting   his  best                     promises  of  retribution  and celestial blessings.                           We  cannot help being touched and generous toward those  who belong  to                     our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,    completely    trusting    in    the  prophet  Malachi's  divine                     promise, \"Bring the full tithes and dues to the storehouse so that there may be                     food in my house, and","then  see    if  I  do  not  open  the  flood  gates  of  heaven  for  you  and    pour  out                     blessing  for you in abundance.  For your sake I will not lay a strict injunction on                     the  locust  not  to  destroy  the  fruits  of  your  soil  nor  to  make  the  vine  in  your                     field’s barren,  says  Yahweh Sabaoth. All the nations will call you blessed, for                     you will be a land of delights, says Yahweh Sabaoth (Mal. 3, l0...).                           When Msgr.  Parrillo came as Apostolic Visitor,  the Servant of  God  had to                     give an account of  his  lavishness.  He  cleared himself by writing,                           I have the duty to submit to you,  who represent the highest authority,  a  way                     of  behaving  which somehow  seems  a  little strange.  Specifically,  how I have                     been behaving since more than forty years that I am working in the charitable                     institutions.  I have always been taking a great care of the orphans and the poor,                     and that's fine.  But,  I have had the presumption to financially help  not only my                     works,  but also the good works of others;  not only  the  persons  sheltered in                     my  institutes,  but  also  the beggars, and above all the religious houses. I placed                     my trust in the divine promise,  \"You will receive a hundred times more\";  as                     well  as  \"give to others,  and God will give to  you:  you  will receive  a  full                     measure,  a generous helping,  poured into  your hands - all that you can hold\"                     (Lk.  6,  38).                                                                                                               497                          As to his helping the religious communities,  he quotes  the above lines  by                     Malachi, and continues,                           \"I  considered  my  giving  as  the  secret  to  be  always  helped  by  divine                     providence:  my trust in God was never disappointed.  Our Lord,   in  his  infinite                     kindness,  overflows  us  with  divine providence.  So I can say that my donations                     are not inconsiderate in  relation  to my institutes and their  members,  because                     they never  lacked anything.  We spend today's superabundance  on  the divine                     providence's bank without waiting for tomorrow\" (Vol.  29, page 46).                           In fact,  he wrote to Father Vitale, \"Let us spend the money on  the  bank  of                     our Lord,  who applies the interest rate  of  a hundred per one and never becomes                     bankrupt\" (Vol.  33,  page 52). To Mother Nazzarena,  \"Let us give good alms;                     they are the  best investment\" (Vol. 36, page l3).                          As to his behavior toward the poor priests, we quote several evidences.  \"By                     personal    experience  and  by  assertions  of    still  living  brothers,    I  say  that  his                     charity  toward  the  poor    priests  was    special,    continuous,  and  discreet.    He                     provided them  with money,  gave  them  hospitality  in  his  institutes,  and                     added additional proofs of his charity to those who had neglected their priestly","character  along with their duties.\" \"Caring for  their health or for their return to                     the Church, he paid frequent visits to the sick priests or to the ones who had gone                     astray,  comforted  them    with    his  prayer,    and  gave    them    generous    help.                     Father Bonarrigo  often said,  'The Father has gone to Gualtieri for the confession                     of the priest'...\"  \"He was special to the priests who had  gone  astray,  as  well  as                     to  the  poor  ones.\"  A  sister remembers,  \"I  prepared  dinner for almost two                     years    to    Pastor  Chille'  and  Chaplain  Carnazza  responsible  for  the  cemetery.                     Both of them were alone. The latter was assisted until his death. When Pastor                     Gentile  fell sick,  he enjoyed the Father's care for his soul and body until his                     death.\"                           We know from Father Carmel that the Father was  particularly generous to the                     poor priests.                           Such  a  charity  was  very  discreet.    On  these  occasions,  while  asking  for                     money,  he used to say,  \"I have to do business.\"  One day  we  were traveling                     from Oria to Rome.  He asked me for  some money  for  a  poor  priest who was                     on  the  train,  but  he  was disappointed because I had a hundred liras only,  for                     the  return ticket.  Despite my objections he demanded all of them. He handed                     them to the priest in an envelope. A gentleman sitting on my side asked  me who                     that priest was,  and I told him.  He was amazed at seeing Canon Di Francia,                     whom he knew by hearsay.  He opened his bag,  picked  up an envelope,  and put            498                     some money  in.  When  the Father  came back,  the gentleman poured out his                     devotion to  him and as a token of his feelings he handed to him the envelope                     with a  thousand liras.  The Father commented,  \"If we had given fifty liras, we                     would have received five hundred liras; we have given a hundred liras, and the                     Lord has sent a thousand liras'.\"                           A former friar priest was living in Oria. He had fallen into poverty,  because                     his  nephews  and nieces  had  squandered  his riches.  The Servant of God knew                     of him from Father Palma and was moved.  Even  though he censured the former                     friar's behavior,  he immediately  said that he was a priest in need and  therefore                     he should be helped at any cost. He gave him all the money we had at home.                           Lavish    was  the  Servant  of  God's  generosity  in  favor  of    the  religious                     communities.  \"I closed my eyes,\" he wrote, \"especially when  the  matter  was                     helping the Religious  and  the  religious houses\" (Vol.  29,  page 47).  At the                     Servant of God's death, the","mother-house    of  Messina  used  to  send  the  amount  of  l30,000  liras  a  year  as                     ordinary  help  to  many  monasteries  and  religious  houses.  Besides,      each                     community had its own list of communities to  be helped,  either  they were in                     the list of Messina,  or  not.   The  mother  superior  of  Taormina had sent  a                     hundred  liras  to  the Dominican  sisters  of Bologna,  after their  request.  When                     the sisters  responded  with a letter of thanks,  they asked  for  an additional help.                     Amazed,  the mother superior of Taormina talked with the Father,  who told her,                     \"Do you eat only once?  They are enclosed nuns:  give them a hundred liras a                     month.\" The community of Taormina used to send  a hundred liras a month to                     the  Morning Star Sisters,  in Naples,  but the Father  once said to the mother                     superior,    \"Send  them  200  liras  a  month.  Don't  you  remember  their  tottering                     house?\"  Because  some  registered  letters  from  our benefactors contained more                     money than it was declared, the Father said,  \"Why don't you do the same?\" And                     sometimes he himself made such letters to make a surprise.                           The  Capuchin  Fathers of Giardini did not succeed to  cover the roof of their                     new church dedicated to Our Lady of Pompei,  in the land of Villa Agonia.  As                     the Father happened to pass by,  he knew the situation and told Father Anthony                     of Patti,  \"I will pay everything,  but keep absolute silence!\"  Father Anthony of                     Patti broke  the silence after the Father's death,  and  stated,  \"Your padre was a                     saint, and a lover of the Madonna.\"                                                                                                               499                          Also    the  Redemptorist  Fathers  found  themselves  in    troubles  when    they                     founded  a  house  in  Francavilla,    and  had    to    restore  their  church.    Writes                     Salvatore  Di Coste,  the superior, \"I was worried  because  I needed a lot of                     money.  But Canon Di  Francia exhorted me to have trust in divine providence,                     never fearing to start  the work.  Much to my comfort,  he said that he would                     send his  little help for this work of God and Saint  Alphonsus.  Even though he                     himself had to face so many needs of his      institutions, he  sent me a thousand                     liras a month for ten months.  And to say, he called it a little help\" (Bulletin,                     February l947).                           Don  Joseph  Rossi  of  Trani,  founder  of  the  \"Abandoned Childhood,\"  said                     that he once received a big sum of money  from the Servant of God. He wanted                     to make amends for the Daughters of Divine Zeal's coldness.  Don Joseph did not                     go to their house for some months, and did not receive the usual alms.                           Besides  giving  alms,    the  Father  used  to  encourage.    After  a  visit  to  Don                     Joseph  Rossi's  institute,  he  wrote  to  him,  \"I  assure  you  that  I  was  well                     impressed... I know by experience how hard it is  starting such institutions,  and                     therefore I admire what  you conceive and do with patient concern to foster the                     orphanage.","May the  adorable Heart of Jesus,  to whom you have  consecrated  the children,                     assist,   give  credit,  and  foster  the  undertaken institution!\" (S.C.  Vol. 5, page                     294). He enforced his saying by enclosing a good sum of money.                           It  is sure that the Servant of God gave  financial help  to Don Orione.  In fact,                     the  Father  wrote  a  card  to  him  on  November  27,    l9ll:    \"I  am  ready  for  the                     money;  let me know when I can go over  to hand it to you\" (Vol.  37,  page 3).                     The amount of  the money  is unknown,  but we read that Don Orione bought the                     house for the novitiate at Bandito,  near Bra',  province of Cuneo,  on December                     8,  l9ll.  The author of Don Sterpi's life points  out, \"The  holy friendship between                     Don Orione and the Servant  of      God Canon  Hannibal  Di Francia helped buy                     the quiet dwelling of  the Counts Moffas,  near the native city of Saint Joseph                     Cottolengo\" (Don Charles  Sterpi, page 337). The Father was also ready for an                     additional  offering.  He  writes to Don Orione on  September  2, l9l5: \"Does                     Your Reverence remember the opportunity I had to help you for Bandito,  in the                     land of Moffa?  By divine mercy, today I am in the condition to do more,  just in                     case Your Reverence  were in need...\" (S.C.  Vol. 7, page l3l). The Father also                     gave another kind of help to Don Orione.  He wrote, \"I am sending to you about                     2,000  printed addresses of our devotees.  I will have  additional  ones  copied                     from the registers,  being very glad to  help   your holy institutions this way\"                     (Vol. 37, page l).                                                                                                               500                          Talking    about    female    communities  in  the  letter    to    Msgr.  Parrillo,  the                     Father writes, \"Should I say it? I will tell  you in strict confidence:  about ten                     years ago,  I gave l20,000 liras to the  declined  monastery of Morning  Star,  in                     Naples.  We  give monthly  donations  of several thousand liras to  almost all  the                     monasteries  of  the  Salesians  of  Saint  Francis  of  Sales  in    Italy,  and    some  in                     France.    The  Salesians  of  Bologna  were  given    30,000  liras    because  of  their                     strict needs.  Clare,  Dominican sisters, and  other ones are helped every month                     because of the  bad  times the nuns are running into;  they are the victims of the                     century!\" (Vol. 29, page 47).                           Before continuing on this subject,  I deem to point out  the Father's zeal for                     the sanctification of the consecrated souls and how  he was concerned with the                     religious observance and fervor in the communities he was helping.  He writes,                     \"Please let  me  know whether  the   common life and the perfect rule of Saint                     Clare  is observed  in  this monastery (the underlining is by  the  Father)","(Vol.  38,  page  27).  \"I  heartily  wish  the  Salesians  to  become  holy  in  order  to                     please at the utmost the most holy Heart of Jesus, to counterbalance those who                     do not love him,  and to win many souls\" (Vol.  38,  page  25).  On  one occasion                     he points out  that  the slackening had affected some of the sisters,  and for this                     reason  the  Lord  had  hit  the  whole  community!  They  ought  to  have  expelled                     them!  It is of importance to restore perfect discipline for  the sanctification of all                     the members.  You should have an  energetic government to restore the strength                     of perfect observance, because some  sisters abuse the kindness and the age of                     the elders\" (Vol. 39,  pages  48-50).  And elsewhere,   \" Lack of serious and  well                     ruled  discipline  has  been the cause  of  various  slackening. Discipline is so                     important in the religious institutes that  lack of it impairs their spirit\" (Vol. 39,                     page 36).                           Let  us  take  up the subject of the Father's  help  to  the monasteries.                           While  visiting  the Clare Sisters of Altamura,  the  Father knew that they had                     to repair the monastery's roof.  Back home, he sends  a card to the abbess,  \"I                     offer a thousand liras  for  the work on the roof.  The  mother superior of the                     Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  has  decided  to  offer  fifty  liras  a  month  for  your                     monastery\" (Vol. 38, page 27).                                                                                                               501                          Canon    Termine  of  Trani,    confessor  of  the  Clare  Sisters    of  the    city,                     submitted    the  urgent  need  of  that  community    to    the  Servant    of  God  and                     received  immediately  what  the  Servant  of    God  had  in  his  pocket:    500  liras.                     Around l9l0-l2, the Father gave a donation of 50,000 liras to make reparations to                     an institute.  It seems  to be the Geltrudine's of Naples that the Father had known                     around that time.                           At Ceglie Messapica (Brindisi),  the venerable Mother  Lalia had  founded a                     house of Dominican Tertiaries,  where she lived in exile until her death.  The                     Father was her spiritual director for some time, and a benefactor of that house.                           One  of  those  sisters  writes,    \"The  Servant  of  God  aided    the  religious                     communities  and  congregations  as  he  would  have  done  for  his  own.    His  aid                     never failed us. He gave the money to build the kitchen  and  to tile the hall of                     our   institute's    entrance.    He  would    have  also  given  his  help  to  open  an                     orphanage in our town, if  we had decided so.  In l9l7 he preached  the retreat  to                     our  community  in  Ceglie  Messapica,    and  commented  on  our    rules,    the                     constitutions,  and  the religious vows.  His simple,  plain word shook the souls.                     For  instance,  a  pious  mother  who  was  allowed  to  have  the  food  of  her  rich                     parents,  left out everything, wore the cilice, and did additional penances.","His  help to the Lalia's institution was not  restricted  to the  house  of                     Ceglie.    I  read  in  the  Father's    notes:    \"Palermo,  Dominicans;    Ceglie,                     Dominicans;    Rome,  Saint  Sixtus  Dominicans;  Rome,    Saint  Catherine                     Dominicans;  Rome, Saint Dominic and Saint Sixtus Dominicans\" (S.C. Vol. l0,                     page 77).                          The  Father's relations with the Capuchin Sisters of  Citta' di Castello date                     back to his youth.  It is due to his devotion to Saint  Veronica  Giuliani,  who                     lived,  died,  and  her  body  is venerated   there.  From the letters of Abbess                     Teresa we know that the  Father sent alms since then;  and he continued doing so                     his life long.  The sisters appealed to him for so many little things that  the Father                     tried to meet.  From Trani he writes  to  Mother Nazzarena, in Messina, \"The                     abbess of Citta' di Castello received the  veil for Saint Veronica.   She would like                     to have some  pale green and some white paint.  If you have some, please send it;                     if  you don't have any,  let me know so that I will find it in Naples or Rome.                     Where you buy them?\" (Vol.  35,  page 225).  A few days later he writes that he                     has already seen to it (Ibid. page 227).                          \"From  another monastery  they write to  me with ink  so  pale that  I  can                     hardly  read.\"  The Father  is  thinking  of  those sisters' poverty,  and he answers,                     'I take the liberty of sending ten liras for a bottle of good ink\" (Vol. 39, page 45).                          Several monasteries generously  prompted themselves to admit the  Father's                     institution to share in the merits of  their  good works.  Thus, they stimulated the      502                     Father to increase his help for the  material  needs of those communities.  \"When                     a  few  sisters  proposed to beg on behalf of the Visitation Sisters,  who were in                     poor conditions,  as the Father had said, he heartily agreed upon their  proposal.                     He  was  so generous toward  those  spouses  of Christ!\"  Several monasteries'                     letters echo his charity. We quote two of them.                          The  superior of the Sisters of the Visitation from  Salaria Street  in  Rome                     wrote:                           \"He  made our communities in Rome as well as others in Italy and abroad                     share in the providence that the Lord gave him; he has been a blessing for us and                     others and one of the most illustrious of our benefactors.\"                          From Pescia,  the superior of the Visitation wrote:                          \"We  too have met his boundless  charity;  indeed,  he  sent money  often  and                     whenever we appealed to him for  whatever  our","needs,  he  never denied help\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di  Francia, page 352).                           The  Visitation  Sisters of Rome have pointed  out  detailed reminiscences.                     We report them.                           \"When the Servant of God came to Rome and passed by, we felt as though                     Saint Francis of Sales were coming to visit us. Many of the  sisters  asked to have                     a private talk  for  advice,  and  we agreed  upon  their  request because all of                     them  found  comfort, fervor,  and incitement to achieve perfection.  He was so                     humble and recollected that he appeared raptured in God.  When our  late pious                     chaplain saw him celebrating mass,  he was rapt in  wonder for  his  devotion                     and  recollection,   seeing  in  that  priest  something supernatural.\" (He never                     saw him before).                           The  superior  general  of  the  Bocconiste  writes  to  the  Father:            \"We    are                     never satisfied by expressing the fulness  of  our gratitude to the excess of your                     exquisite,  noble charity  toward Daughters of  James...  For this reason , we dare                     ask you to give us a picture of you,  so that we may hang it on the wall and look                     at  the  venerable  image of our  venerable  founder's  worthiest friend.\"(2)                           The  Father  could  not help neglecting the  monasteries  in Messina.  They                     were so many before the earthquake that one of the streets  was  named  \"Street           503                     of  the    monasteries\"    (today's    XXIV  Maggio).    The    Father  gave  the  holy                     secluded the comfort  of  his charity.  Joseph  Bonarrigo who acted as a treasurer                     at  Avignone remembers,  \"One day the Father told me to buy and to unload five                     quintals  of beans at Saint Teresa monastery.  It was at  today's Saint  Dominic                     Savio's    place.\"  It  was  done  in    l894,    when    our  institute  was  in  financial                     troubles.   But this was the  Father's secret:  the  less  he owed,  the more he gave                     alms to  draw  the divine providence upon his institutions.                          We  have  already  talked of the Father's  devotion  to  the Blessed Eustochio.                     Could  he  neglect  her  daughters?    He  was  their  great    benefactor.      A    sister                     recalls,   \"I  know  by  personal experience that besides the monthly check,  he                     gave the dinner to the  sisters  of Montevergine,  and so he did with  the  Salesian                     Fathers  of  Taormina,  who  took  care  of  our  chapel.\"  When  he  was  in  need  of                     special  enlightenment  from  heaven,    the  Father  remembered  them  even  from                     afar.  He writes to  Vitale from Trani, \"I enclose 250 liras;  please give a hundred                     liras to the Little Sisters,  a hundred liras to Montevergine,  and fifty liras to the                     Salesians of Taormina\" (Vol. 33, page 65).                      When the superiors succeeded to reopen Saint Clare monastery","in  Messina after toilsome negotiations,  the Father was so happy because  a new                     hearth of prayer was enkindled.  He had longed  so much for it. The nuns wrote:                           We  talked with him for about an hour,  and we felt like  we were talking to a                     saint because of his behavior and  words...  As we left,  he gave us dried figs,                     three loaves of bread and a good sum of money to take care of our initial needs...                           He  did not stop being charitable toward us:  he came  over, always  giving                     generous  alms  and  saying:    'If  you  need    anything,  write  to  me.'  When  a                     candidate was coming into the order, he sent money to help pay expenses while                     he continued sending vegetables, oil,  wood,  etc....  We called him our padre...                     Another time, he sent  a four pound fish with a bottle of oil...  His only aim was                     helping,  relieving  his  neighbor from pain,  and to  do  so  he sacrificed himself.                           The  fish reminds me of another episode narrated by a sister or  Brother  Mary                     Anthony.  One day,  while  entering  the  Clare monastery,  he  heard  a hawker                     selling fresh fish in the street, and the Father told the sister,  \"Please give me a                     container, for I am going to buy some fish for you.\" The sister returned with  a                     plate,    but    the  Father  said,    \"What  can  I  do  with  this  plate?    I  need  a  big                     container.\" No sooner said that done...                                                                                                               504                          Saint  Clare monastery recalls to me another gentle  episode of  the Father's                     charity.  November 9,  l923,  was the  centenary anniversary of the old abbess,                     Sister Isabel Di Giovanni, of the dukes of Precacuore. She entered the cloister as                     a boarder at the age  of  three  years and became a sister.  She  went  away  from                     Messina after the earthquake and returned at the reopening of the monastery. The                     Father praised her in his verses as \"an archive of memories  of  Messina.\"  The                     Father celebrated her  centenary  by increasing  his help to the monastery and                     with a performance  by the Daughters of Divine Zeal and orphans.                           The  Thirty Three  Monastery in Naples was in bad  conditions, and the nuns                     were starving.  Besides giving his alms,  the Father tried to draw Saint Anthony's                     bread toward that religious house.                           By  daily  experience  we know  that  Saint  Anthony  grants numerous  favors                     to the people who ask for them and  promise  to give  the bread to the orphans                     and  the  poor.    The  Father  thought,  \"Won't    the    saint    grant  his  favors  to  the                     people  through  the","prayers of the cloistered nuns?\" He printed a paper and explained the nature of                     this devotion:                           Among the people in need  of Saint Anthony's bread we find a special  class                     of persons we should not  forget:  the  cloistered nuns.  They  are  very  dear  to                     God,  but  are  victims  of  the impoverishment caused by the suppression law                     and by lack of faith and  charity.  And   yet,  while the world frolics drawing                     divine punishments,  these  scared  virgins consecrated  to  God,  these mystical                     spouses  of Jesus pray,  wail,  and  sigh  before  God, drawing divine mercies.                     Dear faithful, until now Saint Anthony of Padua  has  been  granting  his favors                     to  the  people  who  have promised the bread to the poor and the orphans;  from                     now on,  he will grant more copious favors to those who promise their help to the                     sacred virgins impoverished by the world's tyranny,  enemy of God.  The  saint                     wants you to help the spouses of our Lord  Jesus Christ!                           Then,  he  explains  how to make the promise and  names  the monastery that                     needs help.                           In    Naples    there  is  a  monastery  named  Trentatre'    upon    our  Lord  Jesus                     Christ's  years.    The  people  who  are  longing  for  graces  should    appeal    to  the                     humble,  fervent  prayers of these  pious, recollected  virgins,  promising to the                     saint to help  them.  The virgins  will pray to the saint,  and the saint will obtain     505                     from the child Jesus unexpected favors. Faithful, try and find out!                           By permission of the churches' rectors, the Father exposed a framed  letter  in                     many Neapolitan churches near the  picture  of the  saint.  The  box  for  the alms                     was    named,    \"Box    of    Saint  Anthony's  bread  for  the  impoverished  sacred                     virgins\"  (S.C.  Vol. 9, page l6l).                           The  care the Father devoted to the Daughters of the  Sacred Side was not                     restricted  to  their  spiritual  and  disciplinary  life.  Praising    the  Father's  charity,                     one of those sisters states that it should be enough hinting at what \"he did for our                     institute.  If  he  had  not  come,  perhaps  it  would  have  died.\"  Later,    the  sisters                     suffered a painful division, but our Founder continued to be as a father for all of                     them, as we'll see later. The sister continues, \"When  the Servant of God was ill-                     treated,  he continued to  take care  of  us  and of those who separated as though                     we  were  his daughters.\"  The  Father wrote:  \"I took care  of  this  adoptive                     daughter,  brought  her before the Church,   fed her soul and body the  best I                     could,  carrying and presenting her to the most  holy Heart  of  Jesus  and  Mary.                     Every  time  these  dear  daughters submitted","ted their needs to me,  I always met them...\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page  l95).  We  hardly                     find a letter to the  superiors  of  the Daughters  of  the  Sacred  Side  without                     reading  that  he  was enclosing  alms for general,  or specific needs of their                     houses. Now  we specify what Msgr.  Farina said in general terms  in  his relation                     about the Daughters of the Sacred Side of Spinazzola. To avoid the expulsion of                     the sisters from the house where they were dwelling, the Servant of God gave a                     donation of 40,000 liras.                         6. The Little Sisters of the Poor                            and the Morning Star Sisters                              The  Little  Sisters of the Poor in Messina and the  Morning Star  Sisters  in                     Naples enjoyed the Father's preference  in  his almsgiving.                           Through  the  Father's and Canon Ciccolo's good offices  the Little Sisters                     came to Messina to renew the Avignone Quarter.  On February 27,  l882,  the               506                     Father took them from the station to his home  \"in  a coach driven by two horses                     out of  respect  for  the consecrated souls.\"  They found a house near the city                     along Ringo beach,  and sheltered quite a few of the poor of Avignone. Later,                     they  moved  to    Gazzi,    and  the  burden  of  Avignone  remained  in  the  Father's                     hands.  When Father Ciccolo involved himself completely with  these  sisters,                     the  Father  remained  alone  working  in Avignone...  In l920,  near the end of                     his life,  Father  Ciccolo used  to  tell the sisters,   \"Turn to Canon Di  Francia.                     He  is responsible  for  your coming to Messina;  he should  help  you.\" Needless                     to  say,   the  Father  was  and  remained  a  generous benefactor of that institute.                           Besides  sending his usual monthly offering,  the Father had in  store  a bunch                     of envelopes with the address  of  the  Little Sisters.  Thus,  it was easy for him to                     put money inside and mail it to them.  So says Sister Beatrice, who prepared the                     envelopes.  Also    the    shoemaker  worked  for  their  institute  at    the    Father's                     expenses.","One day,  the sister in charge of the alms boxes had brought one  of them                     to the Father.  Meantime the Little Sisters came in, and the Father emptied the                     box in their hands without seeing  how much he was giving.  A relation from the                     Little Sisters says that the Father did so almost every time they called upon him.                     One day they  also found an envelope with a big sum of money;  they  felt guilty                     and returned to the Father to give it back.   \"The Father, however,  responded                     with  great kindness:  'What  is  given,  is given.\"                          When    Bishop    Paino  at  the  beginning  of  his    episcopate    was  \"eager  for                     building the house of the Little Sisters of the Poor,\" and  showed his wish for                     help.  The Father offered l50,000 liras. Says the Father in the quoted letter to                     Msgr.  Parrillo, \"Really, Msgr.  Paino  began  building the hospice.  Some  of  the                     Little Sisters  died  in  the  earthquake,   and  their  institute   was destroyed.                     They were told by the archbishop of my donation,  and came  over here to thank                     me.  They asked me how much I had given, but I didn't reveal it\" (Vol. 29, page                     47).                          This report also mentions the meeting of the Father with the Little Sisters of                     Andria, who received \"a generous offering.\"                          One day,  the Father paid a visit to that institute together with  Father Vitale                     and me. We saw in the kitchen a little statue of  Saint Joseph carrying a piece of                     wood on  his  shoulders;  it meant  that  he had to provide the house with  wood.                     The    Father  smiled    and    said,    \"Please    free    Saint    Joseph    because    he    is   507                     providing   you.\"  He  ordered  a  freight  of  wood  for   their institute.\"                          As to Morning Star:                          The  Father  met  the  founder  of  that  monastery,  the  Servant  of  God    Sister                     Mary Luisa of Jesus,  on July 26,  l870,  and he  was indelibly impressed! In l922                     he writes:                           Fifty  two years ago I experienced such sacred excitement as I  stood  before                     the gate of the  Morning  Star  Monastery.  Then again,  my heart swelled when I                     was in the presence of the humble servant  of the Lord..  Not only did I see and                     talk to  her,  but also  I became the object of her sacred affection during her last                     five years of life.  She foresaw my future under the  inspiration of  the  heavenly                     bridegroom.  I enjoyed frequent  correspondence with  her,  and  her spiritual                     daughters eventually gave  me  her white veil and the candid wimple, which are                     treasures that I have cherished since she entered the kingdom of God.  Fifty years                     have passed since she died (Vol. 45, page 554).                           These    sacred    bonds  between  the  young  cleric  and    the    holy  foundress                     continued  with  the fervent nuns of  that  monastery,","especially    with  Sister  Mary  Lucy  of  the  Sacred  Heart  and    Sister  Mary                     Consiglio.  All  of them took the Father's  institution  at heart,  imploring  its                     stability  and progress  from  the  Lord. Singing  the praise of Mary Lucy in the                     funeral oration in  l907, the Father recalls the Morning Star Sisters' contribution:                           In   l880  I  was  a  newly-ordained  priest  committed   to evangelize  many                     beggars who lived assembled in a far off  corner of Messina.  Going to Naples,  I                     recommended my incipient work to these  sacred virgins' prayers,   telling them                     that  after    proper  instruction    I    would  name  the  beggars  \"The  Poor    of    the                     Sacred Heart  of  Jesus.\" Such a name touched the fibers of that  loving soul.                     Together with a few virgins she became so concerned with my incipient  work                     as  to become  the  guardian  angel,  powerfully stimulating  its formation.  It's                     more  than  27  years  since    I    am  miserably      working      in    this    institution,                     sometimes   facing difficulties  so  grave as to throw everything upside down  in                     a moment.  Sister Mary Luisa  along with her happy Sister Consiglio followed                     the events step by step,  taking a special interest  in their prayer before the Lord                     and  his  sweetest  Mother,    the  bright  Morning    Star.    How  many  times  my                     strength grew so feeble  as  to totter  and  leave out everything in the presence  of                     impossible  solutions.    But  I  had  a  harbor  of  refuge:  writing  to  Morning  Star                     Monastery.  She answered my letters with heavenly comfort, almost prophesying                     the future success. More than her letters to me, that loving soul's humble prayers                     reached heaven,  drawing the grace I was unworthy of. It supported me in my               508                     hard task.                           Sister  Mary  Luisa  shared the pains and the  joys  in  the  various vicissitudes                     of this institution. She played an essential role. So many years ago, when nothing                     was based, she wrote to me, \"The Lord Jesus will form this institution; it takes                     time.  We'll see the completing of this institution from heaven, me and others                     who were the founders\" (Vol. 45, pages l37-l38).                           The  Father never failed to recompense those fervent zealous Religious, above                     all when their institute suffered the effects of bad times.                          First,  he  returns  the prayer.  He writes  to  the  mother superior:                           Every  day  during  the  mass,    I  offer  five  intentions  for  this  institute:    l.                     Sanctification.  2. Divine providence. 3. Purchase of the Morning Star building,                     or  another  one.  4.  Another  Servant  of    God    like      Navarro  (he  had  been  the                     guardian  angel  of  the founder).  5.  A  new  Servant of God","like Sister Mary   Luisa  of Jesus.  I am praying with  great fervor;   may God                     accomplish it in his endless mercy!\" (Vol.  39, page 5l). Then he heartens the                     new  mother  superior,    exhorting  her  to  take  care  of  discipline.  \"Even  though                     unworthy,    I  exhort  you  to  trust  in  the  divine  spouse,  who  made    you    the                     successor to Sister Mary Luisa;  he will give  the grace you need.  See to it that                     observance,    prayer,  silence,  the  religious    practices,      and    mutual    charity                     bloom.      Beware    of  overlooking  the  little  defects,    because  the  communities                     slacken by them. I beg your pardon, if I dare so much (Vol. 39, page 84).                           When  the  monastery  is  lacking  means,  he  gives  generous  alms,  almost                     always  enclosing money in his letters.  When he  has  no money,  he writes to                     the  house  of  Messina  to  provide  for  them.    A  sister    remembers,    \"Upon  the                     Father's  request  from    Naples,    the  superior  general,    Sister  Nazzarena,  was                     sending a thousand liras to  Morning Star Monastery by money-order.  It was the                     only money we had in the house.  Meanwhile,  a donation of a thousand  liras                     came  in through a benefactor.\" Another sister,   \"In Messina  we owned about                     30.000  liras.    The  Father  disposed  of  half  of  them  in  favor  of  Morning  Star,                     saying that he was investing at a rate of a hundred per one in a bank which never                     goes bankrupt.\"                          The worst catastrophe fell on the institute of Mary Luisa of Jesus  when  the                     Healing Society condemned the  beautiful,  roomy institute  built   by her near                     Saint  Anthony  abbot.  The  sacred virgins  were expelled,  and the house of the         509                     Lord along with the church  dedicated  to  the most holy Virgin under  the  title                     of  Morning  Star  was  knocked  down\"  (Vol.    45,    page  562).  The  sisters  were                     \"sheltered  in an uncomfortable,  small,  unsanitary  house lacking  light  and air.                     They were surrounded  by  dirty,  noisy alleys  populated by mob,  near Santa                     Lucy a  Mare,  where  great shouting   deafened  and  distracted  them  from                     meditation  and prayer!\" (Ibid. page 564). In short time, eight sisters died.                          The sad condition worried the Father. He wrote to the mother superior,  \"I                     cannot  express  how  much  grieved  I  am  for  the  health  of    the  nuns,    whom  I                     consider as daughters and sisters  in Jesus Christ.  If the sick need a change of                     air,  my institutes are  at your  disposal\" (Vol.  39,  page 30).  \"I hope to hear                     good   news about the sick sisters.   Meantime, if  you need something, tell  me                     plainly.  See to it that they have soup, milk, eggs, etc.\" (Ibid. page 32).                          The  superior  accepted  the invitation,  and  some  of  the sisters went to                     Taormina,  Altamura,  and Trani to change air and to rest. They returned to their                     community relieved.                          But  it  was  necessary  to  move  the  community  from  the","unhealthy  place,    and  the  Father  endeavored  to  succeed  in  it.    He  sought  to                     mobilize  the  Neapolitan  Catholics.  In  December  l922,  he  had    a    speech  to  a                     Catholic women society headed by  duchess  of Airola.  Lecturing  about  the                     Servant of God Sister Mary  Luisa, glory of Naples,  \"a new Saint Teresa,  a true                     Saint Gertrude  of our  days,\"  he awoke the Neapolitans' interest in  giving  their                     support for the building of Morning Star Monastery and church. As we  have said                     above,    he  contributed  with  l20,000  liras.    He  also  printed    and  prefaced  the                     commentary of Sister Mary Luisa on  the Song of Songs, leaving the proceeds to                     the monastery.                           To  develop an institution,  however,  the building  is  not enough. He noted:                           Sister  Mary Luisa's institute came to such a lack of  means and  vocations  as                     to  reach  the  brink  of  death.  It  should correspond to the spiritual and social                     needs of the present  time (Vol.  39,  page 5).  May Jesus assure this way the                     future of the institute! Something must be done,  some resource is needed.  The                     way  you  live  cannot last,  and the institution is  in  danger. Cloistered nuns may                     have alms today,  tomorrow may not.  When the Lord calls me to eternity,  none                     knows whether my successors will help you the way I do.  The Lord needs not                     me,  nor anyone  else, but  he wants us to use our means and to be foreseeing.                     The Lord says, \"Help yourself, and I will help you\" (Ibid. page 6).                                                                                                               510                          To  be factual,  the Father suggested the foundation  of  an orphanage:                           In your rules, you have the seed of the orphanage, viz., the education  of  the                     poor    girls.    It's  not  a  long    way    from    the  education  of  poor  girls  to  an                     orphanage.    If  the  institute    steps  forth    a    little    bit    for  the  education    and                     salvation  of  the abandoned girls,  it does not go beyond,  nor does it change  the                     nature of your mission;  rather,  improves it\" (Vol. 39, page 5). The  orphanage                     will  draw  upon  you  the  blessings  of  God  and    men.  The    youth    of    this                     institution  must  move,  being  energetic, otherwise everything comes to nothing                     (Ibid. page 55).                           However  it turns out,  he assures his prayers to this  end, wants  the sisters to                     pray much in order to know the will of God, and  suggests specific prayers and                     novenas.    Then    he    concludes,  \"Let    us  pray  and  let  me  know\"  (Ibid.).    The                     Morning Star Sisters came into activity spreading the circle of their apostolate,                     and the sweetest Virgin, Morning Star, blessed and developed them.","7. Hospitality                              The    Father  prescribes,    \"A  form  of  charity  we  must  have    at  heart,                     performing   it  with  kindness  and  sacred  care,   is hospitality.  If the guests                     are  poor,    we  will  provide  them  with  everything  without  charging.  Let  us                     remember Saint Paul's saying:   \"Because  of hospitality Abraham deserved                     lodging  the  angels\" (Heb. l3, 2).     \"Each house will have the guest rooms                     separated from the institute so that the guests may have no relations  with the                     community.  Some  brother or priest will take care of  them\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page                     ll3).                           This is very fine when a suitable,  roomy institute has such facilities,  but  the                     Avignone Quarter could hardly  shelter  its people.  And  yet,  hospitality  should                     not be denied  under  the pretext  of lacking room.  For this reason,  in the late                     evening  people    had  to  set  up  everything  for  the  guest  in  a  class,    or  in  the                     laboratory,  or in the porter's lodge,  and remove everything in the morning.                          One evening,  after preparing a few make-shift beds,  a  new guest came in,                     late in the night,  and I had also to provide for him.  My  attitude  betrayed my                     inner discomfort,  as if  I  were thinking  of sending the guest elsewhere for lack       511                     of room.  Aware of that,  the Father told me,  \"If we don't suffer inconvenience,                     what is our charity worthy of? If we had suitable facilities, how little deserving                     our charity would be...\"                           In  the last years of the Father,  one evening I was  really compelled to deny                     hospitality for absolute lack of room. When the Father heard of it,  he became                     sorry and told me, \"You could have lodged  him in my room.\" From then on,  the                     Father's room was  at disposal of the guests, since he remained at the Holy Spirit.                          Drago  remembers:  \"A friar came to Oria late in  the  night saying  that  he                     was the procurator general of his order,  but  I remained very doubtful.  After                     giving him a dinner, I sent him to an  inn at my expenses.  When I informed the                     Servant of  God,  he reproached me.  At my defense, I ventured the doubt that he                     could be a thief, but the Father smiling said, 'What could he rob'?\"                          In    l892  the  Father  gave  hospitality  in  Messina  to  a    priest  seeming    not                     entirely in good standing.  When he wrote  thanking, the Father responded,                           I gave you hospitality by duty, because the Lord wants us to do so;  please                     forgive me if I was unable to do better; we are in poverty. I know","from  your  letter  that  you  will  go  to  Africa.  But,  my    goodness,    how    many                     things  people  say    of    you.    The    whole  information  agrees  that  you  are  a                     missionary,  as well as you are out of your order.  My dear friend,  I do not know                     what to  think of:  it  must be some mystery.  Your perfect lay  behavior,  your                     leaving  out  the  canonical hours on the ground  of  unjustified reasons,  and  so                     many  circumstances  arouse  suspicion    upon    you.  Meanwhile  I  esteem  you                     heartily.  My dearest friend, just in case you  were out of your order,  I exhort                     you  to  return  to  your  holy  religion.    My  brother,    consider  that  our  faithful                     service  to  God  is    our    real    interest    in  this  life  to    win    the    eternal    one!                     Everything  comes  to  an  end!  Eternity  is  coming.  Let  us  save  souls  and                     ourselves! Why don't you tell me the mission you  are  going to?  Everything is                     mystery! Everywhere you go,  do not forget us, your  memory  is very dear to us.                     Saint Joseph has accepted  the Chinese prayer and a benefactor will buy part of                     the building for us.  Please write to us.  Just in case you come to Messina, these                     little  houses are always open  to you.  Be  fervent,  observant, humble,   detached                     from    everything,      obedient,      sincere,    in  charitate  non  ficta,    cum  omni                     humilitate et patientia (Vol.  37, page 2l).                           After  the l908 earthquake,  the Servant of God received  in the  institute of                     Messina the venerable Priest  Francis  Jannello who  was blind since many years.                     In his  youth he had founded  The Catholic   Sicily,  a newspaper that caused a           512                     ruffian    to    attempt  upon    his    life.    He    had  been  the  vice-director  of    the                     Messina seminary  for several years.  The Father writes,  \"He  wished  to retire                     in our institute and  we felt honored and  happy,  giving him  our  filial cares and                     accurate services.\" How  delicate  the Father was to him,  to whom he often went                     for  confession;    how  he  watched  over  so  that  nothing  failed  to  him,  and  how                     many times he submitted   to  our  consideration  his  heroic  patience  as  an                     example.\" Eventually he died on February ll, l9l9, and the Father remembered his                     memory on God and Neighbor of the following  month with kind words (S.C.                     Vol. l, page 209).                          Let  us  glean from various relations:  \"The Father   had  a veneration  for                     hospitality.  Since Avignone Quarter was  lacking facilities, he did his best so                     that  the  frequent,  and  even  famous  guests    have    an  easy  lodging,    warmly                     exhorting us  to  continue doing  so.\"  \"He held hospitality as sacred:  not only we                     had  to give hospitality,  but we had also to meet beforehand the guest's needs                     and wishes.\" Says a sister,  \"He helped the missionaries in any  way,  also  by                     giving hospitality.  Now  and  then,  I  was entrusted by the Father with giving                     the most generous and  gentle hospitality  in  Trani.\"  \"He often and seriously                     admonished  us never  to  deny","hospitality  to  priests  or    laymen.\"    The    Father  watched    over    so    that                     everything  be  done  \"with  well-chosen courtesy  and care.\" A sister recalls,                     \"The servant of  God  had ordered  the dinner for two persons.  Because I knew                     their social status,  I set the table in a common way; but, the Father told me to                     clear the table and to set it in the best  way,  saying,  \"We must  deal so with the                     guests,  independently from  their  social status.\"                           \"The  Servant  of  God took information about  their  needs, diet,  when they                     liked dinner,  or anything else and used to tell us:  'To give hospitality is not                     enough; we have to do it exactly right in order to avoid trouble and awkwardness                     for the  guests.' He said about himself:  'Once I was invited to lunch, but by 2:00                     p.m.  no one had thought of eating;  I was unable to endure it. I lacked simplicity.                     I should have said: -excuse me, I am not used to  this  lunch time;  please give me                     something because I am  not feeling well-   therefore, we must meet the needs of                     our guests'\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, pages 350-35l).                           At  the  beginning  of  the  foundation,  the  sisters  gave hospitality  to two                     Religious,  and on that occasion  the    Father seized  the  opportunity  to exhort                     his  daughters.  \"I  am  very pleased  that  two  daughters of Saint Francis dwell                     among  you. Treat them the best you can and learn how they are devoted to the                     service  of  Jesus in their order.  Giving hospitality  to  these daughters  is a grace                     from the child Jesus.  This is  the  second religious  community that lodges in the       513                     hovels of the Little Poor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. We have this great honor!                     Let us be grateful  to  the Lord,  because these good  sisters  have  begun loving                     our institution and are praying for its improvement.\"                           Blessed  daughters,  you see how many small trees are rising in the Church of                     our Lord; they take different shapes, but all of them are beautiful.  They  give                     new  fruits  for  Jesus  and  souls...  Who    knows  whether  divine  mercy  wants  to                     bless  this  seed,  this little grain,  making it grow in the holy Church's garden!                     Due to my sins and defects, I am unworthy of so much; you, however, pray the                     Lord to continue giving you the means of sanctification that he has granted until                     now.                          If you zealously practice holy virtues, especially the daily little ones;  if you                     love your rule,  your name, and your emblem, we  have ground to hope that the                     little seed will fructify  (Vol. 34, page 75).                           A  sister reports:  \"Two sisters of another congregation had missed  the last                     train in the evening and knocked at our door  at l0:30 in the night.  The Father                     gave them hospitality and  called upon  me  to have the sister cook and the linen                     sister got up  to","prepare the dinner and the room.  The next day,  he also provided them with the                     breakfast for the travel.\"                           The French Religious  Bovin was expelled by the  suppression law  before                     the l908 earthquake;  the Father lodged him for  two years.                           Every  time  I read in the canonical hours  Saint  Gregory's saying, \"We have                     to  invite  and  to  urge  the  pilgrims  to  accept  our  hospitality\"  (Easter  Monday,                     reading 3),  my thoughts fly to the Father.                           If a priest happened to come over,  the Father entreated him to lodge,  and he                     himself  often  prepared  the  room.  Writes    Father  Vitale:  \"One  evening  while                     returning home, he saw a priest on the ferry and said to himself::  where is he                     going  to  sleep  now  after  the  earthquake?  He  invited  the  priest  back  to  our                     institute. That night we heard a knocking at our door: 'Quick, get up, we have to                     prepare lodgings for a guest'\" (Ibid. page 35l).                           Three  Capuchins came to Oria in a late  winter  night,  and Brother Joseph                     Anthony  Meli  heard  them  saying  at  the  station  that  they  were  going  to  the                     seminary for lodgings.  The Servant of God reproached  the  brother because he                     had not invited them  to  our institute.  Despite  the night and the rain,  the Father                     sent the brother with the lantern to search for them. They were before the closed         514                     door  of  the  seminary,   and  accepted  the   brother's invitation. The Servant of                     God apologized, prepared warm water to wash  their  feet himself,  and searched                     for  blankets,  perhaps picking up some of his.  \"By day and by night, for so                     many years, we  received  guests.  He himself often asked some passengers  if                     they had lodgings,  and in case of need,  he offered his  houses, despite  they                     were  small and poor...  Some time  he  also  took bishops.  At our remarking that                     it was improper for their dignity he responded that his poverty excused him from                     everything.\"                           Once,  I was with the Father in Naples,  and we did not find hospitality at                     several religious communities of the city (in that time  the  clergy house did not                     exist).  We went to the  Father's relatives'.  He told me, \"See, my son, how much                     we suffer to find hospitality; it must foster our institute's spirit of hospitality in                     us.\"  After  recalling Abraham's giving  hospitality  to  the angels,   he  continued,                     \"To  express  his  pleasure  for   the institute's  spirit,  the Lord gave us the honor                     to lodge in  the poor   Avignone  houses  two  bishops,   the  successors  to  the                     apostles.\"  I  remember  them:","Msgr.  Nicholas   Mary  Dobrecic, Archbishop  of Antivari,  primate of the then                     Serbia,  and  Msgr. Eugenio  Giambro,  Bishop of Nicastro.  Oh,  how  solicitous                     the Father  was so that nothing was lacking! He himself prepared  the rooms,                     and because the bishop of Nicastro was tall, to avoid any discomfort  the  Father                     prolonged  the matress  by  placing  two cushions  at the end of it.                       Notes                             (l)   Mother   Anthony  Lalia  (l839-l9l4)   from   Misilmeri (Palermo),  the  founder                     of  Dominican Sisters  of  Saint  Sisto Vecchio in Rome,  had a great soul in a small                     body undermined  by penance  and  infirmities.  After governing her institute for  l7                     years, the congregants put her aside. In the plan of God, she had to  make  fruitful  the                     institution  with  her  immolation.  \"How excellent is Mother Lalia in that hour! She                     must  disappear,  her congregation,  not,  because  it is a work of God,  the result of                     tears  and  heroic  deeds.    Her  spiritual  directors,  such  as    Father  Lombardo,    Lepidi,                     Canon Di Francia supported her in founding the congregation of Saint Sisto Vecchio.                     They kept  near her in  the hour  of darkness,  in the hour of her  suffering to present                     that  purest  host  to  God.    Deposed  from  the  general's  office,    she  goes  into  exile,                     blessing and kissing the hands hitting her. A mother is always mistaken,  and she must                     pay dearly,  suffer, and die to save her children,  as Jesus did!\" ( Taurisano, preface to   515                     Mother Anthony Lalia by Sister M. G. Arena, O.P.).                          Writing to the Father on March 7,  l9l3,  she exclaims,  \"My sweet  exile,  my dear                     prison,  my delightful paradise! Jesus  is alone in this sacred tabernacle,  and I am alone                     in this  beloved cell.  He  forms,  and is my paradise.  I hope to pass from  this paradise                     of  holy  resignation to eternal rest.\"  She  died  the following year on April 9, l9l4.                     Twenty five years later, when so many prejudices disappeared and several events were                     cleared,  her congregation  acknowledged her as a great founder,  and took  her remains                     at the mother-house.  On July 22,  l939, her remains were buried in the chapter  hall of                     Saint Sisto Vecchio,  which is the cradle   of   the  Dominican  order  and  a  witness   of                     three resurrections  from  the  dead  by  Saint  Dominic.   The  recent biography  by                     Timothy  Centi  O.P.  (Madre  M.  Antonia  Lalia, fondatrice delle Suore Domenicane                     di S.  Sisto  Vecchio- Edizioni S.  Sisto  Vecchio,  Rome,  l972)  lays emphasis on the                     Father's spiritual direction to Mother Lalia.                           (2)  The  Servant  of God  James  Cusmano  (l834-l888)  from Palermo was a doctor                     who became a diocesan priest.  He stands out in  the  nineteenth  century as a great                     apostle  of  charity.  He founded The Servants of the Poor and The Sisters Servants of                     the Poor,  known  better  as Bocconisti and  Bocconiste.  Such  names originated  from                     a use in a friend's  house,  where  each  table companions  reserved  a  mouthful for the                     poor,  with  joy  and edification.

Notes","1. Progressing gladly in the way of charity                              \"Different religious  families have come  into existence   in  which  spiritual                     resources are multiplied for  the  progress  in holiness  of their members and for                     the good of the entire body of Christ...  Thus they are enabled to live securely                     and to maintain faithfully  the  religious  life  to  which  they  have   pledged                     themselves. Rejoicing in spirit they advance on the road of love\"  (L.G. 43 ).                          Let  us  listen again to the Father on this subject.                           As  a miserable and unworthy director,  I beseech myself and my brothers in                     Jesus  Christ  to  make  mutual  charity  reign  in    this  institute;  the  tender,  true,                     Christian, holy, pure charity, which makes  no distinction between the persons.                     May it be in God  and for  God like the charity of our models Jesus and Mary;                     may  this  charity    pervade    our  actions  and  form  the  spirit  of    this    least                     congregation in its existence.                          Our dealing with our neighbor will be ruled by the apostle's divine  saying,                     \"Now I will show you the way which surpasses all the  others.  If I speak with                     human tongues and angelic as  well, but do not have love,  I am a noisy gong, a                     clanging  cymbal.  If  I  have  the  gift  of  prophecy  and,    with  full    knowledge,                     comprehend all  mysteries,  if I have faith great enough to move  mountains, but          518                     have not love,  I am nothing.  If I give everything I have to feed the poor,  and                     hand over my body to be burned,  but have not love, I gain nothing.                          Love is patient;  love is kind. Love is not jealous, it does not put on airs,  it is                     not snobbish.  Love is never rude,  it is not self-seeking, it is not prone to anger;                     neither does it brood over  injuries.  Love  does  not  rejoice in what  is  wrong                     but rejoices with the truth. There is no limit to love's forbearance, to its trust, its                     hope, its power to endure.                          Love  never fails.  Prophecies will cease,  tongues will  be silent, knowledge                     will pass away\" (l Cor. l3, l-8).                          What  a deep meaning these divine words contain! They are  a great rule for                     those who want to imitate the most holy charity of our divine","model, Jesus Christ . Charity drew him to the altar of the cross.                           For the congregants of the Rogation of Jesus' Heart, charity will  be the soul                     and the study of their  perfection.  They  will seek  the spiritual and temporal                     good of others as their own,  at least affectively.                           Everyone  will beware of failing in the charity  toward  the brethren.  This                     virtue is so excellent that we should always ask for  it  from the Hearts of Jesus                     and  Mary.  It  helps  us,  our institute,  the  orphans  we are educating,  the poor                     of  Jesus' Heart, and also the holy Church (S.C. Vol. l0, pages l95-l96).                        2. Charity with us and the others                              \"Over all these virtues put on love, which binds the rest together  and  makes                     them perfect\" (Col.  3,  l4).  Read how  the Father applied this teaching of the                     apostle to the community.                          \"Behaving  charitably and conveniently with the persons  who live  with  us          519                     is    the  touch-stone  of  virtue    and    good    nature.  Behaving    cements  the                     community,  which subsists in the  members' mutual union of charity\" (S.C.  Vol.                     l0, page l73). To be factual he suggests,                           I will try to form a tender,  affectionate, loving heart for the members of the                     institute, asking the most holy Heart of Jesus to  grant me the spirit of charity                     toward my brethren in order to love,  sympathize, wish, and procure their good as                     much as I can, as if it were mine.                          Bewaring  of  nurturing aversion or grudge  against  anyone, still less against                     those who seem contrary or offensive to me,  I promise the following:                          l. I will not be prone to believe that I have been offended, I will think instead                     that  my  imagination  and  selfishness    amplify  the    things  making  them  appear                     grim to me.                          2.   If  someone  really  offends  me,  I  will  not  become indignant,   but  I                     will  sympathize,  love,  and  look  on  him  favorably,  recommending  him to                     the Lord in order to return good for evil (Vol. 44, page l20).                           Charity, however, cannot be confined to the circle of one's own community,                     as the priest and Levite of the gospel's parable","meant.   Charity  is open to all the children of God.  The Father tells  us:                           \"We must use charity, respect, and fine manners among us, as well as with                     everyone  also  for  giving  good  example.    If  we  do  not  edify  the  people  with                     honest,  charitable manners,  holy garb and institution  will be discredited by our                     dealing harshly,  or  our offending people with words and deeds.  Sometimes we                     can deny  the pretensions  of  people with fine manners and charity.  But  it's                     better  to abound in charity and fine manners than to  be  harsh\" (S.C. Vol. l0,                     page l96).                        3. Not for expedition only                              Let   us  see  how  the  Father  practiced  charity  in  the government of his                     communities.                           The way he was named shows the nature of his charity. He was not named as                     director,  superior,  general,  founder,  nor  Father  Di  Francia;  he  was  named  the   520                     padre.  That's it.  It is true that in his  own  funeral oration he said that \"he used                     to  sign  so  for expedition\" (S.C.  Vol.  7, page 240), but his spiritual children                     did    not    mean  so,    nor  the  city  of  Messina.    They  named  him  the  padre                     antonomastically.  Lawyer  Romano  specifies,  \"In  Messina,  the  Canon  meant                     Canon  Vitale;  the  Padre,  Canon  Di  Francia\"  (Tusino,  Il  Padre  Francis                     Bonaventure  Vitale,  page  70).  Archbishop  Paino  did    the  same  in  his  speech                     before the padre's  coffin.  \"Let  me shed my tears: yes, my tears, because we all                     have lost the padre, my dear orphans.  Messina on the whole feels orphaned as I                     do.  I have felt the superiority of the heart every time he came over to say his                     words of love and faith.                           All  of  us feel orphaned,  all feel like  children  in  the presence of Canon Di                     Francia's  outstanding  fatherhood\"  (Father    Mary  Hannibal  Di  Francia,  page                     37l).                           But even though he was the padre (and we have to pay our deep respect and                     veneration to him), he wished to be like one of","us everywhere: in the church, in the refectory, in the courtyard. For  instance,  he                     practiced the confession of his own faults  in the refectory, as we did.                           As to observance,   he was demanding, but in a Fatherly way. \"I  recommend                     you to be fond of discipline,  because it  supports the  community,   and  no                     community  can  progress  without  it. Discipline means observance of the rules,                     of  the  schedule,  and  of  the  silence!  Rule,    Schedule,  Silence.  What  a                     responsibility  they  take    upon  themselves  those  daughters  who    disregard                     discipline, causing  others to do the same! From now on,  each of you may  be                     like  a  bee making honey in silence!\" (Vol.  34,  page  75).  He points  out,  \"The                     observance  and  virtue  of  the    individual    also  belong  to  the  Church,    to                     humankind!  Therefore,    any  inobservance  and    lack  of  virtue  is  a  cheating  of                     which we'll give an  account to the Lord!...\" (S.  C.  Vol.l0, page 72). He writes                     to a mother superior during the first world war.  \"Insist upon observance  on my                     behalf,  in such tremendous times! We must avoid provoking our Lord! Instead,                     we  must  be  fervent  in  the  love  of  Jesus  and  Mary,  competing    in  humility,                     obedience,  silence,  sacrifice,  humble works, charity, and mutual respect, also                     paying careful attention to  prayer,   from  which  any  sanctification  depends.                     Persons  lukewarm    and    inattentive    to    holy    prayer    will    never    become                     holy!...(S.C.  Vol. 5, page 24). \"Blessed daughters, I exhort you to renew your                     spirit,    rising  from  faults,    humbling    yourselves,  and  continuing  your        521                     improvement in the holy virtues without fear. Do  not  fail in the practice of the                     little,  daily  virtues  and mortifications, because some little virtues are worthier                     in God's eyes  than  some  sublime ones! Likewise,  beware of  the  little defects,                     whose  frequency  impedes union with  God.  'Catch  the foxes,  the little foxes                     that damage the vineyards' (Song 2, l5); viz., root out the little passions, malices,                     and bad inclinations that damage the vineyard of the spirit\" (Vol. 34, page l).                           However  self-controlled  he was,  the Father  worried  when people did not                     correspond to grace.  He was exceptional.  When he realized a little fault in us,                     he made us understand its gravity, and even reproached us.  But,  shortly after,                     he became calm. As soon  as  he  saw a sign of repentance,  he joyfully  reduced                     or  eliminated  the  punishment  .    \"He  admonished  like  a  Father,  making  us                     understand the evil of the faults and the offense to God.\"","4. Charity is also made of prayer...                              To  prevent  lack of charity among his children  and  to  avoid  slackening  in                     the spiritual life,  the Father  calls  the superiors' attention:                           Decrease of holy, mutual love is a most fateful door of general decline!  The                     superior will be very attentive  in  this matter.  First, he  will love his subjects                     much, much, much  with tender holy affection,  showing it by facts (Vol.  l, page                     l35).                           Both  superiors  and  subjects must  be  very  attentive  to dispatch  occasions                     and any kind of slackening in the  observance of the holy virtues. For this reason                     no outsider will be admitted in our community.  By loving one another with pure,                     tender, holy love  we must form one heart and one soul.  Therefore,  we'll  be                     very    sorry  for  the  slackening  of  any  of  us,    being  eager  for  his  spiritual                     recovery,  and glad for his spiritual good  (Vol.  40, page l4l).                           We  show  first  our charity by praying  sincerely  for  one another,  especially                     when  someone  is in danger of  losing  his virtue  or his vocation.  The Religious                     who cries before  God  to obtain   grace  for  the  tottering  brother  will  become      522                     most acceptable,   whereas   the  community's  indifference  before  a tottering                     vocation  is  very pitiable!   In such a case, the superior may tell the community                     to pray for an intention, without specifying it (Vol. l, page l36).                           And  how  much  the  Father  prayed  for  his  children!  Besides  the  general                     intentions  in  his prayers and the  intentions  in  the prayers of the institute,  he                     wrote numerous prayers for specific persons.                           For  instance,  he  remembers the persons who lived  in  the institute:  \"the                     kindergarten  children,  the  little  old  women,  the  clerics,  the  tailors,  the                     shoemakers,  and    everyone  who  shared  in  it.\"    He  asks,    \"O  Jesus,    Good                     Shepherd,  I beseech you to bless them.  Save children from corruption, lead the                     older to the haven of  salvation,  and sinners to penance.  Very compassionate                     Lord,","see  to    it    that  all  of  us  see  again  each    other    in    paradise!\"  Specifically:                     \"Immaculate Mary,  I entreat  you particularly  for that  son  L...  (We do not                     know who he is).  Put him under  your motherly protection and save him!\" (S.C.                     Vol. l0, page 26).                           A  petition to the eternal Father for the merits of the most holy  Name  of                     Jesus  asks  that none  of  the  members  of  the institutions be lost: nor Religious                     nor children, nor present nor future ones.                           A long prayer \"for my daughters of the Little Retreat\"  ends with a thought                     about the future congregants. \"My Jesus, I beseech you  not  only for them,  but                     also for the future ones  who  will share the little flock, and for the redeemed                     souls\" (Vol. 6, page l42).  For  the little group of the clerics:  \"Sweetest Heart  of                     Jesus,  I entrust it to  you.  Place it in  your open wound, infuse in it the vital                     humor of your grace,  virtues,  and life; form it with your blessings, and bring it                     to perfect maturity\" (S.C. Vol. l0,  page 28). He prays for the clerics.                           Most    holy  Mother  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ,    Mother    of    the  Church,    I                     deliver and entrust them to you.  The greatest gift I can  give you is putting in                     your hands those who long  to  become the  representatives of your divine son,                     the  saviors  of  souls...  Holy  Mother,  pray,  pray,  pray,  and  work  for  their     523                     sanctification, making  them  grow in the divine union with Jesus.  O  most  holy                     Mother, I also beseech you to grant me sweetness and grace when I exhort the                     clerics  to  the  practice  of  virtue  and  discipline.  Keep  me    from  setting  bad                     examples,    even  the  slightest  one!      O    most  holy  Virgin,  I  also  pray  for  the                     bodily health of these elects in order  that they may help the Church.  O sweetest                     Mother,  infuse holy joy in their hearts,  keeping them always glad. Cause of our                     joy,  pray for us!  Holy Mother,  hear my supplication! Grant  it for the sake,  the                     honor,  and  the  glory  of  Jesus;  for  the  greater  consolation  of  his  Heart.  Amen                     (Ibid. page 29).                           On    so    many  occasions  the  Father  appealed  to  Saint    Anthony  promising                     prayers,    celebrations  of  masses,  and  giving  of  alms  to  the  poor.  His  children                     were often the object of his promises. For instance,  when each of us returned                     from  the  war,  he  celebrated  a  mass  of  thanksgiving  and  gave  thirteen  kg.    of                     bread to the poor. The  condition  of the following promise reveals the kindness                     of his charity:  \"If X gives in to holy obedience!\"  (S.C.  Vol.  9, page 303).                           Prayer  with ardent charity for our brethren  also  includes our  dead  ones.                     How  the Father remembered them! I will never forget the Father's whisper at my                     ear on the day of my priestly ordination","tion,    \"Remember    Father  Bonarrigo.\"  And  yet,    he  was    dead  since  fourteen                     years.  The April l6,  l922,  Easter Sunday,  the Father dictated to me this short                     article for our bulletin:                                                       Our dear deceased                           The  communion of saints is an article of our faith.  When a dear  deceased is                     morally  supposed  to  enjoy  the    beatific    vision  because    he    lived    and  died                     saintly,    we  resort    to    him    almost  instinctively    in    the    emergencies.      It                     happens  usually,  and sometimes  we experience sensibly the protection of ours                     who  are in heaven or in purgatory.                           Once,    I  was  searching  for  important  papers,    in  vain.  While  staying    in                     Giardini,  I thought of saying a mass for our dearest Father Bonarrigo. During the                     mass, an idea crossed my mind. 'Will he  give  me a sign of having appreciated                     the  mass?'    I    was    not  thinking    of  the  papers.    Not  at  all.    Back  home  in                     Taormina,  I wished  to put things in order in some cases when I found  myself                     having  those papers in my hands.  Father Bonarrigo's handwriting described  on                     the wrapper which papers were in.  I  was  amazed! Didn't the holy man give me                     an evident sign that he had  accepted the mass and was thankful?                          524                           As  the Church of Jesus Christ is formed by those who are in  heaven,  on                     earth,  and in purgatory, so a congregation is formed by its members who are in                     heaven,  in purgatory,  and earth. They share among themselves the treasure of                     faith.                           Sometimes  I  think  that the best  of  our  communities  is already  in  heaven.                     It  is formed  by  brothers,  sisters,  and orphans; without any distinction between                     male and female, because all  of them are like the angels of God.  The only priest                     of  our congregation  in heaven is Father Bonarrigo,  who is  waiting  to meet me                     first.                           Our  heavenly  community  shines  with  the  divine  Rogate        and  with  a                     particular beauty from the divine zeal of Jesus' Heart. It watches  over our houses                     and prays for their members,  that we be one with Jesus and Mary,  as Jesus is                     one with his Father\"  (S.C. Vol. l0, page l6l).","5. Kindness and firmness                              \"Kindness    stood    out  in  the    Father's    government,    through  which  he                     corrected faults.  For instance, he mildly reproached me for  my  natural wildness                     in talking and acting,  and delayed  my taking  of the religious garb one year.  To                     point out my  way  of talking,  he asked Mother Nazzarena, 'Sister, do you never                     give a piece  of sugar to this daughter?' One day he couldn't leave  for unknown                     reasons.  At his coming back I went to him for  comfort, and he Fatherly cheered                     up my afflicted spirit. Leaving his room, he met Father Occhiuto,  pastor of Saint                     Eufemia (Calabria),  and told  him gladly,  'It has been a blessing that I did not                     leave, because this daughter needed me'.\"                           How  he sympathized and heartened people! He once  wrote  to Father Vitale,                     who was very busy, \"I imagine you’re bustling about! May  the  Heart  of Jesus                     assist you.  Do not  tire  yourself  by writing to me, if you cannot\" (Vol. 3l, page                     7). When the effects of  the war were felt,  the Father makes witty remarks to                     Father  Vitale,  \"Is  Canon  Vitale  going  to  the  front?  No  less!  But  he  will  fight                     bravely,  arming  himself  with the hauberk of  his  great faith,  with the shield of                     divine protection,  with the sword and the helmet of prayer,  and will win\" (Vol.         525                     32,  page  92).  Soon after,  \"Machine-guns,  bayonets,  420,  weapons  and  army                     were defeated by General Vitali.  The quarter is beflagged, the enemy takes to                     flight!...\" (Vol. 32, page ll4).                           One of the first novices distinguished herself in a song  to the  Madonna,  and                     the  Father wrote,  \"Canon Hannibal  Mary  Di Francia  congratulates upon the                     Novice Affronte and  delights  in this  first  flower of sacred harmony dedicated                     to the most  holy Virgin,  for  the  Lord's glory.  May he bless you and  make                     you belong totally to him. February 28, l890\" (Vol. 34, page 6l). One day,  he                     wrote to a sister who combined musical expertise with a sweet, enchanting voice.                                Words of Jesus:                                     I gave a harmonious voice to thee'                                    It is right if you return it to me.                                Words of the soul:                                     I am nothing, but what you gave me,                                    My Jesus, I will return to thee.\"","On the occasion of a nice performance, the Father gave her a picture of Our Lady                     of Lourdes;  on the back he wrote:  \"Cheer in the  Lord and a particular blessing,                     wishing  you the harmony  of holy virtues because this is the true harmonious                     song before  the Lord. C.A.M.D.F.\" (Vol. 43, page l64).                           I tell you an incident regarding me. It is well known that I have no gift for                     poetry.  On one occasion,  however, I was unable to  decline doing some verses                     for the Father's name's day,  and I strove...  At the first occasion the Father told                     me, \"I read your verses...  pretty well; you need practice...\" On another occasion                     not  only  I dared writing verses,  but I also  resorted  to  the Father,  who  had                     the patience to read them without throwing  my scribbles into the waste paper                     basket!                           Tired  of  the  religious  discipline,    two  sisters  returned    to  the  world.    But,                     shortly after they repented and asked the Father to  receive them again...  The                     Father remarks:                           Are  you  not  yet aware that  the devil  won  you?  A  good Religious  suffers                     aversion   with patience,  and  when  she  is despised and humiliated she delights                     in it for the sake of  Jesus Christ.                                                                                                               526                          Poor Lord! He must suffer even from the souls consecrated to him! What the                     worldly persons do, is not enough!                           If you are repented and willing to return to the feet of our Lord,  I make an                     exception and open the doors of the mother-house in Messina.  Thus, you begin a                     new life, and with true repentance and  perfect behavior you clear and erase your                     inconsiderate step and the bad example you have settled.  How much evil is done                     with an example such as this! (Vol. 34, page l22).                           Lectures,   spiritual  readings,  private  talks  were  good occasions for the                     Servant of God to lead us to the Lord.  All  of us Religious and orphans, as well                     as lay people took advantage.\"                           The Father insisted,  \"Dearest daughters, I exhort you to be faithful  to the                     grace of God,  who calls you to holiness and  to Jesus\" (S.C.  Vol.  8, page l8l).                     But he was uncompromising about principles.  He  wrote,  \"The  superiors and                     the  directors  will promise to fatherly correct their subjects,  as well as to  expel                     inexorably the incorrigible pertinacious (Vol. 40, page l42).                           Writing  to  a  mother  superior  he  states,    \"The  sisters  should  know    that  I                     cannot keep for any reason the ones who do not  live","according to the rules,  but I expel them\" (S.C.  Vol.  8,  page l23). Treating                     about a sister in particular, he writes,                           Be  not moved by tenderness or by inopportune piety for  X, because  I doubt                     that this person will succeed.  Let us pray  and be vigilant,  letting  me know her                     behavior.  Please  encourage  and  treat  her  with  true  charity,  but  demand  her  to                     behave!  In  the community  we must seek the common more than the individual                     good. It  is  better to be few in number and good,  than  having  false vocations,                     which ruin the communities\" (S.C.  Vol. 8, page 20l).                           The sister was unwilling to admit her faults, and the Father was inexorable.                           Since she does not admit her faults,   it is impossible that X behave better,                     and she will not without a great miracle! Treat her charitably and prudently as                     you have done until now,  but  be firm  that  she  must  leave.                           Because  the  mother  superior was interceding  for  X,  the Father insists,                           \"Please,  to  whom  do  we have to  forgive?   To  a  person thinking  of                     having committed no fault?  You must admit that  the only remedy for her is her                     going  back  home.    It  is  better  for  her  and  for  us.  Hold  with  certainty  that  a   527                     director of a community is practicing  charity  when he/she expels   subversive                     persons;  and when he/she hesitates to do so, he/she is acting against charity\"                     (S.C. Vol. 8, page l98).                           Unfortunately,    this  case  of  expulsion  was  not  the  only  one.  The    Father                     confides to Msgr.  Razzoli to have expelled more than l50  youth in thirty years:                     \"Some of them after a few  years  of postulate,  and  a few ones after the taking                     of the garb  because they were incorrigible. Thanks to God, I have been firm to                     put an end to them\" (S.C.  Vol. 7, page l97). In doing so the Father did not  rush;                     in fact,  after deciding the expulsion of a sister he writes to a mother superior:                           Sister  X  must return home.  It is true that the  Lord  can change  her  in a                     moment,  and we pray for it.  But she shows  no sign,  nor does she admit her                     faults. She denies everything with a bad spirit,   has  no  religious  vocation,  and                     no  inclination  to obedience.  Her  stubbornness  to  remain  in  the  institute  is                     mistaken  for vocation;  she does so for her convenience and by a trick of the                     devil  who  wants  to  ruin  our  houses.    We  cannot    wait  for    her    eventual                     conversion,  which can  never  come.  On  the contrary,","we    have  to  keep  our  houses  and  the  souls  entrusted  to  us  free  from  such  a                     subversive person (S.C. Vol. 8, page l92).                       6. Correction                             Before making the decision to expel a person, the Father did his  best  to make                     the guilty admit  his/her  faults.  Correction aimed at this.  He writes to superiors                     and subjects wise rules on this topic.                           Who  receives  corrections shows that he is a  simple-minded person  well                     disposed to virtue;  on the  contrary,  who  refuses corrections shows that he is a                     proud, incorrigible person.                           We  warmly  exhort  the probationers  to  humble  themselves interiorly when                     they are corrected,  and to accept the punishment as deserving of it; otherwise                     selfishness  will  deceive  them.    The  probationer    who  longs  for  religious  life                     recognizes his  failure every time he is corrected;  if he did not, he would be                     unable  to  improve  virtue,    and  his  vocation  would  appear  fallacious.  Let  us                     remember  the  words  of  the  psalmist:    \"A  virtuous  man  may  strike  me  in        528                     reproof, for my own good, but a wicked one shall never anoint my head with                     oil\" (Ps.  l40, 5). (S.C. Vol. l0, page l75). If  ever the superiors warn or admonish                     me for my faults,  I will receive their warnings and admonitions with humility of                     heart and with all my soul, without  justifying myself or arguing about it; on the                     contrary,    I  will  acknowledge  my  fault  with  humble,  simple  heart    and  will                     amend.  If I am not aware of the  fault,  I  will consider my being unable to see it                     as due to my selfishness which has dimmed my sight,  and,  therefore, I need to                     humiliate myself twice in my heart.  If I am sure I have not fallen into the fault I                     am charged with,  for humility and prudence's sake I will keep silence or I will                     justify myself calmly and with simplicity  once or twice (Vol. 44, page l20).                           Here there are some thoughts for the superiors.                           Correcting  his subjects' defects is a hardest task for  the superior.  The more                     this task is of importance, the harder it is when the superior","undertakes it without  appropriate  caution, because he may fail and harm, instead of                     correcting.                           Nothing is as delicate as correcting.  Correcting  is like a drug;  when  its dose is                     wrong or the drug itself is mistaken  it may  be  poison  or at least  dangerous.  For                     instance,  if  you reproach when a reserved judgment  should be enough, or you scold                     when  a sweet word is needed,  it is like administering  a  wrong drug,  which is harmful                     instead  of  healing.  Oh,  how  much  ruin  the  wrong      corrections    bring    about!    To                     perform his duty well, therefore, the superior must diagnose the defects.                           First,  he  has  to  understand,  know,  value,  and  be  fully  aware  of    his    subjects'                     defects  by  resorting  to  prayer,  divine enlightenment,  and  careful  attention.  He has                     to  spiritually diagnose  each  subject in order to understand the roots  of  the defects,                     for  they  are  different  from  person  to  person.    Some    of  the  roots  are  deeper,  others                     shallow;  here,  there  is  more  malice,  there,  more  weakness  and  fragility.  The                     understanding  of various individuals'  defects  is  indispensable for the  application  of                     remedies.                           To  understand the individuals with their  defects,  nature, and  character,  so as to                     apply  the  right  remedy,    each    superior  will  pray  insistently  to  God  to  obtain                     enlightenment.    The    daily  prayer    must  be  said  in  each  particular  case  through  an                     intimate invocation  upon the Lord,  when correction is needed.  Our daily prayer  to                     the Lord and the most holy Virgin for helping  us  in dealing with subjects reaches its   529                     aim  when  we  pray  for  particular  cases,    especially  when  we  are  responsible  for  the                     people  and  ask  for    enlightenment.    In  such  cases  our  Lord  cannot  help    granting                     success.  But,  if  the  superiors  neglect the  remote  and  the immediate  prayer,   they                     will    lack    enlightenment    and    become  unworthy    of    it.    The    superior  must  pray                     continuously    to    win  enlightenment    on  how  to  guide  the  community  and  the                     individuals. In  particular cases,  when the matter is urgent,  he  will  pray interiorly,                     even for a moment before acting.                           The  person  who corrects should follow  these  rules:                           The superior will beware of correcting under the impulse  of anger  or  indignation,                     avoiding    to  offend  the  subject    or    his  parents  by  talking,    for  instance,    about  his                     poverty, low birth, etc., because it hurts. When the superior becomes angry, he needs to                     restrain himself,  cooling down and delaying the  correction. Ecclesiasticus  says  that                     in anger people say many  words  that later  they find unjust.  Sometimes,  however,  the                     superior    may  correct    in  a  somewhat  loud  voice  if  zeal  requires  it.    But    true  zeal                     requires  that the superior be  devoutly  indignant,  self-controlled,  worried  for God's                     glory and salvation of  souls  as well as concerned with eliminating or remedying bad                     examples.  The  prophet  said  that  one  may  be  angry  without  sinning  (Ps.  4,5).  The                     superior will speak firmly,  will seriously consider the offense, and  will show that his                     attitude is from zeal,  not from anger or scorn.  Anger  and  scorn  are devastating to  the                     soul  of  the subject,  and  thrust him into diffidence and desperation.  Zeal, instead,  is                     pure charity, enlivens, and attracts, even though it sometimes","seems to throw down  (Vol.  l,  pages l39-l4l). Because the superior is not infallible,  \"as                     soon  as  he  perceives  that  he  has  miscalculated  the  correction,    he  will  pray  to  the                     Madonna of the  Remedy,   himself  starting  remedying  by  retracting   the correction                     directly or indirectly.  In case of need,  he will not hesitate  to redress the wrong by                     declaring plainly his  mistake, because  upholding  the  mistake is arrogance and  the                     cause  of serious   consequences.   We   must  implore   for   the   divine enlightenment                     in everything (Ibid. page l4l).                           Writes Father Vitale,  \"While correcting, he did his best to let  people  know                     that his aim was  correction  of  defects  and purification  of  their souls.  This                     motivation  led  him  more  than  once    to  relieve  someone  from  punishment,                     because    of    favorable  disposition    or    readiness    to    obey\"  (Father    Mary                     Hannibal  Di Francia, page 328).                          By  applying  these  rules,  the Father's  corrections  were effective.  He was                     so good that when he played the rigorous  role no  one  took offense,  rather                     found everything right.  He was  a Father to us in everything.                          I  relate  a  punishment he inflicted  on  me.                           \"I  was  the sacristan of the church in Oria  when  one  day after  mass,  the                     padre  called  me and asked me if  I  was  the sacristan. I answered, \"Yes, Padre.\"                          \"Did you prepare the hosts in the pyx?\" he asked.                          \"Yes, Padre.\"                                                                        530                          \"Don't  you know that the pyx must not be filled to the brim in order to avoid                     the host's falling to the ground?  This morning when  I  opened  the pyx,  one of                     them fell  upon  the  corporal; suppose it was consecrated and fell to the ground.                     Today you will do a penance...\"                          \"Willingly, padre; which one?\"                          \"Eat your lunch, kneeling.\"                          After the penance, when I went to ask pardon, the padre was writing.  While                     kneeling,  I began saying: \"Padre, I have come to beg your pardon for the grief I                     caused this morning...\"                          He  smiled  and  said:    \"It  was  not  a  grief,    because  the    host  was  not                     consecrated.  Sometimes,  I  correct  children  to  see  if  they  are  humble.  Do  not                     worry. God bless you.\"                           One  day I was rushing through the corridor in front of  his","room.  He  peered  out  the door,  with a  gesture  of  his  hand indicated to be                     moderate,  and smiling said,  \"Don't you remember Dante  saying,  'haste mars all                     decency of act?' (Purgatory III, ll).  Haste steals perfection from things,  mars                     things.  You can go, but without rushing.\" A sister says, \"Once I was running                     down the  stairs.  The  Father  stopped me  saying,  'My  daughter,  a Religious                     should not walk like that;  it breaks the  silence.  We have  to respect the Lord's                     house,  otherwise everything comes to an end, to an end'.\"                           Once  he  called  to  order  a  novice  and  sent  her  to  the  feet  of  the  Blessed                     Sacrament. In the evening, talking to all the novices in  a way that the interested                     person could understand,  he  said, \"Daughters,  you have not to lose hearts when                     you happen to  fall into  defects,  nor will the others wonder about that.  The                     Lord covers with defects the good He has and will infuse in souls, but we  have                     to correspond to him with humility and trust.  You  must also  know  (and here he                     stressed the words) that having an alive character  is a grace from the Lord and                     we  should  thank    him    and  profit  by  it,    because  it  helps  us  to  become  holy.                     Therefore, the ones  should  not lose hearts,  nor will the others  wonder.\"  By                     insisting  on  the grace of having an alive character he  soothed the heart of the                     youth who was so in need of comfort.                           The  Father  once asked the mother superior of  Taormina  to send someone,                     for he had to dictate a few letters.  The superior sent a new aspirant. As soon as        531                     she finished writing the sentence the  Father had dictated,  she looked at him as                     to invite him  to continue.  After  she had done so a couple of times,  the  Father                     said,  \"I  am recalling my grand mother.\" The youth kept  silent, but  Brother                     Mary  Anthony who was on the Father's  side  asked, \"Why,  padre?\"  And  he                     responded  to  him  in  such  a  way    that    the  youth    could  hear.    \"Because  my                     grandmother suffered  grief  when people  looked  at her!\" The youth understood                     and looked  at  the Father no longer.                           Sister  Mary  Beatrice  once  behaved  improperly  with  the Rogationists,  and                     the Father warned her; soon after, however, he consoled her with a card.  \"To                     Mary Beatrice, my dear daughter in Jesus  Christ.  A  token and a blessing from                     the  padre  for  her docility  and humility in receiving the Fatherly warning.  It                     was due  to an overlooked fault against the respectful relations  one should ever                     have with the priestly religious community.  Messina, July l4, l926. The padre\"                     (Vol. 34, page 52).                           The same sister recalls the Father's exceptional manners  on the occasion of                     her entering the novitiate.  It is the first time I hear of such things.","“On the eve of my taking the garb together with three youth, the  Father  showed                     several  tools  of    discipline    in    a    basket,  hinting  at  the  sacrifices  and                     renunciations we had to face in the religious  life.  He did so to test us.  The day                     we took the garb the Father ordered us to kiss the sisters' and the maids' feet at                     refectory.  We  received our food from them as alms,  in  the poorest plates we                     had in the house.\"                           While    talking    with  the  Father,    one  had  to    weigh    his/her  words  and                     gestures.                           The    Padre    recommended  that  we  be  careful  about    our    inner  lives,    use                     proper speech suitable to human actions,  and  avoid covering  a vice with the                     appearance of a virtue.  When  we  were with  him,  we had to watch our words                     and gestures as not to  see him  grimace.   He  prohibited  to  hold  the  exactness                     in    the  observance  of  the  virtue  as  scruple,    to  call  human  dignity  one's  own                     selfishness, to say that it is peculiar to a strong character not to accept the opinion                     of  others  when  it  depends  on  pride,  and  to  call  our  speaking  frankness  and                     simplicity when we ought to be silent (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page                     308). So many acts, unnoticed by us,  caught his attention,  e. g. putting one's feet                     on a chair,  passing in front of the Holy Sacrament while holding a  package  in                     one's hands,  laughing with no  moderation  in  a respected  person's presence,                     gossiping,  charging someone  with ignorance  without  pointing out why,  and             532                     the  like.  For  him, avoidance  of  such  things  was fundamental  in  achieving                     holy perfection (Ibid. page 309).                           As  to  murmuring,  Father  Caudo  recalls  how  the  Father silenced a fellow.                     \"I do not know if what  you are saying is true; but it is true that your fault in                     speaking badly of your brother is worse than his fault\" (La Scintilla, August 20,                     l95l).    I  remember  another  episode  concerning  Father  Caudo.    A  priest  from                     Catania had sent to the Father a complimentary book bearing the following title,                     My Trip to Lourdes.  The Father was willing to reciprocate the gift by sending                     the book by Father Caudo, From Messina to Lourdes, and told me to ask for it.                     Father    Caudo,  however,  expressed  the  opinion  that  it  would  be  improper,                     because  that  priest  had  cribbed  from  his  book.    The  Father  was  astonished                     because  he  could  not understand how a fellow could  publish  a literary  theft                     as  his  own writing.  I  had  to  prove  it  by submitting to him the passages                     plagiarized word by word.  Sure of the  fact,  the  Father  told  me smiling and                     with    a    touch    of  patriotism,    \"That's  enough,    that's  enough,    we  have                     understood. Catania","copied out Messina.\"                          As  required  by  charity,  the Father spared  no  one  when correction was                     needed.                           Listen  to  Father  Vitale:                           \"I  remember that we burst out laughing for one's trumped-up answer.  The                     Father  was  sitting near me  and  said  prudently,  'Don't  laugh.'  Another time I                     was talking with a few  Daughters of  Divine  Zeal about a certain topic in the                     mother  superior's presence.  While  speaking,  I addressed a  sister,  because  she                     seemed to understand better than the others.  When the padre gave me the eye, I                     did not understand why.  Then he handed me a piece of  paper  with these words                     written on it:  'Address  the  mother superior.'  I knew that to avoid speaking to                     her was to discredit her;  therefore, I turned to her.\"                           On  another  occasion  the  Father  gave  the  chance  of  a renunciation to                     Father Vitale,  who had written from Oria to  his sister  at the Holy Spirit in                     Messina.  The Father  wrote,  \"Your sister is doing well, but I have not handed                     your picture postcard to  her.  Sensibility  and  flesh should not rule  us;  they  are                     deceivers!\" (Vol. 3l, page 20).                          A sister was displeased with her transfer to Altamura, which caused   her  so                     many  indispositions...   The   Father   writes paternally,                               533                           Daughter   in   Jesus  Christ,   please  see   whether   the indisposition  you                     plead depends on the regret that you  live  in Altamura,     far  from the house of                     Trani.  The air is excellent in Altamura.   You  have  no  disease.  Your  physical                     weakness  is increased  by  prostration because you live in  this  house  with                     regret.  It  is  homesickness,  due to lack of submission and  of virtue.  You  are                     not making a steady resolution to  live  where obedience wants you to.  You are                     not praying to the Lord and  the most  holy  Virgin  for help to live where the                     divine  will  has placed  you.  You  are  like  a child  crying  and  seeking  mom.                     Daughter,  you  must know that when a  youth dislikes  being in a  house, she  is                     affected  by  homesickness.    It  is  a  moral    disease  causing  other  diseases                     apparently.  It can cause even fever! When a young Religious understands that                     holy obedience and the  Lord's will  want  her to stay in a place,  she stands fast                     against  the temptations  of the devil and of nature.  She does not fall  sick but is                     full of peace, strength, and health!...  Blessed daughter, be calm,  take courage,                     be  in  a  happy  mood,  do  not  behave  like  a  child.      As    a    Religious,    show                     faithfulness to  your  celestial spouse.  Resume  your  work little by little,  and                     be  perfectly obedient to your good mother superior. God helps all the obedient                     souls! I hope to hear good news of you! (Vol. 34, page 62).                           Sometimes people appealed to the Father for trifles,  and he tried to illumine                     the good daughters... He writes to the superior","general,  \"Please  tell  Sister  Mary  Letteria  that  I  have  no  time  to  answer                     superfluous questions! For instance,  if tomorrow she asks me  whether she can                     eat her food at refectory,  should I  answer? Does  she  think  that writing does                     not  cost  me  anything?  My blessing\" (Vol. 35, page l72).                           He did not even spare the superior general.  She ought to be irreproachable  in                     everything.    Once,    she  wrote  a  letter    to    a  superior  with  a  tone  the  Father                     disliked, and therefore he wrote, \"As  to the letter you sent to her,  I have cut the                     passage I  am enclosing;  I  thought  it was not good.  Blessed  daughter,  you                     should be always polite,  affable, and humble especially with the elders and the                     superiors;  otherwise  you  shock\"  (Vol.  35,  page  4).  On  another  occasion  he                     insists,  \"Blessed daughter,  I beg you to be moderate,  humble,  respectful, and                     edifying when you write to the spouses of Jesus Christ.  We should avoid to get                     our  sisters accustomed to a worldly tone,  or to resentment, and the like. We                     have  to talk as Religious.  The Lord says,  'Grace is poured out upon your lips;                     thus God has blessed you forever' (Ps.  45,  3); and,  'The lute and the harp offer                     sweet melody,  but better than either,   a voice that is true'\" (Eccl.  40,  2l). (Vol.                     36, page l86).  He  writes  again to her,  \"Do you see how we  take  false steps?                     Scripture says,  'One often gives vent to his wrath,  and then he perceives he is                     mistaken'\" (Ibid.).  As to slips, \"A soul can be lost in a moment! Besides,  it was                     the Lord's will, but we must pray to be illumined on how to lead souls;  it is a          534                     delicate matter\" (Vol. 35, page 49).                           One  day Mother Nazzarena was told to apologize  before  all for having been                     late some moments in a community's act.  Writes a sister,  \"On  one occasion he                     called  the  mother  superior  who    was  correcting    me  excitedly  and  told  her,                     'Sister,  do not  oppress her'!\"                           Nice is the following call to order. The negotiations to buy a  land  in Padua                     were pending,  the day of expiration was  near, money was needed urgently, and                     no  news  was  coming  from  Messina...  Finally    a    letter  was  delivered,    which                     announced  in  the  last lines,  as  a  matter of no importance,  that the money had                     been sent.  Listen to the Father.                             \"This morning I have received  your registered  letter and the insured one                     from Canon Celona with the money  order of 38,000 liras.  Because of the postal                     delay, the Franciscan friars were afraid that no money","would  come.  To  assure  them    and    to  know  something  about  the    money,    I                     transmitted  a telegram.  Half  an  hour had hardly passed when I received  your                     registered  letter.  Anxious,  I went through the letter with  my eyes,  but...  you                     were  writing of everything except  the  main thing! You talked of Altamura,                     Melanie,  Mastropasqua, Procopio, my  health,  etc.  After reading two pages I                     was losing the  hope that the money had been sent. Lo and below! In the third                     page, as a  matter  of no importance and in the midst of other  pieces  of news,  I                     found  that  you  had  entrusted  Canon  Celona  with    sending  the  money.  I  have                     described my going through all these details to say that common sense is needed                     when you write...  Only Sister M. Carmel  D'Amore  puts  everything  in  order                     when  she   writes, informing of everything.  But because you too have got your                     share of brains, you can do as well as she does by paying attention. It perhaps                     happens  because  she  is  not  worried  as  you  are.    You  see,  for  instance,  how  I                     began this letter; I informed you that I have received the 35 cents you have sent. I                     think it pleases you. But, if  I had talked of everything in two or three pages,  you                     would have  remained  doubtful of the matter which is at  your  heart.\" Then  he                     concludes,  \"Now it is enough with this short  literary, philosophical instruction\"                     (S.C. Vol. 5, page 242).                          Above all, the spiritual life of Mother Nazzarena interested the Father. One                     day  he  wrote  to  her,  \"Unless  grace  illumines  you,  and  you  overcome  the                     predominating  passion,    viz.,    attachment  to  one's  own  opinion,    you  will  not   535                     become holy\" (Vol. 3l, page l0). Writing about some vocations,  \"I beg you to                     detach yourself from your  own  opinion...  Do you think that such attachment                     does    no  evil    to    your  soul?    That  you  are  going  to    expiate    nothing    in                     purgatory?\"  (Vol.  35,  59).  Because  a sister in a  commanding position caused                     disorder,  he wrote to her,  \"I always said  that you  are  not fit for commanding                     or  watching  over:    some    persons  become  unbalanced  in  the  commanding                     position\" (Vol.  35,  56). On another occasion, \"I found two little reactions or                     resentments in your last letter!...  Take care of your interior life\" (Vol.  36, page                     47).                          The Father did not even spare Melanie.  And yet, he held her as \"a first rate                     saint,  full with God's spirit,  very  innocent, enamored of Jesus and Mary,  and a                     penitent soul\" (Vol.  42, page 60).  As a daughter of Adam,  Melanie too was                     imperfect,  and the Father points out that her defects cast a shadow on her. \"So                     that this  shadow disappear it is necessary to listen to the voice  of miracles,  to                     which  one cannot resist.  Otherwise Melanie  will never reach the honor of the                     altars\" (S.C. Vol. 8, page 69).                          Because  Saint Jerome knew the works and the merits  of  the holy  bishop of                     Nola,  Saint Paulinus,  he wrote from the  desert demanding  of him excellency in                     everything.  \"I cannot suffer any","mediocrity  in  you,    because  I  long  that  you  achieve  everything  at  the  highest                     degree\" (Hier.  epist.  58 ad Paulinum).  So did  the Father  with Melanie.  He                     wanted  her  holy  in  order  to  certify  the  apparition  of  the  Madonna  with  her                     personal life.  Therefore,  he did not spare her,  even though he behaved very                     kindly.    \"Dearest  mother,  I  beg  you  to  pardon  me  if  sometimes  I  had  the                     presumption to correct you.  I did so out of love for Jesus, and because I am very                     interested that the little shepherd of the most holy Mary be irreproachable  and                     holy.  You must bear witness  to  the  great apparition,  keeping the devil from                     working against our Mother of La Salette\" (S.C. Vol. 8, page ll).                           Melanie  was  inclined to exceed in rigor.  That's  how  the Father  invites her                     to be kind in the government of the community of the Holy Spirit:                           I    hand  over  to  your  benign  charity  and  tender    mercy    these  daughters,                     especially the unruly, faulty, imperfect ones. May  you be  the  good shepherd                     who tracks the lost sheep and guides  them again  to  the  fold  of  the  celestial                     lover,    caressing    them  lovingly!  The  sweet,    benign,    loving  word  spoken  at                     proper  time heartens the weak souls,  infuses hope and trust, and urges to do                     well. \"A word in season, how good it is!\" (Prov. l5, 23). But, if you  see in God                     that some of these daughters do not deserve  that word  because  they take no                     profit by it,  you will  never  cease praying  to  the beautiful mother Mary to           536                     convert them,  to  have mercy  on these wounded doves.  May she pour out on                     their  wounds the wine of the right rigor,  the oil of holy charity,  and mercy to                     win all of them to Jesus. Amen (Vol. 42, page l07).                       7. Always heartening                             We make a summary choice from the Father's writings.                          In  the  early  times  of the foundation he  writes  to  the sisters,                           \"In  the  foundation  of this  Pious  Institution  the  Lord requires  a lot of                     sacrifices  because  its  destiny  will  be  perhaps  great.    Meantime,  blessed                     daughters, strengthen your heart and","look    after  your  sanctification;    be  zealous  for  the  divine  glory  and    for    the                     salvation of souls;  pray fervently  to  win  good workers  to the holy Church,                     and be sure that Jesus Christ  will comfort and console you\" (Vol. 34, page 2).                           To    the  probationers  of  Oria  candidates  for  the  sacred    garb  he  wrote,                     \"Dearest children, may your holy wish be the result of your ardent love for Jesus.                     Love for Jesus,  our  goodness,  and longing  to  be  consecrated to his divine                     service  are  a  great happiness! Dearest children,  please practice divine love and                     the virtue  of humility,  which is the base of the other virtues.  Be pure as angels,                     because Jesus loves so much the innocent  souls. May holy obedience be your                     joy. May Jesus make you belong totally to him and not at all to this bad world\"                     (S.C.  Vol. 5, page 40). Answering the wishes for Easter,  the Father wrote,  \"I                     thank  you  heartily    for    your    wishes  and  return    them    twice.    May    Jesus,                     supreme    goodness,    infuse    his  holy  love  in  you  so  that  you    may  think  of,                     desire,  and yearn for Jesus only.  Dearest  children, consider  the  grace  of  the                     holy vocation  you  are  given  and endeavor to correspond to it. Love so much                     the  holy  virtues,  also  counting    on    the  little  things.\"  Because  in  those  times                     several Religious were at the front,  the Father concludes, \"I beg you to pray for                     your brethren who are in the army\" (S.C.  Vol.  5,  page 42).  He writes to Father                     Vitale,  \"Please tell our dearest young Rogationists  the best things on my behalf.                     I always  pray  that they become holy.  The Heart of Jesus is expecting that they         537                     turn out well.  If they meet his most holy aims, they will be happy !\" (Vol. 33,                     page 52).                           The  Father once felt bound to humiliate a sister;  but,   in the  evening he                     asked the mother superior to send that sister  to say the rosary with him.  Because                     she was indisposed and had gone to  bed,  the  superior  sent  another  sister,  but                     the    Father  dismissed    her.    The  following  morning  he  said  to  the  humiliated                     sister, \"Yesterday in the evening I called  you to say the rosary, because I had                     wounded your heart.\"                           The Father sent the following letter to a superior on behalf of Jesus.                           Jesus to her beloved daughter and spouse.  Never distrust my mercy.  You  are                     dear to me,  and the aim of your pure  intention wounds my heart.  I love you                     with endless love.  Pay your service to me with a joyous heart;  but when you                     feel like crying,  do so with me and my mother.  My love and will,  humility and                     obedience are your nourishment.  Treat everyone with wisdom,  prudence,  and                     charity.    Pray  to  me  so  much  for  the  souls  entrusted  to  you,  and  do  nothing                     without appealing to me for","enlightenment and help. My daughter and spouse,  I bless you.  If you are faithful                     to me,  I will  have a crown prepared for you in heaven.  Your Jesus  (Vol. 34,                     page 40).                           A  sister  who  felt the burden of  obedience  received  the following letter                     from the Father:  \"Consider the great  happiness of  belonging to God through the                     religious  vows.    Don't  be  afraid  of  the  vow  of  holy  obedience,  because  Jesus                     Christ said, 'My yoke is easy and my burden light' (Mt.  ll,  30). When you obey,                     think of obeying the most holy Virgin;  in fact,  you know that she  is the Divine                     Superior\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page 26l).                           Despite the Father had tried to make a sister understand the false  step she was                     taking,  she decided to leave.   He wrote  to her,  \"Obviously,  I  am grieved for                     several reasons,  but I feel peace  in my conscience since I have always taught                     you the  truth without nurturing your selfishness\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page 336).                           A  good,  but  somewhat  ugly  sister  had  a  bad  breath.  Reports  a  sister,                     \"Naturally,    dealing    with  her  in  our    conversations    or  casual  meeting  was                     unpleasant.  But,  for this very reason,   the Servant  of  God often took her in his                     travels and preferred  her when he had to dictate something.  The poor sister used                     to say in her simplicity, \"How good the Father was! He was fond of me!\"                   538                           The  superior general,  Mother Nazzarena,  needed a  lot  of encouragement                     because      of  the  troubles  inherent  to  her    office,  and  the  Servant  of  God  was                     always a Father to her.                           Keep  firm without losing heart;   Jesus and Mary  are  with you.  The  elder                     faithful sisters are few.  Be united,  love  one another too much,  and immolate                     yourselves for the institution of the Lord! (Vol.  35, page 52). I am proud for                     your  cooperation  in  the    Lord;    in  fact,    you  have  been  always    a    docile,                     obedient  daughter.    I    would    rather    say  that  you  have    been    a    faithful                     companion  in  the institute's vicissitudes,  as well as  in  the sacrifices  we are                     facing for our holy ideal.  But our great hope of fulfilling good wishes comforts                     us (Vol.  35,  page  5).  Look after  your spirit by paying attention to the fear of                     God;  avoid to tire yourself with distrust and discouragement, but let divine will                     and obedience guide you;  else, you lose heart in vain (Vol. 35, page 39).                           On  the  subject of the community's  defects:  \"Do  not  cry behaving  like a                     child.  I have not understood whether the  grave","defects are by the children, or the probationers, or the sisters. You  must  give a                     clear explanation,  otherwise I cannot be  sure from afar.  However,  the divine                     superior  will  see  to  everything,  be  calm\"  (Vol.    35,  page  ll2).  On  another                     occasion: \"Cheer up. It is  written,  'In the evening grief,  in the morning joy.'                     Jesus will  console you,  because you have committed your life to  him\" (Vol.                     36, page l40). For her name's day: \"I wish you to continue working in the field of                     your soul,  bearing fruits in your  heart for Jesus\" (S.C.  Vol.  5, page 245).                           We  like to conclude with the following words which manifest the  Father's                     heart and form a golden rule for the government  of the communities.                           As to our affairs of Messina,  let us pray confidently.  The most  holy  Virgin                     will  not  abandon  us.    Cheer  up,    do    not    lose  heart,    see  to  it  that  rules  and                     discipline be observed,  and the youth be subject.  Be meek and authoritative,                     giving  example    of  observance,  discipline,  and  piety.  Trust  in  the  most  holy                     Virgin, whose  vicar  you are in the government of  the  community;  pray often                     to her with all your trust for the sake of her merits  and the  merits  of  Saint                     Joseph;  she will hear  you.  Holy  cross, suffering,  and  want  are  necessary in                     the  foundation  of  an institute,  but  happy are those who immolate themselves                     for  the consolation  of  the  most holy Heart of Jesus! The  Daughter  of Divine                     Zeal  must  be  very  zealous  in  carrying  the   cross, immolating  herself for the     539                     sanctification and salvation of souls (Vol. 36, page l72).                         8. Always for the material                            and spiritual good of his children                              The   Servant  of  God's  government  was  always   prudent, carefully aiming                     at our material and spiritual good.                          The Father went so far in his charity as to prohibit  anyone to go out of the                     refectory to avoid disturbing the meal.                          In  the  male communities,  above all in  winter  time,  the Servant  of  God                     was   seen more than once  walking  through  the dormitories  in  the night to                     eliminate currents of  air  and  to check","that everyone be warm and provided with blankets.                           He   often exhorted the  mother superior to avoid any   warning  against   the                     Religious before ascertaining their fault;  and  the humiliation  from a public fault                     should be enough  by itself.  So says a sister. He never scolded anyone in the                     presence of others, except for fault committed in public.                           When  Mother  D'  Amore died,  the community  of  Trani  was shocked.  \"In                     this event we saw how the splendor of the  Father's charity  shone.  He  watched                     over the  cooking  every  day,  was attentive  in the refectory so that nothing be                     lacking,  that the suffering have a more suitable food,  that  the sisters eat fresh                     eggs,  and nothing decay in the storehouse.                           Says a sister,  \"He worried about our material work, keeping us  from carrying                     a heavy load.  To avoid going up and  down  the stairs twice, we had filled the                     soup kettle for the poor and were carrying  it;  the Father saw our unbalanced                     carrying and stopped us.  Despite our objections, he ordered to unload part of it.\"                     In Oria,  a  probationer  was  carrying a basket of  food  from  the kitchen to the                     cylindrical rotating tray.  The Father warned  her about  the  heavy load,  and he                     himself helped her carry  it.  On another  occasion  the same probationer was                     carrying a  load   of wood.  At sight of her, the Father became anxious and was                     calling the mother superior,  but the probationer lifted up the load with one hand        540                     to prove that it was not so heavy.  That calmed down the Servant of God.                           A  sister ascribes the merit of her vocation to the  Father. \"He supported and                     defended my vocation very Fatherly.  My   mother was  a  widow  with  three                     more children  and  was  opposing  my vocation,  causing grief to me and the                     Father,  who behaved  very patiently  and  charitably.  My mother tried to have                     me often  at home by feigning sick,  and the Father let me go,  helping her in                     various ways;  he even told me to buy the cake for her. My mother once feigned                     to be dying, and we, as well as the Father, sent for the doctor.  When we knew                     the truth,  I laughed at that  together with  the sisters.  The Father,  however,                     took it seriously  and  warned me for my lack of respect toward my mother. The                     Servant of God  overcame the obstacles my mother put in my way by  proposing                     to  take   my    little brothers in the institute  for  boys   and  by  paying for the                     sewing machine she had bought before I entered the congregation.\"","A novice was undergoing hard trials and was tempted to give in.  The Father met                     her in the advertisement office and told  her in a low voice,  \"I am recommending                     you to Our Lady every day  in the mass,  asking her to give you strength,  to                     make you win, and to be humble and obedient.  As to the taking of the vows, be                     calm and  sure;  you will take them at my first coming here.  I  bless you. Be                     calm.\" Peace began reigning in that heart.                           A lay brother ascribes a reading of the hearts to the Father \"When  I  entered                     the institute I felt it was unsuitable  to  me, therefore I wrote to my parents to                     come over and take me home.  I was  with  Father Vitale who had tried in vain to                     persuade me  to remain  and he was giving me the permission to  leave,  when                     the Father came in from the Holy Spirit.  Even though he did not know me  yet,                     nor did he know why I was with Father Vitale,  he said, 'This youth must stay.  A                     voice told me insistently this morning: go   to  Saint  Anthony's.'  I  remained,                     and  the   temptation disappeared.\"                           On  another  occasion  the  Father's  reading  of  hearts    revealed  a  Religious'                     defection. One day the reading at refectory was over and  the community was                     going to get up when Brother  Giambattista Noto  took  the reading book and                     began reading  by  himself.  The Father got up,  took the book from the brother,                     and put it on its place.  Back to his seat, he secretly  said to Father Vitale that the    541                     youth had no vocation.  We and Father Vitale amazed at that when we were told                     of the fact, because that second- or third liceo youth was a promising one.  But he                     abandoned the institute some years later.                           We glean episodes of another kind.                           A  sister reports,  \"I was going to the city of  Augusta  to pick  up  a former                     orphaned girl who had implored  material  and spiritual  help.  When I  arrived at                     the  Giardini  station,    I  saw  the  Father  who  handled  me  a  second  class  ticket                     saying, 'You need a second class ticket;  it is a long journey' (we used to  travel                     third  class).    Another  time  we  were  going  from  Naples  to  Trani  by  midnight                     train. The Father returned to the station after about an hour  we  had said good-                     by;  he was back to see from  beyond  the carriage  window if we had had dinner,                     and  if we had the  lunch basket for the following day.\"                           I like reporting a very modest episode concerning me,  which dates  back  to                     my  entrance  in  the  institute  of  Oria.    It  let    me  appreciate  the  Father's                     thoughtfulness.  As usual, the Father had talked  on  the Passion of Jesus and had                     shown a picture  of  the Crucified in the attitude of supreme pain and abandon.  I                     got up","saying,  \"Father,  can  you give me that picture?\" He  responded, \"Listen, son.  I                     have only this one, and I have to show it to the communities  as I did to you to                     excite your love to the suffering Jesus. But be sure, I will send you one.\"                           Months  passed  away  and I was  already  oblivious  of  the promise.  When                     Mr.  Pietro Palma came from Messina,  he told me, and “The  Father gave me an                     envelope, asking me to deliver it into your hands.\" It was the dear picture of the                     Crucified that I  am keeping  for  about 60 years as a dear token from the Father                     and his devotion to the Passion.  Among his worries,  the Father gave care for a                     boy.                           A  sister  wrote,                           As    soon    as  I  entered  the  community,    I  realized    the    holy  man's  great                     charity.  For example,  because he knew that I had an injured  leg,  he prohibited                     my doing any manual  work,  such  as carrying  heavy things,  picking up things                     fallen on the  ground, etc.  He was himself ready to do such things in order to                     avoid  my  suffering.    His    mildness  and  charity  were  evident  in  every    act,                     meeting,  and event.  Once I was told that the padre would punish me severely                     for a little fault I had.  Instead when I saw him,  I was received with a great smile                     and good words.  It was enough to soothe, hearten, and amend me.                          542                           He  also  gave  such an answer to a fellow brother  who  was suffering inner                     pains that the founder was unable to appease.  He said:  \"I can only ask the Lord                     to give me the bitter cup that causes you such agony\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di                     Francia, page 34l).                           The last time the Father was at Oria in November of l926, he felt  himself too                     feeble to visit and say good-by to the  sisters at Saint Benedict's;  therefore,  he                     made  them  come  down  to  Saint  Paschal's.  As  soon  as  he  perceived  that  the                     former orphan Salmeri was  absent (she was a member of the house),  he asked                     why.  The sisters  responded that it was due to her corns.  The Father sent the                     coach for her;  it was the Father's last staying in Oria  and he did not want to                     deprive her of his blessing.  She says, \"I was received with great Fatherly charity.                     He told me that he too was suffering  from  two  corns,  and suggested to  appeal                     to  Saint Charles Borromeo, who suffered by the same disturbance. He let me                     kiss his hand, as presaging that our meeting  was the last one.\"                           More episodes.","He suggested a triduo of prayers to a youth who was going to apply for                     admission to the Daughters of Divine Zeal.  He promised that he too would say                     the same prayers,  and added,  \"You wish to become  a sister;  you will,  but I                     wish three things  from  you: self-denial,  obedience,  and  conformity to God's                     will.\" Another youth  willing  to  apply for admission  was  told,  \"My  sisters                     compete in the humblest works, such as sweeping, cooking, washing dishes, etc.                     Do you like that?...\" These youths became sisters. A youth  was accompanied by                     her  confessor  to  the  Father    who    along  with  the  archbishop  and  Mother                     Nazzarena  was  treating  the  opening  of  the  house  in  Trani.  She  relates,  \"The                     Father  asked  me,  'Do  you  sweep?'    I    responded,    'Father,    I  will  learn!'  He                     received  me immediately. A youth who attended the sisters' laboratory went to                     him.  The  Father  asked many questions about her  vocation,  but delayed his                     decision and exhorted her to pray.  On September  29, l9l0,  while giving her                     Communion,  the Father looked at her in a particular  way.  Back  to the sacristy,                     before putting off  the sacred  vestments  he sent for the mother superior  and  for                     the youth,  asking her if she really wanted to become a sister.  Then he added, \"If                     I tell you to remain here without saying good-by to your parents,  do you agree?\"                     \"Yes,\"  she  said.    At  noon,  a  sister  accompanied    her  to  say  good-by  to  her                     parents.  The Father  told Mother  Dorothy  that by doing so he was carrying out                     a  special inspiration he had during the mass.                                                                                                               543                          Another  young  woman had decided to enter the community  on Ascension                     day.   The mother superior presented her to the Father with  this  motivation,                     \"She  wants to ascend  to  virtue.\"  \"Yes,\"   remarked  the Father,  \"but before                     ascending,    we    must  descend.    Jesus,    the  lily  of  the  valley,    is  down  in                     humility.\"  While  giving her the aspirant's apron,  the Father said,  \"Jesus did not                     come to be served, but to serve.\" One day he asked Sister Lucilla  to  carry a                     picture of the  Sacred  Heart.  While  going upstairs, he asked the sister, \"Have                     you taken the vows?\" \"Yes,\" she answered.  \"Then, you are a spouse of Jesus, a                     spouse of God! But being a spouse of Jesus means to be like Jesus,  and he has a                     crown of thorns: you too have to carry the thorns for the sake of Jesus...\"                           A  sister  saw the Father only once,  at his last  visit  in Trani,  when  she  was                     a  probationer.    In  the  meeting  the    Father  said,    \"This  year  you  will  take  the                     religious  garb.    I  exhort  you  to  pray,    to  pray  and  foster  your  enthusiasm  for                     prayer. You must compete in virtue.\"                           Some people recall the topics of the Father's conversations: \"the Passion of                     our Lord, the devotion to the Sacred Heart of","Jesus, Mary's sorrows, and our answering the grace of the Lord, above all on the                     part of the Religious.\"                           He  once talked about the religious  garb:                           Daughters,  what  great a grace from the Lord is wearing the religious garb                     and how we should correspond to it!                           But  woe to those who do not correspond...  By  itself,  the garb  of  a  person                     who does not correspond to the grace  of  God makes the angels weep.  They                     look at the souls entrusted to  them and  say,  \"Oh,  that garb,  that garb,  how                     unfitting  is  to  that  soul.    That  scapular,  how  unbecoming  is  to  her  behavior.                     Where  is  the  patience  of  that  soul?  She  loses  her  temper  for  trifles.\"  And  the                     angels,    my  daughters,    cry!  They  look  again  and  say,  \"She  wears  the  white                     modestino, but where is her modesty, purity, and mortification in order to keep                     herself pure before the angels?\" And they cry, my daughters. They look at the                     veil  and  say,  \"Where  is  her  recollection  in  God?    She  is  absent-minded,                     distracted  by  trifles,    and    nonsense...\"    By  continuing  with  such    penetrating                     words and a wailing voice he touched  and instilled in us a  very high feeling of                     respect to the religious garb.                           Another  sister  reports,  \"His lectures often made me  cry, because  his word       544                     was so penetrating as to touch  the   hearts.  I must also say that every time I                     approached the Father, one of his words was enough to console me.  He used to                     talk about the spirit of  sacrifice  and  self-denial.  We had to  offer  ourselves  as                     victims  to  atone for the offenses against Jesus in the  Blessed Sacrament,  for                     our faults,  and for the sins committed  in  the world. Such a spirit was rooted in                     his heart.\"                           He once asked the  sisters, \"Which is the  virtue crowning the others?\"  We                     tried  to  find  the  right  answer.    Finally,  a  sister  said,  perseverance.  Then  he                     lectured beautifully on the firmness of  perfection,  which  does not consist  of                     raptures,  visions, revelations, etc., but of practice of the virtue until the end of                     life, because only perseverance is crowned.                           We  emphasize again the Father's kindness.  He had  gathered the community                     for a lecture. Noticing the absence of a sister who was  resting  because she had                     to keep awake  in  the  night,  the Father said,  \"We delay the lecture so that all of                     you attend it. I  am interested that all of you listen to the word of  God.  The good                     of one soul has as much importance as the good of all.\"                           An extraordinary enlightenment from God showed up in","another episode.  Says a sister,  \"The Father was preaching in the chapel when                     suddenly he stopped to continue saying mass.  After the mass I asked about that                     interruption.  He responded, \"I knew that only six  persons  would profit by the                     word of God,  so I  stopped  to avoid the responsibility of the others.\"                         9. Mutual charity and respect                              The  Father wrote for us,                           \"Keep  jealously  the  union of hearts within the  bonds  of mutual  holy love,                     and hold one another as  beloved brothers  in Jesus Christ.  Observance of the                     rules,  practice of the virtues, and  avoidance of contradiction will help maintain                     such a  union. The apostle says,  'See to it that you abstain from controversies and                     quarrels'\" (Ti. 3, 9). (Vol. 3, page 23).                           The  Father was very attentive in keeping alive the  command of mutual love.         545                          When  little  fights  arose in  our  community,  the  Father reminded  us  of                     Jesus,  who forgave his  persecutors.  \"If  some quarrel  arose among the sisters,                     after making peace the  Father wanted no talk about it.  He did so after a sister's                     escape;  he received her back to the folk, and  everything was over.                           His  repeated exhortations on this topic showed his interest in  forgiving  one                     another eagerly,  as well as in  avoiding  the spirit  of vengeance or of grudge.                     Once,  a lay brothers did not talk with another one for a few days,  because of                     some  quarrels. The assistant wrote to the Father. The Servant of God answered                     by  a    special  delivery  letter  ordering  the  separation  of  the    guilty  from    the                     community,  depriving  him of the Communion (if he  did not  confess),  and                     threatening  him with expulsion in  case  of disobedience.                           One  more  teaching  by  the  Father,  substantiated  by  an example.                           When a Religious is touchy by nature, unless he amends, he is rude to others,                     or he charges them of some offense, or he is lacking in charity","and courtesy.  In such a case the devil is  on the  look-out  to infuse indignation                     and grudge in  the  offended person!  Fateful moment!  If that person yields to                     the temptation by  lack  of  virtue,  the  hearts  are  divided,  and   grumble,                     suspicion,    and  bad  example  follow.    Here,  the  superior  will  take  care  of  the                     offended person rather than of the offender.  He will appease  him  by  reminding                     him of the  holy  principles  and  by praying for him\" (Vol. l, page l36).                           In      the    first    months    of    l9l0    a    sectarian    persecution  suppressed    the                     orphanage for girls in Francavilla  Fontana.  The Father saved the orphanage for                     boys by transferring it to Messina in secret.  Back to Francavilla, he found the                     sisters shocked and upset.  They were living the fateful moment we have quoted                     above. They  could  feel  in their inner  fibers  sentiments  of  grudge against the                     offenders  of  whom  they  talked  openly.  It  could  be  the  beginning  of  spiritual                     decline,  as well as \"the beginning of the community's slackening.\"                           To  avoid  it,    the  Father  wrote  \"a  prayer    to  the  Holy  Spirit  for  our                     persecutors.\"  \"To obey our Lord Jesus Christ's most holy law  of  loving our                     enemies  and  praying  for  our    persecutors    and  slanderers,\"    he  asks  the  Holy                     Spirit  to  descend  \"powerfully    and  lovingly    in  the  hearts  and  minds  of  our                     persecutors as  well  as the  slanderers.  They afflicted us by persecuting and                     defaming these least institutions, upsetting and almost destroying some of them.\"         546                     He entreats the Holy Spirit to touch by repentance their hearts and to \"convert                     them to the most holy Heart of Jesus.\" He continues,  \"Write  them in the book of                     eternal life,  pour  your blessings and gifts,  and deliver them from the evil of                     body  and soul.  Assist and enlighten them,  above all in the hour of their death...                     We  present this supplication from the innermost of our hearts as we should for                     ourselves and for our dearest beloved. To obtain  this grace,  we are ready to                     suffer  whatever  sacrifice, even the loss of our lives, with your help\" (Vol. 4,                     page l23).                           This prayer was said by the community for several months.                           The  mutual respect based on the principles of faith is also a manifestation of                     charity.  The Father writes,  \"Besides  loving one  another  with pure love,  each                     one  will  respect  the    others,  imitating    the  example  of  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ\"                     (Vol.  3,  page 23).  He  specifies,                           \"I  will  combine  holy  love  with  my  sincere  respect  toward  the  institute's                     components, adults or children, superiors or fellows","or workers,  considering that God created, redeemed, and gathered them here;                     that our Lord gave up himself for each of them;  that he   feeds them with his                     divine body and Most Precious Blood more than often,  destining  them to eternal                     glory.  Avoiding to  even say  the  least  offensive word to a child,  I will  address                     the priests with the title of Father,  and will deal kindly with  the brothers, the                     poor, and the children\" (Vol. 44, page l2).                           He  wrote  to the  mother  superior:                           Besides  a  tender,  motherly love for  her  daughters,  the mother  superior                     must  have  a great respect  for  them  as  the spouses,  or  the  fiancees of Jesus                     Christ.  She will  show  her respect in such a prudent way that not one of them                     will  decrease her  own  reverential fear.  The mother superior will  never  say                     offensive  words,  nor  will  address worldly  warning  to  them. Needless  to                     say,  it does not prevent the mother superior  from correcting with dignity,  from                     warning,  and even from  punishing them.  Otherwise,  she  would respect their                     bodies,  but  despise their souls (Vol. l, page l30).                           We  must  point  out  how  the  Father  dealt  with  everyone;  he  had  all                     consideration even for a boy. I remember that the Father once asked the linen                     youth:                                                                                    547                          - May I beg you?                          - Yes, Father, command.                          - I need a towel.                          The    youth    could    not  help  being  amazed  and    told    everyone  about  the                     Father's kindness.                          A sister says,  \"One day the Father dictated to me a  letter addressed  to the                     mother superior of Trani,  Sister  Dorothy.  He asked  her  to transfer a sister                     from Trani to Altamura,  but  in such humble terms that I reasoned with myself,                     'What! He is the founder,  the superior,  everything in the congregation, and begs                     so  humbly?'  As  though  the  Father  had  listened  to  my  reasoning,  he  stopped,                     looked at me, and said, 'I respect my sisters, don't you know? This is the reason I                     write so, saying please.' Another time I had begun the letter by writing, 'By the                     Father's command,'...   He  said,  'I never give orders to the sisters.' I say   instead,                     'Would you mind doing this? Or, please be so kind...' I corrected my writing.\"                          Familiarity  which  comes  to  lack  of  respect  was  never approved  by  the                     Father.  An old proverb puts it, \"too much confidence comes to impoliteness.\"                     What we emphasize more on this subject is the Father's respect for his nearest                     cooperators, Father Vitale","and Father Palma.  Even though the Father was  the superior,  as  well  as older                     and  warm-hearted,    still    he    never  lowered    the  tune  of  respect  in  his                     conversation  with    them;    not  even    in  the  moments  of  great  cordiality  and                     confidence.    He    was  always  a  gentleman,    and  addressed  them  with    \"Your                     Reverence\" in any occasion.  The least title he used for them in his cordiality and                     confidence was the dialect Vossia, which stands for \"Your Lordship.\"                        10. Along with the sick                              Someone   questioned  a  Rogationist,  \"Do you know  if  the Servant of God                     had preferences for anyone within the  community?\" \"Yes,\" he responded, \"for                     those who suffered more.\"                           The  sick  are  the  first  in  suffering.  \"He  was  so  sensitive  to  other  people's                     suffering that if he had been able,  he would have spent  all his time in assisting                     the sick and suffering.  He used to  say,  'What great a mission it is to assist and                     comfort  the suffering'!\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 34l).                    548                           The    Father    wanted  us  to  take  care  of  our    health      without  being                     pathophobists. Once I did something imprudently; the Father warned me, \"You                     don't know how to appreciate health!' When we are healthy, we can do so much                     good!                           As   to   sight,   he  complained  that   \"our   communities underestimate its                     value,  and some even use to read in half light despite my continuous, repeated                     warnings\" (Vol. 36, page l66).                           He was concerned with our living in an orderly way.                           As for hygiene, I pride myself on the fact, for I follow the Kneip's system,  I                     have read the Mantegazza's treatise, and  keep hygiene seriously...  Air and light                     are the main factors of life, and   we complain that too many people ignore this                     important hygienic","rule,  which is so important.  It stands out among us... Thanks  to  God,  the                     prosperous health my orphans  are  enjoying depends mainly on the observance                     of this hygienic rule: air, air, always air, fresh air, new air, pure air by day and                     night, in the dormitory, in the laboratory, in the school, during play-time, in the                     refectory, and everywhere (Vol. 45, page 460-6l).                          A  patient and charitable Religious,  expert in how to  take care of the sick and                     how to receive, keep, and treat them... will perceive the people who do not feel                     well,  even when they conceal it, and in agreement with the superiors he will take                     care of them in the infirmary (Vol. 3, page 34).                           To  treat the sick and to help the people in their needs  we should not worry                     about expenses, even at the cost of pledging the house and the furniture of the                     church.                          Our sick were the special object of the Father's charity.                          Writes Father Vitale about the l887 cholera:                          \"Oh,    the  care,    the  kindness,  the  anxiety,  and  the  fears  of  the    Father    to                     safeguard the spiritual and bodily health of  his children!  More than a loving                     mother,  he would often  gaze  into their eyes trying to understand what fear or                     pain afflicted them, to know whether they needed special food or medical care\"                     (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 94).                          In  those  days,  the  priest  Don  Francis,  our  Founder's brother,  shared  in    549                     the  worries  and  the  cares  for  the    sick    of  Avignone.    Almost    half  of  the                     community was infected.  Rosina De Blasi,  a  former  orphan,  reports that Don                     Francis's  turn  in attending  the sick was 5:00 p.m.  to 12:00 midnight,  while  the                     Father's turn began at midnight. \"When he realized that all of us were resting,  he                     went to the church to pray, but now and then he checked to see if anyone needed                     help.  Besides,  he prevented the healthy  persons  from approaching the sick.  He                     chose  only  one nurse,  and   heartened her with these words,  \"May our Lord                     keep you  from any evil!\" In spite of being very delicate,  the  nurse suffered                     nothing  in  her assistance to  the  sick.  The  Father himself  played the role of                     nurse,  and he never went out of  the institute for fear that someone might die                     during  his  absence.  One  evening    he    gave  extreme  unction  to  five  sick  and                     attended  them all  night  long  together with his brother  Don  Francis.\"  Only                     Sarino, a five year old child died while saying the Hail Mary.                          The  Father  was always greatly concerned  with  bodily  and spiritual health.                     Brother Louis Mary Barbante reports,  \"One day the  Father  warned  me mildly                     because when he was absent  I  had followed  the  doctor's instruction and treated                     Brother  Francis affected by osseo-tubercolosis. When I fell sick, the Father sent                     me to Saint Pier Niceto for a change of air.\" Says a  sister,  \"I cannot  forget the                     very motherly care the Father used when I  was","sick.  He  accompanied me to Taormina and there he used to  visit the  ill  sisters                     always accompanied by another sister.\" \"He  was always anxious when we were                     sick, mobilizing superior and sisters to  attend  us.  A sister told me that when she                     was    affected    by  headache    the  Father  said  a  few    words    of    consolation,                     touched upon her head, and she was freed from pain.\"                           Listen  to a few reports about his very Fatherly  cares.                           \"A  fit of coughing was enough for him to say to the  mother superior, 'Send                     this daughter to bed for a couple of weeks.' If a sister  was pale,  he sent her to                     Guardia,  our country property. More than a Father,  he was a mother to us. 'Did                     you eat? Did you sleep?  Do  you  need anything?' These were  his  questions                     when someone  of  us was indisposed.  Some sisters were in  charge  to check the                     windows,  to avoid currents of air,  to change air.  It was  incredible  how he                     considered things in detail  so  that  we lack  nothing.  One day the sister who                     attended  Mother    Nazzarena  replaced    the    door    keeper  who  had  gone  to                     Taormina.  When  the  Father  saw  her  at  the  door,  he  sent       her  back  to                     Mother Nazzarena.\"                           Father  Drago reports that in l909 when the Father  went  to Francavilla,  he                     found two probationers sick.   Because we had no male community in Oria, the                     Father asked the benevolent Bishop Di Tommaso to lodge them in the seminary.              550                     They had lunch and dinner at Saint Benedict's. Around that time Father Palma                     was willing to go to Messina with the Father for urgent affairs, but he was told                     that  the  affair most urgent in that circumstance was  the  good health  of  the                     probationers.  After  a  couple  of  weeks,  the probationers recovered and  Father                     Palma descended to Messina.                           His  fatherly,  or better yet,  motherly care was for  every one;  for  children                     was  much  more  tender.    In  many    of    them    he  thought  of  seeing  sickness,                     paleness, need of treatment.                           \"While  giving Communion to the probationers,  he  perceived that  one of us                     was pale.  To recognize the pale one,  he touched upon  her with the Communion                     plate.  During  the  recreation,  he asked   who was the one he touched upon.                     'Me,' said one.  And the Father told the master,  'Please send her into the  country,                     she  needs  cure.'  A  sister  narrates:  \"A  sick  young  woman  was  sheltered  by                     charity.  She was reluctant to observing a no-salt  diet.  To hearten  her,  the                     Servant of God made the resolve to  join  the diet, and I began preparing his food                     with no salt. The day after,","however,    I    rebelled  and  prepared  the  normal  food;    the    Father,  however,                     refused it by saying, 'Why do you want to deprive me of an act of charity? I am                     doing so to hearten the sick'.\"                           Those  were times when tubercolosis was cured at  home,  and the  Father                     wrote,  \"Take  the necessary  precautions  to  avoid infection\" (Vol. 3, page 35).                           Sister  Camilla  was  young when she was in  charge  of  the infectious.  She                     testifies,    \"The  doctor  was  going  to  replace  me  with  an  older  sister  in  the                     assistance to the infectious, but the Father said, 'No, doctor, she won't fall sick;                     be sure.' Now I am 67 of age ( deposition of September 23,  l946). Since then I                     have been  working  in  the  infirmary but  I  never  fell  sick,  nor feverish;  the                     sisters know the Father's prophecy about me\"  (U. l4, 44)                           Visiting the communities,  the first care of the Father  was for the sick.  He                     once arrived very tired to Rome at midnight. As usual,  he  went  to the chapel to                     pray,  and after visiting  the Blessed Sacrament he asked information about the                     sick sisters.                           Also    while  traveling  the  Father  remembered    his    sick.    For  instance,    he                     writes to the mother general,  \" Right now I do not remember  the questions I                     should  make,    but  I  like  to  be  informed  about    Sister  Helen.    Tell  her  of  my   551                     blessings\"  (Vol.  36,  page l32). A few days after he writes, \"Tell Sister Helen                     that I bless her;  may she be strong in the Hearts of Jesus and Mary who  love                     her\"  (Vol.    36,    page  l37).  A  mother  superior  asked  the  Father  to  transfer  a                     tubercular  orphaned  girl  to  another  house.    The  Father  writes    to  the  mother                     general,                           This  pretence  cannot be allowed.  Please tell  the  mother superior that if the                     Lord has disposed this cross for that house, she  must  embrace it.  In similar                     cases,    none  ever    thought    of  transferring  the  sick.    Besides,      if  they  take                     precautions,  they  run    no  risk.    When  a  person  dies  surrounded  by    the                     community's charity,  she will pray for that community from heaven (Vol.  36,                     page l73).                           On  one hand,  we had no need to worry about money,  nor  to spare  sacrifice                     and care for the sick;   on the other hand,  the sick should behave as Religious                     and profit by sickness to  become holy. Therefore, he wrote for us,                           \"If I do not feel well or I need medical care, I will beware of  failing  because                     of sickness.  I will rely patiently  on  the superiors'  and  on the brethren's charity,                     holding that even  a sick  Religious  has to observe holy poverty and to  suffer                     some want  or  negligence","as permitted by God in order to  set  better examples;  as a matter of fact, the                     good soldier is tested in the battle\" (Vol. 44, page l37).                           He tells the nurse that is part of his/her duty to take care for the piety and the                     recollection of the sick in order to foster union with God.                           \"The male nurse will also see to it that devotion and  piety be  observed in the                     infirmary.  Paying careful attention that the holy Communion be available to the                     sick every day,  he  will read spiritual passages for those who are able to listen,                     will exhort the sick  to cheerfulness and patience,  will prevent defects and idle                     talk, making them bear in mind that the devil makes the sick relax when bodily                     health only is cared for\" (Vol. 3, page 35).                           Writing to the sick,  the Father often reminded them of  the spiritual profit                     they had to draw from illness.  \"We are spending and  have spent so much money                     for your health,  and we hope  that your behavior will bless it\" (Vol.  34,  page                     ll).  After a major surgery, Sister D'Amore was feverish for seven months. The                     Father  writes    to  her,    \"Thus,    you  can  rise  to  a  new  life  of  observance  and                     humility.  If  you cannot receive holy  Communion,  you  can embrace the cross                     with the Crucified.  Be in divine presence, now and  then say ejaculatory prayers,                     and beg someone to read  from spiritual books for you\" (Vol. 34, page 2l). On             552                     another  occasion:  \"Do    not  worry  about  your  spirit,    because  suffering    helps                     more than prayer and action.  Have a pure intention, a sincere spirit, and  love for                     God.  Nothing else is needed\" (Vol.  34,  page 22). \"Conform  to the will of God,                     humble yourself,  and  suffer  all things  to  expiate  your sins.  We hope that  you                     will  recover reformed  in your spirit\" (Vol.  34,  page 24).  \"Because you are                     feverish,    be  cautious.  Since  the  doctor  orders  a  liquid  diet,  do  it  without                     complaining; otherwise you scandalize the probationer. It  takes time to recover.                     I exhort you to avoid any  defect  of words,  impatience, etc. Look a little bit after                     the spirit which is worthier than the body!\" (Vol.  34,  page 25). \"I am glad that                     you are doing better. May the divine superior grant you the grace of recovery.                     Declare  war  to  selfishness,    promising  docility  and  meekness\"  (Vol.  35,  page                     l23).","11. The first great war                              Beginning with August l,  l9l4,  the start of the great war, the  world waited                     for the news in trepidation.  In the saying  of Saint  Pius  X  the great war spread                     as fire to  almost  all  the European  nations  and  to America! The people hoped                     that  Italy remain neutral.  In February l9l5,  the Father pointed out to  an article                     of the Corriere della Sera which asserted,  on the ground of  reliable  information                     from Vienna,  that  Austria  was  well disposed  to  acknowledge  our rights on                     the    unredeemed    lands.  However,      our    Founder    wrote    to    Father    Vitale,                     \"Politically speaking,  we have good hints of no war in Italy: but I fear sin. The                     army does nothing but cursing!\" (Vol.  3l,  page 64).  Is it daring to say that war                     is a punishment from God? The fact is that Italy declared war and it was a long,                     hard, and bloody one!                           The greatest of the Father's worries was sin of the army  in that  time.  He                     wrote to a Religious at the front,  \"Such are the times, dearest son! People  are                     not prone to believe that Someone on  high  decides for the nations,  and  that                     curse,  scurrilous language,  and  dishonesty  of any army can put a good  cause                     in jeopardy!  To help our homeland,  the government should  prohibit and  punish                     such sins\" (Vol.  30,  page 93).  For this reason the Father  wrote a letter to the       553                     General Louis Cadorna in the  first months   of  the  war,  exhorting  him  to                     prohibit    cursing    and  scurrilous  language  in  the  army  in  order  to  draw  the                     blessing  of God.(2)                           He  enjoined his communities to say prayers for  peace,  and exhorted them to                     be observant and faithful to the Lord.  \"Observe perfectly  the religious virtues,                     loving Jesus and Mary  in  the religious actions,  prayer,  holy obedience,  and                     discipline.  By doing  so  you can trust that the most holy Hearts of  Jesus  and                     Mary  will protect you\" (S.C.  Vol.  5,  page 252).  \"Let us pray continuously and                     behave according to the strict fear of God. Tell it to everyone!\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page                     253).                           A regime of austerity was needed,  all the more because  the Father had no                     intention  to  be  stingy  with  the  poor.    As  usual,  he  behaved  according  to  the                     principles of faith.  First, he enjoined the  communities to expose \"the picture of                     Our Lady of Bread,  so that   the   most  holy  Virgin  kindly  provide  us   with                     the necessities.\"","Second,  he    gave    wise  rules  for    the    production,    saving,  conservation,  and                     rationing. As to the production:                           The  communities  having  agricultural  lands  will  culture    them  paying    the                     workers,  according to the custom of the  place.  If workers  are  lacking,  or the                     communities want to  save  on  the expenses  of the culture,  it is praiseworthy                     that the young  and even  the  sisters cultivate the lands.  It is time to  earn  our                     living  by the sweat of our brow...  To live,  we must snatch the food out of the                     land!                          If  you have no bread,  you can have  potatoes,  vegetables, cereals,  and fruits                     from  the  land.    To  live,    everything  is  good  with    the  blessing  of  the  Lord...                     Dearest  daughters,  any  work aiming at producing for you,  the orphans who ask                     for bread,  and the poor who knock at our door is blessed by the Lord.  Even pure                     vegetables  help  avoid  death.  Besides  the  culture  of  the  land,  you  can  raise                     animals,  such as chicken, doves, rabbits, pigs, goats, cows, etc. They help you                     the most.                           After treating about economics, preservation of commodities, and rationing,                     he concludes with Fatherly affection,                           Finally,  we beg you that the observance of these economical rules  deprive no       554                     one of the necessary nourishment.  We  have  to trust in the adorable Heart of                     Jesus, the most holy Virgin, Saint Joseph,  and  Saint Anthony of Padua.  They                     will help us until we are observant,  serve God, love Jesus and Mary, practice the                     holy  virtues,    follow    our    spiritual    industries,    and    work    without  sparing                     ourselves (Vol. 34, pages l25-l27).                           In  l9l7,  the  Father opened a house in  Altamura  for  the orphaned girls of                     the war, and in l9l7 he sent 8 sisters to Padua upon  request of the bishop of the                     city to serve in the  military hospital Belzoni.                          Obviously,  the consequences of the war were heavily felt in the  Rogationist                     institute,   because  several  of  its  members answered  the call to the army...  and                     the Father had to shoulder more burdens.                          The  beginning  of the war caught almost all of us  for  the military service.                     The holy Founder was deeply grieved,  but kept calm.  Each  of  us  received  his                     letters  full  of  trust  and tenderness.                          As  soon  as  he  received notice  that  his  children  were enlisted,  he  opened                     himself to Father Vitale,  \"Let  us  always praise the divine will! We are nothing.                     The Creator knows how to guide his creatures\" (Vol. 3l, page 58). \"Long live                     Jesus! Let us pray!","Poor  and  dear son,  the spirit cries! But let  us  leave everything and all of us in                     the adorable Heart of  Jesus!...  Let us  cry before the Lord! Now is time of wails                     and sighs! Heart of Jesus,  save us!\" (Vol.  32, page 86). When he knew of my                     call to the army,  he wrote,  \"I am told that you have been declared  fit for the                     war! What can I say?  I was grieved to tears,  but can we distrust  the  sweetest                     mercy of the most holy Heart  of  Jesus? Never! It is written (by Saint Paul) that                     everything is for  good to those who love and fear God\" (Vol. 30, page 90).                           Then   the  Father  wrote  the  \"prayer  for  our   brethren soldiers,\" which our                     communities said every day.  His children in the army were always a topic of his                     conversations,    speeches,  and  verses  on  the  Eucharistic  feast  of  July  first.  \"I                     assure you that we are continuously praying for all of you\" (Vol.  30,  page 92).                     \"Be sure that I never leave out the prayer for all of you\" (Ibid. page 94). \"It is a                     week since I  am in Rome. In a few days I will have a private audience with the                     Holy Father, God willing. I will ask a special blessing for you who are in the                     army\"  (Ibid.  page l02).  \"Do  not  lose  heart;  these are  ways  of  God.  Dearest                     children,  when you  come back,  as we firmly hope in the love of the  most  holy                     Heart of Jesus,  you will be already men fit  for becoming champions of Jesus                     Christ  and  his  Evangelical    Rogation!  Meantime  the  Lord  wants  you  to  pass                     through internal and external manifold sacrifices.  Who has never suffered,  what                     does he know? Surrender  yourself to the most holy Heart of Jesus and his  holy           555                     Mother, letting Providence guide you\" (Ibid. page l0l).                           How    the    Father  delighted  in  our  concord!  \"It  is    wonderful  how    from                     different  areas our dearest  children  soldiers   are united  in  a holy friendship                     and  brotherhood.    They    write    each  other,    giving  news,    informing  of  their                     destination,  and all of them  are  perfectly  united  to us  as  they  were  before.                     Our community is stronger now.  May the good Jesus give them back  to our                     houses!\" Vol. 32, page l32).                           Unfortunately,    the  war  made  a  casualty  among  us.    The  young  student,                     Brother    Mansueto  Drago,    died  while  fighting  on    Monte  Nero  (Carso),  on                     March  24,  l9l7.  The  Father  remembers  him  so,  \"He  was  an  exemplary,  well                     promising  youth; he has already succeeded to  enter paradise! We hope that the                     adorable Heart of Jesus  has taken him as a victim to save all of you\" (Vol. 30,                     page 84). The Father  perpetuated  the name of the victim in the hymn  of  July                     first l9l7:","Very merciful companion                                   Of our exile, see                                   The Rogate 's little folk                                   Sighing for you,                                   Who adores your decree                                   About our son Mansueto                                   You wanted to be with you.                                                             (Vol. 46, page 298).                           Another  victim of the war was a cousin of Brother Mansueto, the Rogationist                     lay Brother Mariano Drago.  He was  a soldier  in Palermo when he became blind                     in a few days.                           As  soon  as  the Father was informed of  the  grave  threat hanging over his                     dearest son,  he hastened to Palermo. From there he wrote to Father Vitale and                     Father Palma in Oria. \"The Lord has visited  us  with his cross always blessed!                     Calix meus inebrians quam  praeclarus est! Our dearest Brother Mariano is in  a                     grave  danger    of  becoming  blind!...\"  After  touching  upon  the  reasons  of  the                     spreading infection,  he continues,  \"Never my heart was  so pierced!  To  die                     young at the front is not the greatest  of  the sorrows,  as we thought! To lose                     sight at the age of 25,  and  to live  as though dead for forty,  fifty years is more     556                     terrible! By the grace of the Lord,  as Christians and ministers of the  Lord, we                     always praise and bless his very adorable will.  But, owing to our  fatherly love                     for  our  dearest  children  in  Jesus  Christ,    God  does    not  prohibit  us  from                     imploring a grace,  a grace!\"  (Vol. 32, page 5).                           The  Father  remained eleven days in Palermo  working  as  a nurse,  and                     together  with Father John Messina he tried to  take home  the poor son.  In a                     letter he narrates the painful work  he did to get the discharge papers.  People                     suspected that the young man had caused the disease (Vol. 32, page 9).                           On  February  l9,    l9l7,    the  remainder  of  his  sight  was    over  forever!  The                     Father writes on February 20,                           \"I  have  telegraphed  to  almost  all  of  our  houses  and monasteries,  as well                     as to Servants of God! I have entreated the adorable Heart of Jesus,  the most                     holy Mother,  the angels,  the saints,  Saint  Anthony  of Padua,  the holy souls in                     purgatory, Sister Teresa of the child Jesus...  I have put La Salette  water on  his                     eyes...  I  have signed him with the most holy  Name  of Jesus,  as Saint Vincent                     Ferreri suggests...but night supervened: his eyes closed in the darkness to open to                     eternal light,  as  we hope!\"","The patient's serenity consoled the Father greatly.  \"The many prayers people say                     for him draw the Lord's mercy on him, who has  been so deeply calm tonight.                     When I was leaving because  he dismissed me,  I heard something as though  he                     were  lamenting.    I  asked  what  the  matter  was.    He  calmly  responded,  \"I  am                     singing: Blood of the First Martyr!!!!...\" (Vol. 32, page 8).                           The  Father hoped that proper cures could save at least  one of the patient's                     eyes, because it seemed less damaged; it was all no good! The eye specialists                     agreed  upon  the  uselessness  of  human  treatment      in      that    case.      Prof.                     Cirincione,   oculist   of international fame said, \"Son, do not trust men, but only                     God!\"                           It    was  through  trust  in  God  that  the  Father  multiplied    and  made    people                     multiply the prayers for Brother Mariano's  healing. He took him to San Giovanni                     Rotondo, to Father Pio. He signed the dead eyes with the sign of the cross,  but                     they did not open.  To the  Father  asking  whether  there  was  any  hope  Father                     Pio responded,  \"Let us knock. What the Lord is not doing now, can do later...\"                           Failed  this  attempt,  the Father sent Brother  Mariano  to Pompei  \"at the feet                     of the One who is the channel of all  graces as  well as of the miracles of the                     divine mercy!\" He declared  to Father  Vitale:  \"I  do  not want to leave out the         557                     trust  in  the beloved  Hearts of Jesus and Mary.  Whether men are holy or  not,                     they are men;  but any good comes from above!\" Then he concludes, \"As  to our                     Brother Mariano,  he is very resigned.  Let us  adore divine will!\" (Ibid.).                           Even  though very resigned,  the dear youth  sometimes  felt dejected,  and                     once  that  he  complained  for  his  sad  condition,  the  Father  told  him,  \"Son,  to                     console you, I will pray to the Lord to give  you  back at least the sight of one                     eye by taking  it  away from me\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, pages 340-                     341).                        Notes                              (1)  Like a son,  Father Bonarrigo gathered the writings  and the memories of the                     Father,  who  once  wrote  to  Father  Palma,  \"This  morning    I  opened  the  big  case  and                     found in front of me a  bundle of papers with my poems of Taormina.   Who put it                     there?  Perhaps the holy soul of Father Bonarrigo\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 52).","(2) I have read this letter,  but no copy has been found  in the Father's writings.                           (3)  Father John Messina (1871-1949) was a priest  of  great zeal  and  charity.  To                     redeem the children of  the  people,  he founded  the \"Pious Work and Prayer House\" in                     the  Quarter  Saint Erasmus,  which  he  playfully defined,  \"Africa of Palermo.\"  We                     could call it the Avignone Quarter of Palermo.  To face the needs of his institution,  he                     founded the \"Orsoline Congregate,\"  under the rules of Saint Angela Merici. Out of the                     blue, one day he was ordered  by  the  mayor of Palermo to transfer his  community  to                     another place,  because his great, beautiful house disfigured the beauty of the seaside.                     Therefore, it should be destroyed!\" It was a great blow to him. His heart did not hold the                     news, and he died a few days later.   People,   however,  reacted against  the mayor's                     decision  and  the house remained  over  there...  In  1967,  the Orsoline  by  Father                     Messina  were associated  to  Don  Orione's \"Little Missionaries of Charity.\"                                                                                                                        558","l8.                                                                                       \"I LOVE                                                                     MY CHILDREN\"                                             l.

The origin of famous stanzas                              In need as usual, the Father had asked the administrators of                     the city  for  an extraordinary aid worthy l,000 liras  for  the feasts of middle                     August l902.                          The  city  administration  was  in  the  hands  of  the  Jacobins  of  the  Mountain,                     declared enemies of God and of the priests.                           At  the  August  l2  council  meeting,    the  socialist  party  (also  called  the                     'mountain' party) launched a full attack against Canon Di Francia, who sat in a                     corner of the hall in a section reserved for the public.  He received the 'kindest                     regards' from lovers of the  people.  One said that the padre did not know how to                     educate because he was a priest! Another declared that the philanthropist had a                     random  gathering  of  youths  united  under  no  ideal  direction!  Somebody    else                     spoke out against his hygienic  and  disciplinary methods!...   The proposal for                     money was rejected (FatherFather  Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page l7l).                           The way the Father was handled by the city council arose the protest of the                     Beacon (August l4).                                                                                                               560                          We  are not so touched by the rejection of a thousand  liras aid (we know the                     hellish hatred of the council's majority against the  religious  institutions).  But                     we feel  indignant   for  the slanderous   actions of those sirs  against the  most                     benefactor  of the  orphans and against his institutions.  They have covered him                     with  insults...saying that he has a random gathering of  youths. Pure slanders,                     because the orphans work in the  mill, the  bakery, tailoring,  typography,  and                     shoe-maker's all day long.  To learn morality,  we  should send the little girls to                     the Normal  Female institute,  and the boys...  to another one!\" On August  29,                     the newspaper points out,  \"By voting against l,000 liras to Canon Di Francia,                     the  counselors  did their worst and voted against  the will  of  the people,  who                     would give ten thousand liras  to  the angel of charity.                          On  this  occasion Lawyer Angel Toscano wrote  some  verses, praising God                     and exalting the beneficial mission of the Father of the orphans. (l)                          The Servant of God answered these verses with   a  poem,  a","jewel of his heart,  which the Rogationists can never forget.  He mailed  it  to  the                     lawyer on September 25  with  the  following dedication,   \"To  the  eminent  Dr.                     Angel  Toscano  who   with affectionate  verses  and kindness of heart heartened                     my  humble labors for the salvation of the abandoned orphans.\"                            As a note of pilgrim songs                               The sound of your pretty zither reaches my ear,                               O unknown friend, and prolongs                               The innocent love for my children, so dear.                               I love my children, they are for me                               The dearest ideal of my life.                               I rescued them from oblivion, giving them lee                               Urged from within by a hoping strife.                               Little Italian flowers, recent born yet                               Were easy prey of the abyss,                               No one gazed at them lovingly, nor met                               To make them happy with a bliss.                               Little children dispersed in the street                               Having no love, no joy, no smile.                               Oh, what a future, what a defeat                               Would have them crushed under their guile.                               Cleansed pearls are my little girls:                               I collected them from mud one by one,                                           561                               As shells from the streets of the churls.                               They have started off toward a civil run.                               They call me Padre: God's minister                               Lays his hands on their locks.                               They call mother: the sweet calls spur                               The Lord's chaste spouse to her flocks.

Most holy work                              Let  us  study  the  Servant of God as  the  Father  of  the orphans.  He was                     conspicuous for the charity toward his neighbor, but his most tender heart-beats                     were for the  orphans.  Referring to the beginning of the orphanage in Rome, a                     sister reports, \"The Father  dictated a prayer,  asking the Sacred Heart of Jesus                     and the  Madonna  to send the most mischievous orphans who  would  be easily                     lost,  unless  they  were sheltered  in  that  charitable place.\"                          The    Father's    apostolate  among  the  orphans  is  bound  to    the  Rogationist                     mission by ideal and history.                          He  writes,  \"It  is  by  charity  that  the  Heart  of  Jesus  said  in  his  zeal,    'Pray,                     therefore, to the owner of the harvest to send workers  to  gather in his harvest.' If                     we  broaden  our    heart    in  this  divine  charity,    we'll  fulfill  our  duty  of  good                     evangelical workers...\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page l96).                          The   Father himself relates how his institutions were historically tied to the                     Rogate. When he went in the midst of the Avignone rabble,  he remembered the                     gospel's  saying  of  the  crowds  without  a  shepherd,    the  Lord's  groan  for  the                     harvest  which    gets  lost,    and  the  divine  command,    \"Pray,    therefore,\"  etc.                     \"Since then,\"  he  says,  \"I committed myself to relieve that  abandoned crowd            562                     spiritually and materially \" (S.C. Vol. l0, page 207).                          Hence the orphanages.                          While teaching us,  the Father called our attention to these thoughts.  He  used                     to  say,    \"Because    the    priests    spread    the  kingdom    of  God,    they  are                     irreplaceable.  Children educated in a Christian  way will live saintly,  whereas                     the older who have not been educated so, will be easily unsound.\" And more than                     often  he  added,    \"Be  concerned  with  the  mud  in  the  streets,  i.e.,  with  the                     abandoned persons, because they sin and lead other people to sin. The  grace of                     the  Lord  also  works  upon  them.    Lombrosos'  opinion  about      the  delinquent                     child's  irretrievability   is   false.\"","Therefore the Father insisted upon the worthiness of the apostolate among the                     orphans.                           Saving    tender    children  is  a  holiest  work  to  which  we    will  attend  with                     sacrifice,  deeply aware of the excellent good we  do when  we take them away                     from  vagabondage,    risks,    and    depravity  and  provide  them  with  a  sound                     education and environment. Thus, by God's  help  we  form them to  become                     good  Christians,  perfect Catholics,  honest  and  industrious  citizens as  well  as                     good parents when they marry  (S.C.  Vol. l0, page l97).  Salvation of abandoned                     orphans will be one of the most cherished works of  the Rogationists of the Heart                     of  Jesus.  They  will  provide  the  orphans  with    a    sound  education  and  an                     appropriate    profession...      they  will  provide  them  with  the  things  they  need,                     especially when they are sick,  regarding the last of the orphans as the first of  the                     Fathers   (Vol.  3,  page  29).                           Beginning  the treatise on the orphanages,  he recalls these thoughts:                           Now    our  talk  is  about  the  orphanages,    which  represent    our  mission    of                     gathering  scattered,   poor,   abandoned,  orphaned children  in order to save                     them  spiritually    and    materially.    We  pursue    this    aim    by  delivering  the                     orphans  from  abandonment, depravity  of the  world,  hunger,  misery,  idleness,                     scandals, risks, and temporal and eternal ruin!                                           563                          How    much  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  delights  in  this  work  for  the                     abandoned orphans' salvation! What a conquest of souls is snatching them from                     the devil and bringing them to God!  (Vol. l, page 239).                           Snatching them!  The Father did so several  times   at  the beginning of the                     institution.  The rough,  dull-witted  mothers of Avignone    were refractory to                     civilization and virtue as well  as unable  to  understand  that sheltering their                     daughters  was  for their  good;  they  instead meant to sponge  the  Father's  zeal.                     Remember  how the Father sweated to recollect the orphaned  girls when  their                     mothers took them home because of Jensen's excess  of zeal.                          The orphaned Josephine Lembo is a case in point.  The Father snatched her                     from her relatives.  Those people fought to have her back,  but the Father did the                     same to keep her,  appealing to the Lord.  To save the Lembo, he wrote prayers                     to the Lord, Our Lady, and Saint Joseph.                           O good shepherd Jesus, keep the hellish enemy from snatching out  of  your                     loving hands this little sheep who belongs   to   you  only,  because  you are the                     Father of the orphans. I am an unworthy minister, but I beg","you to save your little daughter from those who  are  trying to pick her up.  They                     have a mind  to  lead  her through an unsound education.                          Most  holy Virgin,  I beg you to enlighten me on what I have to do for the                     salvation of this little orphan.  Please  enlighten those who are treating this affair;                     help us to succeed.                          My  dear  Saint Joseph,  deign to calm the spirits  of  this orphan's relatives,                     especially  N.  N.,  giving  her  the  holy  fear  of  God.    May    she    leave  the  little                     orphan in the  Retreat.  I  also commend her remnant relatives;  see to it that they                     agree with us for  the good of this little orphan,  if Jesus wants it (Vol.  6, pages                     l45-l46).                           To  succeed,  the  Father  combined  prayer  and  action.  He  set  up  a    more                     reasonable  council  of  family,    and  obtained  to    have    the  child    until    her                     complete education.  When  her  education  was complete,  their relatives called                     her  to  Argentina.    She  wrote  to  the    Father  narrating  how  she  broke  with  her                     sister who  expelled her from the house.  The Father wrote,  \"Poor daughter,  how                     many troubles you passed through! I foresaw everything because I  know society                     and  what it means to have relatives without  religious education!\" He points out,                     \"I bless the troubles I underwent for your  salvation  and  what  I  suffered  in                     dealing  with   your relatives.  Now you are in a condition to appreciate the good                     you have  received from this institute,  and you appreciate  it.  The most holy           564                     Virgin loved you so much.  Now, you never stop thanking her, and be faithful to                     a so loving mother and to her son, Jesus, our supreme goodness\" (Vol.  42,  page                     58). Then he counseled her on how to behave in her job.                        3. ...Rich in Goodness                              The  Father  calls  our full attention on  the  natural  and supernatural  reasons                     which should inspire us  while  practicing this most holy work.                           Rescuing an orphan from a deadly future along with providing him","a spiritual and temporal well-being is such a redemption that it  does not end with                     the  individual  orphan,    but  continues    from  generation  to  generation,  bringing                     about innumerable goods!                          A  male  and a female educated  orphan  who  succeed,   will convey their                     education and morals in the midst of society through their  example as well as by                     becoming parents of  children.  They will  share  with  them the teaching of faith                     and  civilization, practice  of  piety  and  training they  received  in  the  pious                     institute, where they grew up for God and their happy future.                          Those  who  strive diligently for the  salvation  of  tender children,  in  whom                     they awaken the smile of love;  who eliminate tears  and desperation, deserve a                     great reward...                          Let  us  conclude  by  considering  how  great  and    immense  is  the  priceless                     reward  that  our  Lord  Jesus  Christ  will  give  the    lovely  brides    who  are                     completely committed to this holy  mission.  They will  be rewarded during their                     life,  at death,  and after-death, because  their  mission rejoices forever the most                     holy  Heart  of Jesus,  the holy Church on earth, the heavenly court in paradise,                     the  angels,  the  saints,  and especially the great mother  Mary (Vol. l, pages 239-                     40).                          We would say that no work is so appreciated and pleasing  to the most holy                     Heart of Jesus as the education of little children. In  this case,  our Lord will not                     cry out with uttermost  anguish the  utterance  of the Holy Scripture,  'What do                     you gain  by  my blood?'  (Ps.  30,  9)  as he does at the sight of the  frightful        565                     abuse  the world commits against childish souls and at the  sight of their unhappy                     life or eternal loss.  On the contrary,  at  the sight  of  the  holiest mission aiming                     at saving  the  abandoned, derelict orphans  as well as at the sight of its good                     results, our Lord Jesus Christ will exclaim,  'What a gain by my blood!' These                     and  the  future  souls are brought to my Heart  by  my  faithful ministers and my                     faithful spouses! Blessed be the blood I shed in the midst of terrible suffering for                     the salvation of souls!\"                          Everyone  knows  how much the child Jesus suffered  for  the babies  the                     impious Herod slaughtered when Joseph and  Mary  took him  to  Egypt.  He saw                     those babies slaughtered and  drowned  in their  blood,  felt their poor mothers'                     torment and cries in  his most sensitive Heart. He experienced that horrible scene                     as if it were  the  occurring in his sweetest Heart as well as the  sword-points  and                     the saber cuts piercing his own Heart! And  yet,  he was  consoled by the thought                     that the babies who were slaughtered in  his place would be glorified in heaven.                          But  the most holy Heart of Jesus suffered even more when he foresaw the                     numberless tender souls,  who deprived of parents and of  an  opportunity  to be                     educated to a  good  life  by  zealous persons,  would  be left open to the spiritual                     slaughter which is caused by sin.                          This unheard slaughter has happened millions and millions of times ever since                     the world began!  My daughters in Jesus  Christ, if  you took care of yourselves                     only,  you would run the risk  of eternal  loss.  \"Let us","not hold our own soul more precious  than the souls of our brothers\" (Act.  20,                     24). Let us take the utmost care  of  the abandoned orphans.  But because this                     involves  the education of childish,  young souls,  we must expand our zeal not                     only  to  the abandoned orphans,  but also to the  tender,  young souls who come                     into  our  ministry,    either  in  the  kindergarten,  or  in    day-schools,    or  in  the                     orphanages.  These  institutions  are concerned  with  the  salvation  of  present                     and  future  souls, pleasing  the most holy Heart of Jesus just as the orphanages                     do (Vol. l, pages 239-240).                        4. Among his children                         Let  us  glance  at the Father staying in the midst  of  his children.                           Avignone Quarter:  the boys are in the laboratories. Brother Louis  is  walking                     in  the  courtyard  arm-in-arm  with  Brother Mariano,  who is already blind.  The                     little boys exempt from work are  whimpering  for some of their squabbles at the                     foot  of  the gigantic   eucalyptus  standing  out  and  perfuming  the  place.                     Suddenly,   the  Father  enters  the courtyard  wearing  hat  and outstretched cape,      566                     which increases the majesty of his noble gait. The boys burst out,  'The padre!                     The padre!'  They hasten to  him happily,  clapping hands.  The Father smiles,                     opens the cape, and the kids are under it, gladly. 'Let us walk so! Let us walk so!,'                     says   the  Father.   With  measured  steps  they  go  round  the courtyard...  It's                     both reality and symbol\" (Father Tusino, Conferenze pedagogiche e formative,                     page 83).                           Under  the  shadow of his anxious and  generous  Fatherhood, full of love and                     martyrdom,   the Father protected, defended, and guided his children in the way                     of life. Writes  Father Vitale,                           By  gathering abandoned children he meant to save them  from corruption;                     moreover, he watched over them like a  mother watches over her  children.  He                     infused  feelings  of  intimate  piety  and  fear  of  God  in  their  tender  souls;    he                     himself taught catechism in his own very effective way to make them love virtue                     and hate vice.","How many cares and industries he conceived of to prepare them for their                     first communion, and with how much fervor he made them receive Jesus more                     often!  For them he  wrote  particular preparations  and  thanksgiving;  for them,                     he  made  delightful speeches     before mass;  for them,  he formed societies of                     piety, such as the \"Luigini of Immaculate  Mary.\"  Gory  stories of witches and                     magicians  were  not  to  his  liking  because  these  stories    bring  fear  and  terror                     making  children  sometimes  grow  shy,    afraid,    and  superstitious.    His    rules                     about their education are  jewels  of practice  for  the  immediate  superiors  and                     assistants\"  (FatherFather  Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 325).                          How  delighted he was when children called him \"Padre!\"  The community                     priests were referred to by their names;  'Padre'  was for our founder alone.                          When  he returned after an absence,  and  kneeling  children said: \"Bless us                     Padre,\" his eyes shone with happiness.                          During  playtime  he was often among boys or girls to      cheer them  up  by                     being  comic,  telling  anecdotes  or  engaging  in pleasantries  aimed at moral                     teachings.  Then he would let them play youthfully and joyously (Father Mary                     Hannibal Di  Francia,  pages 338-39).                           For him, the little orphans were little Christs, and he had the honor to accept                     some of their food from their spoons to make up his dish.  Writes Father Vitale,                     \"Now and then,  as though he liked  living  their  way,  he  entered the  refectory                     and  said affectionately,  'Won't you give anything to your Padre, who is a poor          567                     man?'   Children presented their plates.  He  picked  up  a spoonful here and there                     and ate among the children, much to their satisfaction\"  (Father Mary  Hannibal                     Di Francia,  page 339).                          A former female orphan reports, \"One day the Father made the proposal  of                     making a trip in the Holy  Spirit's  garden.  At  a certain place,  he made us have                     a seat. Some children  distributed bread;  the Father, cheese.  When he reached                     me, I was told: 'Hold a piece more.' At the end of the distribution he came again                     to me and said, 'Please give me a bit of cheese'.\"                          Sometimes  he  was childish.  In Oria,  the good sisters  of Saint  Benedict                     gave  us baked chestnuts.  The  Servant  of  God fingered them,  and found that                     they were hard.  He prohibited the tasteful  snack for fear we could harm our                     teeth.  He caused  the chestnuts to be soaked, and replaced them with biscuits.                           Once he happened to see a child with a piece of almond candy in her mouth;                     quickly,  he took it away and warned the assistant about possible danger, adding:                     \"When  you  give  almond  to  children,  you    have  to  first  crush  it.\"  The  more                     children  were    little,    or  suffering,    the  more  he  loved  them.    Knowing  how                     severe the padre was  with  people dozing during services,  the sisters  tried  to                     awaken  small  children sleeping in the","chapel.  When  the  padre noticed this,  he said to the sisters:  \"Do not touch                     them;  let these innocent creatures sleep at the foot of Jesus;  he delights in it.                     However, it is a different matter with the older ones who are aware of how to                     respect the Lord.\"                          At    the  Taormina  orphanage  he  met  a  little  child  crying    and  screaming,                     inconsolably.  He  felt  compassion  and  shed  tears himself.  When he asked a                     sister what was wrong,  she said,  \"She does not want milk.\"                          \"O my daughter, she does not want it because she dislikes it; leave  it to me.                     Why do you make her cry this way?\" He took  the girl  by  the hand and led her                     to his room.  With a sad voice he repeated over and over: \"My poor daughter,                     they have grieved you; they have made you cry; you are only three years old.\"                     (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, pages 337-338).                           He  had a delicate,  gentle feeling of Fatherhood  with  the orphans.  One day,                     a little girl asked, \"Padre, water!\" He rushed to his room and brought a glass of                     water, helping the girl drink. The sister tried to replace the Father,  who said,                     \"Please do not intervene when the orphans appeal to me as a Father,  as I try to                     be  for  them.    You  cannot  imagine  my  joy  in  these  cases.\"  The  same  sister                     remembers that the Father was allergic to lemons  (it  is  strange  for a Sicilian).                     He was given goose-flesh from touching and even more from peeling them. And                     yet, to mortify and overcome himself,  at  Taormina  he peeled and sliced the                     lemons  for  the orphans  who liked having them from the Father.  I perceived             568                     the Father's sacrifice and prohibited the girls to ask or to  receive lemons from                     the Servant of God. When the Father knew the fact, he told  me,  \"Why do you                     deprive me of this occasion which helps me to win myself?\"                       5. With queer chaps...                              A former orphan who became a sister narrates,  \"It was three  years since I                     entered the  orphanage together with  my  sister.  At age of ten she became so                     ummanageable as to bite not only me, but also the mother superior and the padre;                     and yet, she was educated by the sisters.","One day the Father called her, said a prayer, and sprinkled her with water from a                     bottle:  she changed immediately. From  then on,  the Father called me 'the sister                     of the  baptized one.' I know he did the same with someone else.\"                          We  quote  from  Father  Vitale.                           \"One evening, the padre appeared in Oria with five children; he sent the two                     girls to the sisters of Saint Benedict;  while he sent the three boys to the prefect                     of our community.                          The prefect said: 'padre, we have no vacancy.'                          'We must;  I have delivered them from protestants who  wreak havoc in their                     city.'                          'Padre,  would  you  mind  explaining how and where  we  can accomodate                     them?'                          'No, no, it is up to you; the children must be saved.'                          When the padre behaved resolutely,  it was through trust  in God and he got                     what he asked for.  The children remained at Saint Paschal,  but as time passed,                     one  of  them  began  showing  symptoms  of  cleptomania.    When  unseen,    he                     pilfered everything:  keys,  an iron,  handkerchiefs,  and socks, concealing them                     in the pockets, sleeves, his vest, etc. He went to bed with something in his fist he                     had  taken.  It  dropped  out  of  his  hand  when  he  fell  asleep.  One  morning,  an                     assistant  could  not  find  his  shoes.  The  little  maniac  had  thrown  them  in  the   569                     bathroom.  Another day,  about 20 blankets disappeared.  They were concealed                     behind an altar in the  church. But he was reluctant to steal money and food.  He                     was tested, but he never did.                          It was a serious matter.  Neither mildness, nor warning, nor punishment,  nor                     threat of expulsion worked.  Because he had  no parents, his grandmother was                     told that the boy should be returned to her.  The poor woman answered that such                     a vice was hereditary, coming from both a grandFather and his Father who was                     continually in jail for robbery.  Advised by some people,      the poor old woman                     sent in a request to intern the boy in a house of correction  and mailed  it to the                     superiors of the orphanage to see that this  be done.                          In  the  meantime,    the  padre  was  in  Oria.    Informed  in  detail  about    this                     problem  as  well as about the  uselessness  of  any attempts  at remedy,  at first                     he thought there was no  solution. But  when he began reading the request,  he                     turned  pale  and    said  'This    is  a  death  sentence;    the  boy  will  dwell  among                     criminals. The terror of jail will overwhelm his fear of God.  No one  knows how                     the boy will react to the strictness of those laws;  he  may become lost!...'","But what could we do?                          The  padre recognized the need of the houses of  correction. He thought and                     said: 'We'll talk about this tomorrow.'                          People    understood  that  he  was  going  to  pray  before  deciding  about  the                     spiritual life of the boy.  He had taken the child away from worldly perils;  he                     wanted  to  keep  him  in  the  heart  of  Jesus  with  the  other  orphans;  he  lacked                     courage to send him away.                          The padre may have spent the day and night praying and doing penance.                          The next day,  he explained a bright plan as a last  resort. The  word  'thief'  in                     capital letters would be attached  to  the collar  of  the young cleptomaniac.  He                     had to  wear  this  label everywhere,  except  in  the church.  He would be told                     that    the  label    would    be  removed  after  he  mended  his  ways.    The  boy    felt                     crushed  by  shame.  Slowly,  he  learned  to  restrain  himself, correcting his                     problem.    He  remained  in  the  community  much  to  the  padre's  satisfaction\"                     (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, pages 329-30).                           Mary Salmeri,  a former orphan who remained in the institute as a daughter of                     the house and died at Saint Benedict in March of l972  at  the age of about ninety                     remembers,    \"So    many    times    I  informed  the  padre  that  I  had  vocation  any                     longer,  and he always listened to me  patiently helping me to win out temptation.                     Once I  wrote  a letter to him.  Later,  when I approached  him  again insisting                     that  I  had  no  vocation,    he  showed  what  I  had  written:  that  my  insisting  on   570                     leaving the religious life was a  temptation of the devil. From then on such a                     temptation disappeared.\"                       6. The heart he had                              \"To avoid stomach ache to the orphans, the Father used to taste the food to                     check whether it was cooked well. He told us to give them cookies seldom, but                     when he had some, he reserved all of them for the orphans.\" One year, at carnival                     time the Father was given some","sweets while staying at the Holy Spirit.  He sent them  to  Avignone  Quarter                     with this card,  \"They  are  for  the orphans only;  the aspirants will remember                     that this is a time of atonement   and  penance.\"  \"Someone  devoted  to  Saint                     Anthony promised  to cater a dinner for the orphans.  The padre  accepted the                     offer on the condition that he could taste the food before it was served.  He found                     it a little under cooked and sent it to the kitchen to be cooked longer\" (Father                     Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 338).  Also the best fruit was for the orphans.                     \"He told me to pick up some good figs, but when I offered them to him, he ate                     none,  but gave them all to the orphans.\" \"One evening, the padre heard a young                     female orphan crying; she had arrived that same day at  the Messina orphanage.                     He sent for her,  and while caressing her  paternally,  he told the sister to bring                     some fruit  to  the girl.  When  the sister came back,  he was not satisfied,...  and                     said seriously:  'Where is the fruit that was on this table?  Did you  save  it  for                     me?' The sister understood  and  brought  that piece.  The padre said:  'Now it is                     all right;  this is for  this girl,  not for me.' He peeled it and gave it to the child,                     piece by piece\" (FatherFather  Mary Hannibal Di Francia,  page 336).  When the                     first  fruits were not enough for the whole community,  they were given to the                     orphans only.                          He  wanted the assistants to provide abundant bread  on  the tables,  and said,                     \"Sometimes the boys do not ask for it, because they may be ashamed.\"                          \"Usually,    the    Servant  of  God  wanted  good  and  abundant  food  for  his                     communities.  Sometimes Father Vitale amazed at that, but the  Servant of God's           571                     expeditious answer kept  him  silent,  \"Oh, come now!...Father Vitale, the boys                     eat heartily and by two jumps digest everything quickly.\"                          Due  to  reasons  of  saving,  Father  Vitale  replaced  the  brother  in  charge  of                     victuals with another one. As soon as the Servant of God  realized that course                     and fruit were not abundant as  before, he ordered to return to the first appointee,                     Brother Placid, who was  generous.\"  \"The  Servant of God did  not  suffer  that                     the orphans were punished for long; therefore, when he saw someone of them in                     a corner, he went toward, questioned, and disposed him to beg  pardon in order to                     be delivered from  punishment.  Then,  to guarantee  authority,   the  Father  took                     information  from  the assistant  prefect  to  know if the boy had behaved.\"  I  do                     not  remember    whether    he  threatened  anyone  with    expulsion.    To    the                     mischievous  boys  he used to say,  \"Pay attention! The Lord  may punish  you.\"                     The  best  boys were  awarded  with  booklets  and rosaries.","\"On another occasion,  the padre wanted the Taormina orphans to spend a day-                     off at Giardini.  At dinner,  the padre waited  on them.  When  he realized there                     were not enough glasses,  he asked the superior: 'Why is there a lack of glasses?'                          She answered: 'The house is poor.'                          'Come  with me,' he said.  When they reached  the  cupboard, they  found                     crystal glasses,  large and small.  The padre picked them up joyously and said:                     'The orphans are more entitled to use them than the aristocratic ladies.' That was                     a glorious day for the girls\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 338).                          One  more gentle episode.                           \"The  Servant of God had promised the hooks to the  Taormina orphans to                     fish at the Giardini sea,  and he himself  accompanied the orphans.  I was the                     superior. Four boats were chartered. What inexpressible  joy for the Father and                     the orphans every time they caught  a little fish! At the end of their  fishing,  the                     Father bought  about twelve pounds of fish,  and asked the children  how they                     liked them cooked.  Each one showed her personal taste. Back home, despite my                     tiredness and the cook's mumbling, helped by the older  among  the orphans  I                     cooked  the  fish    according    to    each  one's  taste.  The  feast  was  great,  the  joy                     inexpressible. When the Servant  of God returned after a few days,  he asked me                     if I  had cooked  as he had said.  'Yes,  Father,' I responded.  'Good,' he said,                     'they    call  us  Father  and  mother  and  we  must  be    as    such.  These  are                     circumstances that impress feelings of gratitude toward the Lord on the orphans,          572                     and urge them to obey'.\"                           \"Two  of  the orphans who didn't have parents or  relatives, complained  that                     no one ever called upon them.  As soon  as  the padre  knew about this,  he said:                     'the poor daughters,   we  must console them!' He picked up two packets with                     candy and an  Easter lamb inside,  addressed them, and told the sister to deliver                     them to  the  orphans on Easter,  saying that they were sent by  their Father.                          The girls' hearts beat with joy and surprise:  'Do we have a Father?!'                          In  the afternoon,  he told the sister to send the girls  to the  parlor because                     their Father was waiting.  Both confused and joyous, the orphans hastened to the                     parlor, opened the door, and they met the padre standing, smiling, and saying:                     'Here I am;","am I  not  your  Father?'  Touched by  the  exquisite  kindness  and delicate  heart                     of the man who was more than a Father,  the girls could  not  help crying\" (Father                     Mary Hannibal Di  Francia,  page 339).                           \"On another occasion,  seeing a little orphan looking  pale, he asked: 'How are                     you feeling?'                          'Padre,' she said,  'during the night I cannot sleep because of the mosquitos.'                          Immediately,  he  sent for the superior and told  her:  'The mosquito net that                     you have prepared for my bed shall be placed at the girl's bed.  Also be solicitous                     and get information about the girl's  health.  The smallest one of the orphans is                     more  worthy than  both the starter and the mother general.\" In the evening he                     asked   me  if  I  had  prepared  everything,   and  renewed  his exhortations with                     the same words.  When this orphan,  by the name Papale,  got  married,  her                     house was struck  by  lightning.  The Servant  of God told us to furnish her with                     linen,  he gave  some money, and disposed a monthly help.                           The  Father  preferred  a fourteen year orphan  Falanga   of Taormina because                     she was half-wit.  Every time he went  over,  he sought and gave her a place of                     honor, making her sit on his side. One  day we rushed to welcome the Father's                     coming,  but the  poor Falanga fell down breaking a leg. The Servant of God was                     grieved, sent  for  doctors  and  medicine,   had  her  taken  to  senator Durante(2)                     who  was  spending his holidays at  his  native  town Letoianni,  and then took           573                     her  to  Messina.  She  recovered  after  six  months,  because  the  first  plaster  was                     faulty.  Finally  the  Servant  of  God  became  calm;  for  six  months  he  had  been                     restless,  asking us  continuously detailed information about the orphan's  health.                     One day he told me, \"Even though a half-wit, she is a creature of God,  and you                     have to treat her as a privileged one.\" \"Every time he came over,  he repeated the                     same exhortations, 'You must be as mothers with your orphans.  A mother looks                     after her daughters to see if they are pale,  if they eat, if they sleep; if they don't,                     she asks why. Do the same yourselves.' He himself set the example and  said,                     'Woe  to you who often undertake this  responsibility thoughtlessly'.\"                           Treating  how  the  Father behaved with  the  sick  orphans, Father  Vitale                     writes,                           \"Describing  his solicitous care for the sick is  difficult. Assistants  and sisters                     who took care of them had to explain  the daily  and  nightly  treatments in detail.                     Because he disliked entrusting the convalescing needy to strangers, as soon as he                     was able, he","bought two country houses, one for the boys, another one for the girls;  these                     houses were also suitable for special cases of the sick\" (Father  Mary Hannibal                     Di Francia, page 338).                           We  report  a  strange  episode about  a  mother  superior's behavior.  It taught                     a good lesson from the Father.  \"The  mother superior  of  the orphanage of Trani                     told the orphans  that  they needed  her  permission to go and eat at refectory                     when the  bell rang the meal time.  When the Father happened to be in Trani, the                     orphans asked him for such a permission.  He was amazed at  that, and  repealed                     such use.  Then he addressed the mother  superior, 'It  is strange;  it is you that                     should ask the orphans  for  the permission to eat;  in fact,  if the orphans were                     not,  would you stay here?' This simple, but deep thought touched all of us.\"                        7. His name day in l923                             We touch upon the Father's name day for two pieces of poetry he wrote to the                     orphans of Trani.                          In  the performance for the name of the Virgin Mary,  a  few orphaned girls          574                     declaimed some verses to  the Father. He was given these verses. To reciprocate,                     he wrote as many verses in the same meter and rhyme.                          He   addressed  the  first  piece  of  poetry  to  Josephine Loiodice.                                If I had virtues like flowers,                               Painted with loving color,                               Gentle counsels like the Father's                               I would give you, as a donor.                                My daughter, I would hand them to you,                               To make you love Jesus with live affection;                               Now I pray to Jesus for you                               To receive a good reception.                               May you be the gift he embraces                               Smiling with many graces.","Never is winter, nor flower-bed is dry                               For those who care to love Jesus;                               Neither nature, nor minds die                               But for Jesus they find the accent                               You will also say fervent                               On my behalf.                                Daughter, gather my words                               Into your heart, where less than ever                               The ray animator be lost:                               It's love for God, Jesus, and the Holy Ghost!                                         (Vol. 42, page 2).                           Then he responds to the other orphans,  exhorting and giving his verses.  \"I                     remember the day you celebrated my name day. I am very  happy  for your calm                     and obedience...   Be  always  docile, obedient,  and devout,  so our Lord and the                     most holy Virgin will protect  you in life and death...  Consider that we have to                     die, because  death is for every one;  that after death we'll face  an eternal reward                     or  an  eternal  punishment!  Say  your  prayer  devoutly  and    receive    holy                     Communion with a good  preparation.  Pray  the beautiful novena to Immaculate                     Mary to prepare yourselves for her feast; she will give you her graces.\"                          These are the verses:                                                                575                                Daughters blessed by Jesus' Heart                               The Father carries you in his heart,                                And prays that you have God's fear                               So that you may be always dear.                                He prays so: - Jesus, may it be true                               That these daughters grow in virtue,                                Like pretty and white lilies                               Far from the world and the sprees.                                May they have a good result                               And in eternal life exult.                                Immaculate Mary, our pioneer,                               Keep them in the celestial sphere.                                              (Vol. 34, page l85)","8. Admittance                              Let us see the teaching of the Father as an educator.(3)  He had begun the                     institution in the midst of the Avignone poor,  who were  absolutely in need of                     help;  therefore,  the  indispensable requisite  to  be  admitted  in his institution                     was  poverty  or abandon. These were the valid titles for the Father's charity.                          \"No  one is more exposed to perils and depravation than  the poor orphaned,                     or stray and wandering girls; therefore, they are more needy of help\" (S.C.  Vol.                     5,  page l55).  Of course, their admittance  to  the institution  was  free.  \"Usually,                     you  will receive  the more abandoned and poor orphans without pretending a                     monthly    tuition.    It  would  be  a  grave  fault  if  the  poor    orphans  were  denied                     admittance because they are unable to pay.\"                          The Father agrees that relatives or benefactors provide  the orphan with a bed                     and a child's outfit, but \"at the end, whatever the  results may be,  the orphan will                     be received in the name  of God, whose creature he is\" (Vol. l, page 245).                          While  in Padua in l907,  the Father was glad to receive  an orphaned girl,                     and  wrote  to  Father  Palma,    \"She  is  a  little  girl  somehow  sick,    half-wit,                     barefoot,  and abandoned! She will be a gift very pleasant to our Saint!\" (Vol. 30,                     page 24).                          We  report a significant episode.  The maid of Count Dentice of  Frasso was a        576                     widow.  She came to the Father with a letter  of recommendation  from the count                     to shelter her child.  The  Father responded,  \"This  is  not an abandoned child;                     he is  under  the protection  of the count,  who can send him to another  institute                     with a monthly tuition. Thus, he seizes the occasion to do a good work for his                     soul, and we save a vacancy for an abandoned orphan.\"  In circumstances such as                     this, the Father recommended","prudence and  firmness,  finding  out good grounds  for  denying acceptance,                     with great tact.                          Another    condition    about    the    little    girls.      The    Father  preferred    the                     motherless ones.  In the Father's way of  thinking the  orphans should remain in                     the institute until the age of  l8-20,  or  better  yet,  until their coming of  age.                     The  mothers, however,  often took their girls home for cheap excuses, baffling                     the Father's efforts of education.                          Memoirs    of  our  Pious  Institution  by  Father    Santoro,    after  narrating  the                     orphanage's  deterioration  because  the  mothers    took  home  their  daughters,                     reports  the  following    declarations  of  the  Father:    \"Since  then,  he  began                     understanding that we should avoid sheltering  fatherless girls;  in fact,  he had                     always  or    almost  always    to    suffer    because  of  their    mothers'    behavior.                     Common  people    with    no    understanding    of  the    duty    to    educate    their                     daughters,   took them home when someone said to them,  'They  ill-treat  your                     daughter'.\" And the police sent for the Father several times.  Perceiving by innate                     or acquired malice the Father's care to  save their daughters,  they took advantage                     and  sponged  off  of  him.    For    instance,    we  are  reminded  of  how  a  mother                     introduced  herself  to  the  director,    shouting  in  her  determined    vernacular,                     'Comu! I genti mi mancianu a facci dicennu: aviti na figghia dda' intra, e nun vi                     dugnanu nenti!' (people eat my face alive saying, you  sent  your  daughter to the                     orphanage,  and  they  give  you nothing!) (Bulletin, January-April l927, page                     202).                                                                                     577                          In a letter to the mayor of Oria,  while  treating the  case of two girls who had                     been  taken  home,  the  Father  recalls  the  rule  \"to    never    receive    fatherless                     children who have  their  mother, because a long experience,  which never fails,                     convinced me that due to female inconstancy and natural,  unruled  sensitivity,                     the mothers today shelter their daughters with great enthusiasm,  and tomorrow                     they  take  them  home.\"  He  vindicates  himself  by    saying,  \"Who  authorizes  a                     mother to exploit my institute by sheltering  a child arbitrarily\" (Vol. 4l, page                     l06).                          However,    this  is  not  an  absolute  rule.    In  fact,  the  Father  writes,    \"Rare,                     particular    cases    require    that  we    receive    by  prudence  the  fatherless  child                     having her mother\"  (Vol.  l,  page 24l). To tell the truth, the Father often left out                     this rule; his heart  did not allow him to deny a shelter to pitiful children... Who                     knows how many of them he received?                          Age is another limit to the admittance of the orphans.  They must be five to                     seven years old, because the Father wants them","innocent  in  order  to  form  a  pure  environment.    He  writes,  \"Taking  parentless                     children  of  little  age it  is  ideal  to  form  an orphanage model. The sisters can                     also receive little girls of two years  of age,  but not many of them because they                     would give much trouble.  To educate the orphans step by step,  the acceptance                     of children at the opening of an orphanage should be  gradual.  When the little                     orphans are well educated in piety and work, then even good girls of about ten                     years can be accepted,  because they will conform  to  the  good ambient and                     well-going  of    the    community\"  (Vol.    l,    page    24l).    The  Father  was  easy-                     accomodating    to    the  orphans'age  because  he  did  not  resist  his  impulse  of                     charity, but he left some limits to us by rule, especially about age.                          The  fourteen Rosary Scimone of Taormina is a typical  case.      A  fourteen                     year old orphaned  girl from Taormina worked  as  a scullion  in various houses                     to earn her living.  Beaten and fired because she pilfered, she went from bad to                     worse in other houses. Dispersed,  ragged,  hair topsy-turvy,  and morally upset                     she was wearisome to herself and others, having no hope of a good future. One                     day she was drawing water at a fountain  when  a  foreigner passed by,   looked                     at her, and took a snapshot after letting her pose as a characteristic girl.                          In  the  photo she  appeared like an African  savage  woman, barefoot  and                     muddy,  her hair topsy-turvy,  the look on her face troubled;  on  the  whole,  she                     infused  a  feeling  of    horror    and  compassion,  because  she  was  an  orphan                     abandoned to herself in the bloom  of her youth.  That photo appeared in some                     post-cards  of Taormina.                                                                  578                          Some  days  later,    pious  people  asked  me  to  shelter  that  poor  orphan;    I                     received her along with her extreme poverty. The youth was trained in education                     and vocational work,  and at 2l years of age  she was already transformed:  no                     one could recognize her  as the girl in the foreigner's snapshot. When she left the                     institute to be hired by a noble family of Taormina,  we took a photo. What a                     difference  between the first photo and the  second  one!  The latter  shows the                     good education's miraculous effects!  The photo shows  a neatly dressed serene                     youth,  whose look transpires  the gentle  dignity  of a calm soul that is  born                     again,  that  looks forward  to the future with confident trust.  She is handling  an                     opened book,  which signifies morals, dignity, and culture. Where is the African                     savage woman,  whose gloomy look disheartened  and distressed?  The African                     savage woman disappeared not through","the  blizzards  of  life,    but  through  the  beneficial,  enlivening  ray  of  the  civil,                     moral, and intellectual education! (S.C. Vol. 5, pages l57-58).                        9. Religious education                              What was the Father's aim in the education of his youth?                          He aimed at leading his children to their last end,  as  the magisterium  of  the                     Church teaches authoritatively.  \"It  is  of greatest  importance not to be mistaken                     both in education and  in the direction toward the last end, because education and                     last end are  intimately connected.  In fact,  since education consists in forming                     the  human  being  as it must  be  and  behave  in  this terrestrial  life in order to                     reach its last end for which it was created,  it is obvious... that we have no true                     education when it does not aim at the last end (Pious XI,  Encyclical Divini illius                     Magistri, December 3l, l929). The Father said the same thing in a different way                     in l890, at the end of the rules for the orphans.                           Please train the orphans in discipline and work, since they are children.  Later,                     they will be happy for that. Beginning from their tender age, they must be taught         579                     to comply with their  duty toward God, themselves, and their neighbor; by so                     doing, they are setting  out  on the right path toward their  eternal  salvation.                     Everything passes away, but since  the human being was created to be  eternal,                     each  Christian must always keep in mind  his  last goal, which is his eternal                     salvation (Vol. 2, page 73).                          Thirty years ago I began gathering, educating, and providing orphans  with a                     good future.  Ever since I have been holding  and experiencing  that  the  steady                     base  of  any    civil    education    is  religious    education!    I  have  learned    from                     experience,  reason, faith,  learned  people,  and common sense:  that to form a                     civil  human  being,    an  educated  good  citizen,  it  is  necessary  to  form  a  good                     Christian! (Vol. 45, page 469).                           Good  Christian   means  a  fervent,   practicing     Christian committed  to                     living  the vows of  his  baptism,  therefore  the Servant  of","God wanted both Religious and orphans to be saints, not simple Christians.  The                     Second Vatican Council has  reminded that  holiness  is not a privilege of a caste,                     or  of  a  social class, but it is a duty for all (L.G. no. 29).                          When  the Father insists upon the salvation of the  orphans, he means first the                     eternal salvation. He preached to the sisters, \"The world is full of souls who get                     lost:  snatch as many of them frometernal ruin as  you can.  Collect,  instruct,                     and feed  the abandoned  orphans.  Each soul you save will be a seed of eternal                     salvation for many others; all of them will beautify the crown of your  glory in                     heaven.\"  He wants the hearts of his daughters  to widen  out  as  to hug and save                     the  whole  world  through  their charity.  \"Long  for,  be  always  hungry  and                     thirsty  for  the salvation  of  the souls you cannot save with your work.  Be  not                     indifferent to the ruin of one soul,  because one soul is  worthy of  the  blood of                     Jesus Christ and is as precious as  all  souls\" (Vol. 45, page 398).                          How  warmly  he  begged us to see the image of God  in   the features  of                     children and the suffering,  and to  consider  that taking  care and helping them is                     like serving and thinking of God during  the  mass,  or  the meditation.  How he                     exhorted    us    to  beautify  the  human  creatures  with  education,    clearing  them                     from eventual faults. I still feel the grave, but kind warning he gave me  when I                     suddenly said of a boy,  \"how ugly he is!\" The  Father told me,  \"Please see the                     soul created by God,  not the body!\" So says one of our Religious.                                                                                                                580                     10. The educators the father wanted                            The  Father wanted the educators fully aware of their  tasks and  qualified for                     their  duties.    For  this  reason  he  sets  them  in  an  environment  stowed  with                     spirituality.                          \"Educating    children,    he  writes,    is  a  work    of    continuous  sacrifices                     requiring  great  self-denial:   one  must   undergo annoyance,  want,  boredom,                     difficulties.  Let us face and offer","everything to the adorable our Lord Jesus Christ\" (S.C.  Vol. l0, page  l97).  The                     sisters  \"will  work  and  suffer  everything  for  the  sake  of  Jesus,    supreme                     goodness... being loving souls. Love will make  them strong in their suffering,  in                     their  work,  in  their immolation\"  (Vol.  3,  page 77).  The Father attributes the                     good results  of  a formation house to the sacrifices  of  the  ruling staff.  \"Our                     community of Trani is a very blessing. The girls are ingenuous,  docile,  humble,                     and  laborious.  It depends on  the smart,  open, holy dedication of their master                     who works very hard day and night\" (Vol.  35,  page l34). Because the educator                     should be the living example for children,  the Father insists upon this subject  in                     the rules for the Rogationists and the Daughters  of Divine  Zeal.                           To    succeed    in    this  holy  enterprise  and  to    make    children  attain    good                     results,  we  have to edify them  by setting a good example  in  everything.  We                     must  keep  in  our  mind    the    terrible  threat  of  our  Lord  in  Mt.    l8,7:    \"What                     terrible things will come on the world through scandal!\" (S.C.  Vol.  l0,  page                     l97).  The sisters  and the assistants  will endeavor to radiate observance, piety,                     zeal,  charity,  union  of  hearts,  and holy  fervor  as examples  of  virtues  and                     holiness for the  edification  of  the orphans.  The sisters' action more than the                     words must  penetrate and edify the tender souls! (Vol.  l,  page 245).   First of                     all, the sisters will give good examples to the girls in speech,  love for work,                     religious  practices,    obedience,    mutual  respect,  etc.  avoiding    intimacy  and                     confidence  with  them.    Woe  if  they  induced  the  girls  to  speak  ill  or  refer  or   581                     exchange mutual gifts or  give secret  messages.  By doing so they would lose                     their own  dignity ruining  the girls.  The sisters are warmly exhorted to use  fine                     manners    and  civil  demeanor  according  to  the  principle  of  a  sound  education,                     because  the  true education is sister  to  the  true devotion (Vol. 2, page 9l).                           In those days, the novices were the assistants of the girls, and the Father wrote                     to them,                           To   train  the  children  to  be  docile,   obedient,   and disciplined  the  sister                     will give good  example.  She  will  arm herself  with  patience,  meekness,  and                     charity  talking  almost always  with gentle,  mild voice,  because such a behavior                     keeps  children  quiet  more  than  any  invective  or  hard  reprehension...    A  mild                     educator makes the pupils mild (Vol. 2, page 27). The Little Retreat novices will                     consider themselves like maidservants of the girls  and the poor,  especially of                     those who belong to the pious institute.  For  God's  glory,  the  most holy  Heart                     of  Jesus' consolation,  and the souls' sanctification the novices will give good                     examples to children,  edifying in everything  through  the exercise of virtues                     (Vol. 2, page 33).                          Children  follow  the  educator's  pattern;  their  behavior  depends  on  the                     educator's behavior; therefore, the prefect of the boys will be flawless","in morals and religion making it appear in his  actions,  gestures,  words as well                     as in his way of  acting, talking, and thinking (Vol. 3, page lll).                          As  little  as  they  may  be,    children  have  a  natural  power    of  perceiving  by                     intuition the goodness inherent in their superiors' behavior.  If  their  examples                     are bad  (which God  forbid!)  the children  by  intuition will form their own                     judgments  and  scorn what  they have been  taught.  As sound as the teachings                     by words may  be,   in  the  presence  of  actions  contradictory  to  the teachings,                     they fade away like smoke under the wind's force (Vol. l, page 246).(4)                          In  the  world,  the  ruin  of  souls  which  occurs  in  families  is  a  hecatomb.                     Education in the world has been defined,  \"The  most difficult  art entrusted to                     the most inexperienced hands.\" People act,  talk,  and speak in the presence of                     children as if they  do not  understand  what  has been said or done.  On  the                     contrary, children understand very much,  even if they are unawares of  it; in fact,                     babies learn to speak a language at about the age of two years (Vol. l, page 246).                           Another  duty of the educator is praying for the pupils.  By faith  we know                     that we can do nothing without the grace  of  God. The educators have to implore                     this grace to succeed in their                     task. Listen  to the Father.                           Because everything starts well with God, the sisters who are committed to the                     orphans'  direction,    education,  and  service  will  combine    good    example  with   582                     prayer in order to educate them in  a holy manner (Vol.  l, page 247). We have to                     pray every day to our Lord  Jesus  Christ and Immaculate Mary for our orphans                     so  that they may be docile,  profit by,  and grow in the holy fear of God (S.C.                     Vol.  l0, page l97). To succeed in everything, the prefect will  pray  to  the Lord                     for help and  enlightenment  every  day, because  educating the youths is the art                     of  the  arts  and    no    one  can    succeed  in  it  without  the  Lord's  help  and                     enlightenment!  He will  also  pray to the Lord and Our Lady every day so  that                     his pupils  may  succeed and save their souls  (Vol.  3,  page  ll2). Separately                     from  the orphans,(6) they will pray in  common  with zeal  and fervor every day                     at the assigned time so that our  Lord and  the  most  holy Virgin may give them                     enlightenment  in  the performance  of  their  duty toward the  orphans;  and  give                     the  orphans    docility    and    grace  to  cooperate    faithfully    with    the  sisters'                     instruction,  direction,  and motherly kindness (Vol. l, page 247).                           Besides  the  prayer in common,  the Father  recommends  the private prayer                     \"during the mass, the holy Communion, and in other circumstances during the                     day\" (Ibid.)","To make people understand well the necessity of prayer, the                     Father  insists on recalling the difficulties of  the  educators' work.                           It  was well stated by Saint John Chrysostom,  \"Education of children  is  the                     art of the arts;  no human  art,  painting  and sculpture  included,  can reach the                     merits of those  forming  the children's soul\" (Vol.  l,  page 246).  Educating                     children is the art  of arts,  the science of sciences,  and only a few have  it,                     because  one should be a philosopher and a theologian and a great expert of the                     human heart and a saint to be a perfect educator of a  child.  As for us,  let us do                     our best by work and  prayer  to Jesus  and  Mary,  imploring  enlightenment                     about  education  of children (S.C. Vol. l0, page l98).                          An    episode  regarding  the  first  orphan  of  the  house  in  Rome,  in  l925,  is                     typical. It gave the Father the opportunity to insist on the necessity of prayer in                     the education of children. I do not know  what the child had done,  but the sisters                     presented him  to the Father in order to beg pardon.  The child,  however,  was                     not shaken;  instead,  he remained stiff, cold, and staring defiantly as  much as                     his five years allowed him.  The Father  wrote,  \"The sisters  presented him to me                     to beg pardon:  he stood  before  me like  a  fish  saying  no word despite  the                     suggestion  and  the insistence  of  the sister.  He did not seem to  be  wrong.\"                     The Father concluded, \"Therefore, let us pray, because without divine grace  it is                     impossible to bend a human will,  not even that of a five year old child.\"                583                          However,    the    Father  does  not  want  the  difficulties  of    the  enterprise    to                     overcome the courage of his children.  \" And  yet, those  who  left  the  world to                     dedicate  themselves  to  God  in religion,  seeking  their sanctification,  are able                     to  lead  the tender souls toward a sound,  moral,  and civil education if they are                     helped by divine assistance and keep in mind the  importance of education, rules,                     and these exhortations\" (Vol. l, page 246).                          When a person works with a good will, divine grace helps her to  succeed.  He                     writes,  \"Thanks to the Lord,  these girls  are quiet,  and,  what matters more, the                     assistant is becoming a good educator.  She is pious,  prudent, meek, far-sighted,                     trusting in the  Lord and the most holy Virgin,  to whom she  recommends  her                     pupils warmly and daily. Some people happen to form themselves by forming the                     others\" (Vol. 3l, page 50).","11. Educational method                            To  educate  children,  the  Father follows  the  preventive method known as                     Don Bosco's method.   Don Bosco acknowledges that such a method is of old                     (see Braido, Il sistema preventivo di Don Bosco, page 34). It is known as Don                     Bosco's method because no one applied and spread it with such a perfection as                     Don Bosco did  to achieve  the best results.  The Father prescribes,  \"We point                     out again,  we must follow Don Bosco's system, the preventive method, which                     wards off children's faults by watching over them in such a way that they have no                     opportunity to commit faults.  Formed in  a Christian  spirit and devotion,  they                     will feel the holy fear  of God, and avoid committing serious faults\" (Vol. l, page                     266).                          The  secret of the good results of the preventive method  is good  assistance,                     or surveillance.  Don Bosco insists upon  this subject, and the Father as well.                           To  watch  over children is a strict precept and a  duty  of ours.  Directors  and                     assistants will keep a watch on them in the church,  in the laboratories, in the                     school, in play-time, and in the  dormitories  knowing that children have a keen                     instinct  to escape from surveillance;  therefore the educator must be smarter than                     they  are.    The  devil  seeks  depravity  of  children  constantly,  but    the    assistant                     must elude Satan's snares by  preserving  the children  immaculate,  for the sake         584                     of the Lord! (S.C.  Vol.  l0, page l98).                           For  the sisters:                           Continuous,  accurate surveillance is an important factor to keep the institute's                     orphans in perfect order. Watching over them is the master's, the vice-master's,                     and the assistant's duty, but the  major  responsibility is that  of  the  master.                     Continuous, accurate, and careful surveillance is the great preservative from any                     defect,  hence it is called the preventive method.   From the sisters' watchful care                     the orphans understand the","importance and the  aim  of surveillance,  and learn to accustom  themselves  to                     discipline and the practice of their duties.                          The  master,  either personally  or through the  vice-master, who should be                     fully  aware  of  his  high  mission  and  responsibility,  will  never  leave  children                     abandoned  to  themselves,  otherwise  they    quickly  and  inevitably  become                     negligent and inactive.  The sister who  oversees  the orphans must keep close                     vigilance  over  them, aware  of all of their actions and conversations  (Vol.  l,                     page 247).  Most watchful will be surveillance during  play-time.  The sister  will                     be  most  alert as she leads the  children  to  the recreational  area  annexed  to the                     institute  where  their  play activity will allow them to let off steam;  all of which                     improves  their      health,      as    well    as    their    physical      and      emotional                     development.  In  their  play  she  will  be  attentive  to  prevent  rough  and    rowdy                     actions,  which could result in harmful  injuries.  In order  that  good  habits  in                     working    and    playing    together    be  developed,      quarreling      and    poor                     sportsmanship  will  not  be tolerated.  No  one should separate them from the                     group,  either alone or in pairs,  but all  should be within  sight of the  person                     presiding (Vol. l, page 250).                           For the prefects:                           To perfectly fulfill his duty,  the prefect will watch  over the boys with careful                     attention.                          Surveillance  consists  in keeping guard  on  their  actions during  work,  prayer,    585                     and  especially  in  play-time  because  it  is  then  that  the  boys  try  to  escape  his                     supervision.  When the  boys are playing,  he will not be carefree,  but will supervise                     from a place whence he is able to see all of them;  if they are walking, he  will  be in                     their  midst  hearing  their  talk  even    though    they  speak  in  a  low  voice.    While                     playing,  he will let them cry aloud and jump at their liking,  but without laying                     hands  on  each  other  or    beating  or  insulting  the  fellows  or  damaging  the                     community's things or damaging their  clothes by falling down on the ground.                          During work time, he will watch over in the factories seeing that  the boys are not                     idle,  do not gossip nor play nor struggle against the boss.                          Also  in the Church he will be most  diligent,  helping  the boys enter composed                     and recollected.  To be of help, he will stop them at the church's entrance till they                     are calm and silent. Then he  will lead them,  recollected and reverent,  will sign                     himself with  the holy water,  and genuflect in the middle of the  aisle, teaching the                     boys to do the same while going to their place;  the vice  prefect will enter last.  The                     prefect will also see  to  it that  the  boys sit down or kneel at the proper  time as well                     as follow the liturgy, composed and silent, answering the prayer all together with a                     moderate voice.                          In  the refectory,  he will demand fine manners of the boys, and observance of                     silence.                          Personal  attention  will be given to each boy  that  he  be provided  with  clothes                     and footwear every week and  bed  sheets every other week.","The prefect will see to it that the boys  take care of their clothes, having them                     repaired  as soon as possible, and that they observe bodily neatness in the hands,                     face,  neck,  ears.   If  necessary, he  will  have the  boys wash themselves in his                     presence.                          The  boys are not allowed to do anything without  permission nor  to go to the                     parlor to talk with external persons nor to act as  door keepers.  While giving                     permissions  the  prefect  will    pay  careful  attention  to  prevent  two  boys  from                     meeting  alone  far  from  surveillance.    He    must    be  careful  because  boys  are                     skilled  in asking permissions which give them the chance to meet alone (Vol. 3,                     pages ll0-lll).                           The  accurate and continuous assistance of preventive method has  nothing to                     do with the methods of the  police,  because  its soul is love.                           For  God's  sake,   both  superior  and  teachers  will  be affectionate    and                     respectful  toward  the  orphaned  children, holding them as souls who are dearest                     to  the  Lord,  perhaps  dearer  than    themselves,    because  they  are  innocent  and                     poor.  In  their affectionate care of the orphans, the sisters will never make use of                     offensive or harsh words,  especially when dealing with  those marked  by anger                     and  impatience,    not  even  when  it  is  a  matter  of  correcting,  reproaching,  or                     punishing them.                          That the orphans  may develop the same virtues, the sisters' relationship with       586                     them must be marked by meekness,  charity,  and holy zeal as well as by a pinch                     of sternness,  which will prevent children from taking advantage of them or from                     becoming excessively familiar.  The sisters will beware of partiality,  because it                     can  be  detrimental  for  all:  instead  they  will  love  all  in  God  dealing  prudently                     with  all   in  order to  avoid  the  orphans'  taking advantage.  Such  treatment                     does  not  prevent  them  from    rewarding  the  best,    humble,  obedient,  and                     observant children (Vol. l, page 260).                           The prefect in the midst of children:                           He will show that he is warmly interested in their good, and the  boys  will be                     charmed by perceiving and   understanding  it. This is the education's real secret!                          When  the educator is really interested in the pupils' good, loves them in a                     holy manner,  and is concerned with their future, if  they do not succeed,  he can                     be strong enough to punish  them when they are at  fault,  and the pupils will                     never feel offended, on  the contrary they will love and fear their educator (Vol.                     3, page ll2).","The Father insists on the love topic:                           We must love children with pure,  holy affection,  with deep understanding of                     charity, tender, Fatherly charity in God because this is the secret of the secrets to                     win and save them.  We  have to  deal  with  affection and meekness as well as                     with  reserve, which  prevent  children  from intimacy  and  confidence  through                     reverential fear.  Children must never be insulted. If necessary, punishment  must                     be given in such a way that children know it  is for  their good.  Children must                     never be reproached  for  private faults in the presence of others,  especially the                     little ones who might  run  risks  of scandal.  In such a case,  the  warning  or                     punishment  must be in private.  The superior will  never  become vexed  with                     children  nor show a grudge or  lack  of  confidence against  them.  It  is better to                     conceal some faults  instead  of disheartening or making children grow weak.                          Punishments  or  strong warnings  must be avoided when  they may  provoke                     reactions;  it would be like destroying a  building. Because  each educator needs                     God's enlightenments,  he  will  ask them from the Lord and the mother of good                     counsel  every  day,  even  with  tears  and  internal  prayer  in  the  daily  occasions                     (S.C.  Vol. l0, page l98).                                                                                                                  587                     12. Educating the whole person                              Pius  XI  specifies  the  field  of  education,  which  \"regards  the  whole  person,                     individually and socially considered, according to nature  and grace.  We should                     never  lose  sight  of  the  subject  of  education,  i.e.,  the  whole  person,  spirit  and                     body,  along  with  his  natural  and  supernatural  faculties  as  we  know  him  from                     reason and revelation\" (Encyclical Divini Illius Magistri).                          Let  us begin from the body,  specifically from the care for health.                           \"In    dealing    with  children,    the  sisters    will    teach    them  hygiene    and                     cleanness,  both of which confer and preserve  their health,  while  the lack of                     hygienic  habits  deteriorate  their  own  health  and  endanger  that  of  others.  By                     receiving the orphans, the sisters  are  bound in duty not only to  educate  them                     procuring their  spiritual good,  but also to keep,  preserve,  and improve their                     bodily well-being\" (Vol.  l,  page 242).  \"While educating their minds and","hearts,    we  won't  leave  out  our  duty  of    taking  care  for  the  youths'  strong                     constitution\" (Vol. 43, page l4). And to the people's unwarranted charges that the                     Father did not  keep well his children, he responded, \"As to how we are taking                     care  of  the    orphans,    ladies    and  gentlemen,    please  come  to    check    for                     yourselves.    As  a  tutor,  I  somehow  know  my  duties.  It  is  not  only  with    the                     salvation of souls and religious education that  I  am concerned,  but I also take                     great care of my orphaned  children's bodily  health  and civil  education.  Good                     nutrition,    hygiene,  cleanness,    and    good  manners  are  main  factors  of  the                     educational system in my institutes.                          As  for  nutrition,  please  look at  children  to  see  how rubicund and healthy                     they are\" (Vol. 45, page 460). Then he talks about the food specifically.  It must                     be sound,  sufficient,  and various (cf. Vol. l, page 243).(5)                          Recreation is to be \"lively,  animated, in the open air. The sisters  will  pay                     diligent attention to the child's  complexion, knowing that a pallid  complexion                     and  the  lack  of  interest  in  play  activity  are  symptoms  of  illness,  fever  or                     indigestion; in such a case a remedy must be applied\" (Vol. l, page 243).                           In those times, when only quite a few workers were graduated                     from  elementary  schools,  the instruction of our  children  was confined to the                     elementary ones.                          The Father likes best our own teachers.  \"As to the  school, we  have to resort                     to  lay  teachers  only  when  it  is    indispensable  and  after  praying  and  gaining   588                     reliable information\" (Vol. l, page 25l).  We  have  to  exclude,  as much as we                     can,  the  outsider teachers in our elementary schools\" (Vol. 35, page 263).                          The    Father    held    the    theater  as    a    means    of    education.  Therefore,  he                     promoted  performances  in  his  institutes.  He  writes,  \"Besides  teaching  and                     educating the orphaned girls,  performances attract,  edify,  and  dispose  people                     to be  favorable  to  the institute and the orphans\" (Vol. l, page l64).","13. Educating to piety                              \"If  attentive  and motherly care of the orphans' health  is important,   more                     important  is  their  education  in  religious principles,  which  must be the basis                     of their education  and  of their temporal and eternal happiness\" (Vol.  l,  page                     25l).  The Father  says of the orphans,  \"They will be religious not only in the                     external practice of their duties,  but also in their  inner spiritual life,  always                     having the holy fear of God,  the  surest guide to success\" (Vol. 2, page 75).                           Therefore, it is necessary to form a Christian conscience in the child and in                     the youth, which \"consists in enlightening their minds about the will of Christ,                     his law,  and his life,  helping them to freely perform the divine will.  This is the                     highest  aim of education.\" So says Pius XII (March 23, l952).                          The   enlightenment   of   the   mind   requires   religious instruction. The                     Father was an apostle of teaching catechism, and prescribed  to teach it daily to                     children  \"according to the best methods to be complete and fecund\" (S.C.  Vol.                     l0, page l97). To foster  emulation,  he  encourages  the  giving  of  rewards  for                     catechistic  competitions,  and exhorts to properly  explain  the truths  of faith in                     such a way that the teaching of catechism  be not a pure exercise of memory.                                                                                                               589                          \"To  teach  Christian doctrine mechanically to  children  is nearly  useless.  To                     better  impress  the  mysteries  of  faith  in  the children's  tender  minds,    they  will                     vary the instruction  through careful  wording  of  the  catechism and   the  use  of                     lecture,  projecting    pictures    from  slides  and  explaining    the    truths    of  faith.                     Teaching  Christian  doctrine  to the orphans will  be  a matter  of  great  concern                     for    the    sisters,    who    will    devote  themselves    to  it  in  order  to  develop  the                     spiritual life  of  the orphans\" (Vol. l, page 253).                           If    human  will  is  not  fortified  against  the  snares  of    evil,  whose  roots  go                     deeply into our nature corrupted by original  sin, instruction  is not enough for a                     complete education.  The  Father calls  our full attention to this subject when he                     writes,  \"While educating  children we shouldn't make them do,  but will  to  do\"                     (Vol. l, page 266). Will is fortified \"by the supernatural truths and by the means                     of  grace  without  which  we  are  unable  to  overcome  our  bad  inclinations,  nor                     achieve moral perfection\" (Pius XI, Divini illius Magistri).  For this reason the                     Father insists on religious","education  through  the  practice  of  the  virtues,  penance,  retreats,    spiritual                     exercises,  and Pious Union, such as Luigini children of Immaculate Mary for the                     boys,  and Daughters of  Mary for the orphaned girls.  The Father is charged with                     making people say  many  prayers,  but this was the method of the educators  of                     those  times,  such  as  Don  Bosco,  who  stands  out  among  them.  Braido  says  of                     him, \"The environment of piety created by Don Bosco is so intense as to impress                     and amaze the outsiders\" (quoted work, page 28l). Now we remember  the holy                     suggestions aiming at \"instilling faith in the divine things,\" as the Father said.                     Besides talking of God,  Jesus Christ,  the Madonna, and the saints, they lift up                     the children's minds through the contemplation of nature.                           \"The  marvels  of creation such as the sun,  the  moon,  the stars,  the  fine                     days of spring,  the  fields,  the  trees,  the flowers, the food they eat, the water                     they drink are topics to be talked   about  frequently.   The  sisters  will  make                     children understand that all things are the work of God and everything has been                     created  for our good...   To succeed  in  everything,  the sisters  first must be                     deeply  convinced  of  the  holy  truths;    they  must  be  spiritual  souls  giving  holy                     examples\" (Vol. l, page 252).                                                                                                                  590                     14. Education to work                              The education of children is implemented by work, which is a main factor of                     education and a source of gain. The Father exposed his  ideas on this subject in a                     speech  when  a  committee  of  ladies  went  to  visit  his  orphanage  for  girls  in                     Messina.                            Ladies  and  gentlemen,   I  have  always  deemed  that  an institute for the                     education of children and youths cannot pretend to  keep going on alms only;  it                     would seem like a  strong   young person  who  would like living on begging                     instead of  working.  A charitable institution is allowed","to ask help within some bounds, only  when  the  inmates are unable to work                     such  as  the  blind, cripples,  feeble old persons,  or little children.  But  relying                     mainly   on alms to maintain an institute for youths  jeopardizes the educational                     system.                          The    youth  must  be  trained  in  a  salaried  work  from  the    time  of  their                     childhood.  For  an  institute  of  education,  work  is  a  main  factor  for  building                     morals because  it keeps  order,  discipline, life, and guarantees the future of the                     youth by teaching them how to  earn their living through the sweat of their brow                     (Vol.  45, page 44).                           The    Father  installed  several  laboratories  for  his  children:  typography,                     tailoring,    shoemaking,  carpentry,  machine-shop.  The  orphans  were  assigned                     \"according to their vocational   skills\" (God and Neighbor, l925, page ll). For the                     orphaned girls he set up a laboratory for embroidery in white,  silk, and gold, as                     well as crochet, pillow lace, spun gold, old fashion lace, and knitted goods.  To                     foster  emulation  among  the  children,  the  Father organized  the  award days,                     the exhibition of the works,  and  a sharing  in  the  profit  so  that at  their  going                     out  of  the institute,  the orphans could get their money\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page 80).                          Let  us see how the Father insisted on a certain work with a mother superior                     of another congregation.                           As  to  the  lace  goods,      I  cannot  accept  the  excuse  that    the  outside    girls    591                     dislike it,  etc.  It happens because you do  not know, or are unwilling to lead                     such a work. Teach at least two of the outside youth,  the most poor, telling them                     and their parents that  you are going to pay them;  as soon as they hand a work                     of theirs,  even ill made,  pay two or three liras for that in order to allure them.   I                     myself will pay.   If you continue doing  so, the  other youth will come to work.                     Recommend yourselves to  the most holy Virgin,  because prayer is needed for                     everything.  Lead the  orphans to this work and send their first embroidery good                     to me; I will buy it. I think that I have made myself understood! To get things                     going on well,  we must put up activities,  work,  and sacrifice, without trusting                     in alms only (Vol. 38, page 6).","15. Punishments                               Brother  Louis,  who  was  a prefect of the boys  for  forty years,  summarizes                     the  Father's thought  on  this  topic.  \"The servant of God appointed me to the                     office of prefect  of the boys in  l908.  He demanded absolute surveillance and                     understanding of the  juvenile soul,  which needs enlightenment.  He  disliked  to                     punish  children  shortly after their faults,   and suggested  to give some gift to                     the repented ones.\"                          Attentive  surveillance and the formation of the  children's conscience  are                     main factors of the preventive  method.  Usually, they avoid grave faults. The                     Father  writes,  \"However,  since  human  nature    is    inclined    to  evil  and  some                     people    are    bad-natured,  especially    those  born  in  poverty,    it  is  sometimes                     necessary  to combine  religious  and civil education with some  punishment  to                     compel them to behave\" (Vol. l, page 266).                          As  we  have   related before,  the  Father  calls  the  full attention of the                     educator on this subject (Ch.  l7,  no.  6).  He writes:                           1.  Punishment  will  be  never  frequent  nor  disproportionate  to  the  fault.                     Punishments  are  like  medicaments:  if  used  frequently,  no  benefit  is  received    592                     from them,  and,  therefore,  people  feel compelled  to increase the amount;  but                     the more the  medicaments are used, the less is their beneficial effect, and other                     medicine will  substitute  them.  An  institute  of  education  under  the sisters'                     direction cannot adopt this course, using punishments as to  reach  such a degree                     that the pupils become unconcerned  with them;  should  it happen,  the institute                     would  become  a  house    of  correction,    the  children's  community  would  go  to                     ruin,  and  the spirit  of the sisters who are devoted to education would come to                     an  end  because  they  would  find  themselves  in  difficulties,    would  become                     annoyed  losing  internal  peace,    etc.;    everything  would  be  in  disorder.                     Punishments, therefore, must be rare, or better yet, very rare and moderate.                          2.  Punishments must be proportionate to the faults.  When they  are  applied                     in excess,  like medicaments  they  harm  the patient,  sometimes  even killing.                     Hence,    the  sister  will  never  punish    out  of  resentment,    but  when  she  is                     compelled to  punish, she  will act according to reason punishing less than it  is                     due (Vol. l, page 267).","3. An excellent method of education that the prefect of our institutes will                     adopt  is  persuasion. Either in  the  case  of correction or punishment or warning,                     the prefect will strive  to persuade the pupils of their fault through Fatherly, but                     resolute words;  after disproving their excuses, he will sometimes require their                     assent,  as for instance by asking:  are you persuaded  of your  fault?  Do you                     agree with what I have said to you?  And the like.  He  will  use persuasion to                     condition children  to  accept punishment  favorably and profit by it\" (Vol.  3,                     page ll3).  He warns the sisters to make the guilty accept the punishment before                     giving it, persuading her with good words that she herself accept it  to  atone the                     Lord for her fault and then carry it  out  with humility of heart and docility (Vol.                     l, page 267).                           We    have    a    good    example  in  a  letter    of   the    Father.    To alleviate  the                     poverty of a large family, the Father had sheltered a boy in the institute of Oria.                     The boy, however, did not submit to  be  parted  from his family,  and wrote  to                     the  Father.  He answered,                           I    have  received  your  letter.    You  tell  me  that  you  want  to  return  home,                     because your character tells you to do so. Since the obstinate is your character,                     not you, we should have pity on you. Please,  what is this character?  I do not                     understand.  Is Alfred one  thing and the character another one?  In this case  I                     would  like  to  know  who  is  the  obstinate,    Alfred  or  the  character?      If  the                     obstinate  is the character,  whereas Alfred is  docile  and reasonable,  Alfred          593                     should scold his character.  Besides,  we are not concerned with the character,  it                     may go to ruin. instead, we want  to save Alfred,  despite his rascal character                     wants to lose him. What does Alfred think of it?                          Let  me explain what is the character of Alfred.  It is  the unfortunate custom                     of living,  doing his own will, free without a guide until the age of thirteen.  This                     is a worst custom, because the  Holy Spirit says,  \"Happy the man who carries                     the yoke since his teens.\" Character is natural bent. Your bad natural bent must                     be corrected. It would be a nice thing if an unreasonable, or ill behaving person                     could say,  \"It is not                     me. It's the character; have pity on me!\"                          Dear Alfred,  the character is our will, nor more, nor less. You have not the                     age to do what you want. You ask me the favor of letting  you  return home.                     Your request shows that  you  are  an unreasonable  boy.  I  did the favor when I                     took you to Oria  for your education and instruction. This is my character: doing                     good for the boys like you.  When are you going to get wise?  I assure you that if                     I were your father...  I supposed that you were  able to  understand  what  is your                     good and what is your  evil!  Pray, pray, pray to the Madonna for enlightenment!                           In  the postscript the Father adds,  \"The character you  are talking about is the                     devil with horns,  which tries to ruin  you, and for this reason he tempts you\"                     (S.C. Vol. 5, page l04).","4.  Prayer. Before imposing a penalty, even a light one, the sister must ask the                     Lord for enlightenment, so that no one is mistaken (Vol. l, page 267).                          5.  Simulated subtraction of affection:  driving back the approaching child,                     showing  a  sullen  face,  and  showing  no  love  are  moral  punishments.      When                     friendly  relations  of  pure,   holy affection  between  teacher  and  pupils  are                     well-established,  simulated    withdrawing    of  affection  is  the  greatest                     punishment, which may be emphasized and prolonged according to the faults.                          When  a sister approaches the child who is  being  punished, she  may be of                     great  assistance  by    helping  the  child  to    reflect  upon  her  fault  and  the                     punishment,  and  exhorting  her  to  go  to  the  teacher    who    imposed  the                     punishment.  For good  results,  it  is indispensable that punishment be used very                     seldom.  Its  frequent use becomes abuse.  In fact, the wise educator strives to                     prevent having to punish faults (Vol. l, page 268).                       Notes                            (l)  Lawyer  Angel Toscano  (he was not a  relative  to  the Father)   was  a   qualified                     journalist and a  poet  of  classical taste.  He  died young under the ruin of the l908  earthquake.                     A right man,  he appreciated the philanthropical institution by the Father, even though he had no                     relation with him, nor he supported the Catholic field.  We did not succeed to find those verses.                     The  Father  confined  himself  to  saying,  \"They  have  been  published  in  a  non  Catholic    594                     newspaper.  But,  that is how it is,   everyone  in Messina  loves  these  orphanages.\"  Perhaps                     the  newspaper  was Lucifer,  founded and edited by Toscano.  Obviously,  the  Father disliked                     to boost it.  We have sought for it in Messina, Palermo, and  Naples,  but  in  vain.  Someone                     could find a  copy  in  the libraries.                           (2) A surgeon of international fame.

Assunta,\" Rome, l968-69.","(4)  It is of help reporting some of the Father's examples, in which he reveals himself a smart                     psychologist:                           For instance,  a sister making the sign of the cross before little children in a careless or                     irreverent manner is implying to them  that  the  sign of the cross is  unimportant.  She  may  be                     unaware of the impression she is creating.  A sister or assistant who  in the presence of even                     three  year    old  children,    speaks  to  the  superior  disrespectfully,    diminishes  for  them  the                     principle of  divine authority,  which is shared by the people who are in a position  of superior.                     A  sister  or  assistant  eating  or    drinking  greedily  in  the  presence  of  children,    teaches  them                     gluttony in a masterly manner.                          We  could give many examples which would seem  trifles,  but which  have  the  power to                     waste   the    orphaned    children's    soul  because   his pure,   tender  mind  is  able  to  feel  in  the                     innermost the bad qualities that a teacher nurtures tacitly or temporarily. For instance, if a sister                     or assistant is troubled by a voluntary grudge  against another,  she is unable to conceal it.  Even                     the least  perceptive child perceives it as though he were penetrated by a magnetic influx (Vol. l,                     page 246).                           (5) The Father wrote some rules about how to eat.  They were read twice a month in the                     refectory:                           Moral precepts:  l) Say the prayer before and after eating. 2) Eat to obey the natural law,  to                     keep yourself in good health, and to live according to the will of God,  not for  gluttony.  3)                     Listen to the spiritual reading at dinner so that the soul may be nourished.  4) Think of so many                     poor who are hungry,  and resolve to help them as you can. 5) Think of the eternal celestial                     table, where  Jesus our Lord is waiting for us in his kingdom to give us the food of eternal glory,                     if we deserve it.                          Hygienic precepts: Eat slowly, and chew well the food. 2) Do not  eat  too  hot  food because                     it ruins  your  teeth  and  your digestion.  3)  Do  not  drink cold beverage  soon  after  eating   595                     because it ruins your digestion and your teeth.                          Fine manners precepts:  Eat what you are given without complaining, and get used to eating                     any food.  2) Eat with fine manners  and take your time.  3) Do not dirty  your  hands,  your                     face,    and  your  napkin.    4)  Do  not  rest  your  elbows  on  the  table.  5)  Eat  in  silence  without                     making noise (S.C. Vol. l0, page l60).","596","l9.                                                                            PRUDENCE                                            l.

The virtues' regulator                              After treating the theological virtues which unite us to God directly, we move                     to the moral virtues. They help and perpetuate our  union with God by regulating                     our actions in such a way as to aim  at  God  continuously  despite  the  internal                     and  external obstacles.                          Prudence  is  the  first among  the  moral  virtues.  It  is considered  the  queen                     because no virtue can  achieve  perfection without  the guide of prudence,  which                     leads the human  faculties toward  their  end.  Prudence  is  also said the  driver                     of  the virtues,  because it regulates them according to reason, persons, place,                     time, and social relations; as well as inclines the human intellect  to choose the                     best  means  in  order  to    subordinate    the  particular    ends  to  the  last  end.    In                     practical terms prudence is defined the virtue that decides what we have to do or                     to avoid in order to reach the supernatural end,  following the principles of faith.                          Let  us listen to the Father speaking about  the  superior's prudence.                           Prudence  must  be one of the superior's chief  virtues;  it regulates  the others                     and consists in understanding well  and  in being  aware  of everything,  either                     spiritual  or  temporal.  It prevents the members of the community from rushing,                     from going to extremes,   leading  them  to  take  the  happy  mean.   Prudence           598                     dissimulates,  is forbearing,  patient, cautious, wise, vigilant, experienced, and                     always watchful.                          However,    the    superior    must  distinguish  between    holy    and  profane                     prudence.  As a matter of fact,  we find  prudence coming from  the  Lord's  spirit                     and  false  prudence  coming  from  the world's. The former acts for God's glory                     and  for the good of the souls,   controls  itself,   dissimulates,  and  counsels;                     human  prudence  instead,    acts  for  human  aims  and  earthly  interests.    It  puts                     aside  God and the good of the souls for human respect  and personal attachment.                     The superior will detest human prudence as a pestilence and shall not seek, think                     of, or dissimulate for human respect,  personal regard and liking.   It does not                     mean, however, that  we have to pay no special courtesy toward  the people of                     high rank, because prudence","is not a rough virtue and doing otherwise would  be  imprudence.  The prudent                     superior  will  never    come    to  terms  with  his  conscience  for  anyone  and  for                     whatever reason, and  in dubious cases will resort to prayer and advice.  To spare                     the community  serious damages coming from imprudence,  the  superior will                     pray for prudence every day to the adorable our Lord  Jesus Christ,  the Holy                     Spirit,  and the most holy Virgin Mary,  who is called  Virgin most prudent.  He                     will often read the wisdom books to  know how the Holy Spirit praises the virtue                     of prudence (Vol. l, page 203).                        2. Always prudent                              The  Father's government was prudent,  full  of  discretion, strong,  and  in the                     same time tender.  He was resolute and well-balanced.                          Even    when    he  reproached,    he  did    so    without    bitterness.  Instead    of                     stressing  our  malice in our  faults,  he  made  us perceive the grief of his heart,                     and above all the grief of the heart  of God,  thus achieving good effects.  None                     of  those  who abandoned  the  institute bore grudges or hatred toward  him;  he          599                     always remained the Father, because he sought the good of all.                          He    was    clear-sighted  in  the  understanding  of  the    spirits,  and    involved                     himself  in  the  good  both  to  defend  it  and  to    avoid  evil.    To  avoid  that                     disagreement  grow  worse,    he  considered    the  parties  in  the  right  and  in  the                     wrong  with  supernatural  prudence,  leading  them  to  harmony.  And  when  he                     happened  to  moderate  debates  either    in  our  communities  or  outside  he  acted                     with very  refined Christian diplomacy.                          His teaching, actions, and aspirations were always according to  the gospel's                     saying,    \"Seek  first  his  kingship  over  you,    his  way  of  holiness\"  (Mt.  6,  33).                     Through his fervent words he helped us see hell and paradise, hate sin and be                     enamored of virtue, but he  never went to the extremes.  Rigor was sometimes                     noticed  in others,  not  in  the Father;  he rather restored the balance  in awkward                     situations.                          The sisters point out that when the Father had to dismiss a daughter, he acted                     with all caution providing her with money and something else in order that she                     might easily face her new","situation in the world.                          He remedied the private faults in secret.                          A  Religious who was an assistant of the orphans for several years reports,                     \"When someone was at fault,  the Father talked to him in private so that no one                     knew of it. For instance, one day I projected  a movie to the children without                     informing  the  Father who was out of Avignone,  in Messina. Even though I was                     in charge to  show the movie,  the Father admonished me because he demanded                     not  only obedience,  but also tact.  But,  no one knew  of  that caution.\"                        3. Prayer to the most holy Virgin                              Let us consider a few details.                          The  virtues are a gift from God,  but also the fruit of our cooperation to grace.                     Humble,  fervent,  constant prayer is  the first  cooperation.  We quote a l888                     prayer  of  the  Father  to    the  most  holy  Virgin  to  achieve  holy  prudence.    By                     reading it we come to  know  his program of life at the sign of prudence,  which          600                     he insistently implores from Immaculate Mary.                          He  begins  praying by making a protest of humility  and  by confessing that                     he is imperfect in such a virtue.                           Virgin  most  prudent,  pray for us! Pray for me!  Model  of perfect prudence,                     pray for me because as a priest at the head of so many souls,  I am obliged to                     practice this virtue! I have come to your feet,  holy Mother,  to ask you for this                     virtue.  For the sake  of your divine prudence,  hear me.  You are abounding                     with this great Christian virtue, let me share in it because I am very needy of it!                           The various tasks of prudence are specified this way:                           Holy  Mother,  enlighten my dim understanding by  perfecting the  exercise of                     my faculties through prudence.  Give me copious and effective","grace so that in all my actions I propose an honest aim  for the greater glory of                     God,  my  sanctification,  and  the sanctification  of  my neighbor.  See to it that I                     undertake  no enterprise  before  pondering  it  wisely,   taking  advice,  and                     praying.  Give me copious and effective grace.   May I choose and proportion                     the  means  to the end,  decide and work  with  care, patience,  magnanimity,                     holy haste,  expectation,  and  decision according  to  cases and circumstances.  I                     ask you the  grace  of keeping silent or speaking,  of knowing how to show or to                     hide  my  inside,    of    coming  to  terms  or  being  firm,    of  understanding  and                     knowing things as they really are.                          Prudence is connected with past, present, and future.                           Virgin most prudent, remind me of my past and see to it that experience guide                     and govern me in the future, being attentive and cautious in the present.  May I                     ponder  my  thoughts,    my  words,  my  actions,  what  I  listen  to,  and  judge                     everything  properly.  Make  me  provident    for    the  future,    foreseeing  the                     consequences  of  any action,  thought,  words,  and omissions. Whatsoever I do                     or omit  be not against Christian prudence.                           There is also a profane prudence, the prudence of the flesh, which  is  against                     Christian prudence.  The Father  entreats  the Madonna to keep him from such                     prudence.                                                                                                               601                          Virgin most prudent,  let me abhor the false prudence of the world  and  of                     the  flesh.  Give me  the  prudence  which  shone perfectly  in  your adorable                     only-begotten son,  our  Lord  Jesus Christ.  You  were  a most perfect mirror of                     him,  whereas   the saints  were  perfect imitators.  I ask for the prudence  of  the                     serpent    which    is  joined  with  the  preeminent  simplicity    of    the  dove;    the                     prudence which is diametrically opposed to the  false maxims of the world;  the                     prudence which is a gift of the counsel and  makes people esteem as nothing the                     things of the world  such as pleasures,  honors, and satisfaction; the prudence                     which makes me  appreciate  the  heavenly things and the  holy  virtues;  the                     prudence which does not weigh things in the prospect of time  and the senses, but                     eternity,  faith,  and  spirit.  Virgin  most  prudent,  keep    me    from  imprudent                     behavior for the sake of the  most  holy Heart  of Jesus;  keep me from acting                     hurrily  or  by  temerity,    by  impulse      of      affection      or      imagination,      by                     rashness   or thoughtlessness. Above all I entreat you to give me prudence as a                     guardianship  and  a  latch  of  my  tongue  and  mouth!    For  the  sake  of  your                     motherly  charity,  may  I come to  an  end  with  speaking imprudently!  Virgin                     most prudent,  keep me from  extremes,  from negligence  or  slowness when I                     carry out  your divine  will,  my duties, and the works of charity.","He concludes with a very fervent entreaty:                           O  very  compassionate Mother,  you are  very  powerful  and merciful! You                     can grant such a great favor,  this beautiful grace even  to a most imprudent man                     like me! I am like a little  donkey at  your feet! Virgin most prudent,  make me                     prudent,  see to  it that  I  practice prudence this year(1) to console the most  holy                     Heart  of Jesus in everything,  and to edify  the  people.  Amen, amen. For the                     sake of Jesus and St. Joseph, hear me. For the sake of the angels and the saints,                     hear me.  For the sake of the most holy Trinity, hear me, amen (S.C. Vol. 10,                     page 9).                           This    prayer  perhaps  makes  reference  to  the  picture  we    drew  by    lots    in                     1888,  which  had  prudence as  the  virtue  to  be practiced.  But,  the  father had                     a predilection for  Our Lady   of Good   Counsel,   to  whom he  often appealed.                     Furthermore,  he  had written five small prayers for his daily recitation.  In fact,                     we read  in his notes,  \"My particular prayers to Our Lady  of  Good Counsel\"                     (S.C. Vol. 10, page 38).                          Later  he makes reference to the poet  Arici,  whose  verses probably  ended                     the  prayer,    which  begins  with:    \"Virgin    Mother,  smiling    image...\"    The                     reference dates back to the  difficulties which  hindered the institute in the early                     times.                                                                                                               602                           The  elegant,  lyric  poet Arici from Brescia,  one of  the chosen  group  at the                     beginning of our century      wrote  beautiful verses  in honor of the most holy                     Virgin under the title of  Good Counsel  (our padre was writing on October 14,                     1900).   I  often called them to my mind when the storm grew so furious that I                     saw no way to escape it. Through those delicate verses I exclaimed:                           As the pilgrim on his way saw you clearing                          The sky of clouds by blinking your eyelash,                          Mother, clear and save my ship for sailing                                                    Send me a flash!                                                   (S.C. Vol. 10, page 212).","4. Prayer and advice                              The  Father's exhortations to his children to do  everything with prayer were                     mainly directed to himself,  or better yet, they echoed his practice.  In fact,  even                     though  he  acted  in  the  light  of    divine  presence  continuously,    still,    before                     undertaking any enterprise, he felt the need to pray as much as the importance of                     the matter required.  Furthermore,  he made people pray also  for his counselors                     that they might know the will of God.                          He  once  wrote  to  Father  Vitale,    \"I  agree  upon  the  fact  that  prudence    is                     needed;  however,  because this virtue has  various degrees,  such  as  prudence                     of pure reason,  reason  and  faith, ordinary faith, extraordinary faith, etc. we                     must combine it with prayer and counsel. Ecclesiasticus says, \"Make up a heart                     of good counsel; it will be your best counselor.\" (The Father tells us to take  this                     saying with pure intention).  And  elsewhere,  \"Before taking advice from men,                     take it from God\" (Vol. 3l, page l2). The Father followed this revealed teaching.                          When Mrs.  Jensen retired,  the burden of the orphanage  and the religious                     community  fell  on  the  shoulders  of  the  Father,    who  wrote  an  offering  of  the                     mass, in which he prayed, \"My Lord Jesus Christ, I beseech you to show me the                     counselors to whom I have to resort. At the same time I beg you to enlighten                     them so that they behave  according  to  your will.  You are  omnipotent.  For  the       603                     offering of this mass of endless value see to it that the hellish enemy may not                     prevail over in this affair, but everything come to your greater glory,  your will,                     and satisfaction\" (Vol.  6, page l).  While  waiting for Msgr.  Guarino's decision,                     he asks Saint Joseph  \"to give copious enlightenment to the archbishop so  that                     his  advice,    warning,    manifestation,    concession,  reprimand,  and  action  be  a                     perfect manifestation of the divine will,  and divine will be done regardless of                     our passions and intentions.\" Then  he delivers everything to Saint Joseph: his                     mind, heart, tongue, and above all his right hand. \"Deign to guide it when I write;                     may it write   what  your  divine  spirit  and  right  reason   suggest, regardless  of                     passions and the suggestion of the hellish  enemy\" (Vol. 6, page ll).                          On another occasion he appeals to Our Lady of the Letter. \"I entreat  you  to                     enlighten me in this circumstance in  order  to behave according to divine will.                     Free me from my foolish opinion","and guide me according to divine grace...  Holy Mother, enlighten me  and  my                     counselors so that you yourself  counsel  me  through them\"  (Vol.  7,  page l6).                     Perhaps  the  Father  wrote  this  prayer  when  he  asked  for  renouncing  canonry,                     because he  added  one  \"Our  Father,   Hail  Mary, and Glory  be\"  to Saint John                     Baptist De Rossi, whose devotion was recommended by Msgr. Guarino in l883,                     when the Father presented the renunciation.                          In a particular case he asks the Madonna, \"If you want me to appeal to M. A.                     (Msgr. Archbishop)  or to P. E. (Padre Eugenio of Sortino,  a  holy  Capuchin)  or                     to others,  let me  know!  While appealing to these holy ministers,  make me ask                     their advice with simplicity  and truth,  and you yourself enlighten them  so  that                     they  guide  me according to the most holy Heart of Jesus\"  (S.C. Vol. l0, page                     7).                          On  another  occasion he makes the orphaned  girls  pray  to Saint Joseph.  \"O                     holy patriarch, for the sake of the child Jesus and Immaculate Mary enlighten the                     Father  so  that  he  may  behave  in  everything  according  to  justice,    charity,                     prudence, and equity\" (Vol. 8, page 2l).                          In l9l0, when the institutes of Francavilla were battled and those    of  Sicily                     were running the risk of  being  involved,  the Father  offers the holy mass to the                     most holy Trinity through the intercession   of  Our  Lady  of  Good  Counsel.                     He  asks   for enlightenment on how he should behave.                           Grant  me  a  particular  help  and  the  gift  of  counsel  in    these  circumstances,   604                     perplexities, past, present, and future events, as well  as in the coming  anguish,                     uncertainty,  tribulation,  and persecution.  For  the sake of this most precious                     offering of the mass,  enlighten,  guide, govern, regulate, and advise me. See to it                     that  the  gift of counsel be effective in  me  through  your enlightenment  and                     inspiration! Enlighten  also  my  counselors, letting  me know who they are and                     how I have to take advice.  May both  of  us  please  your most holy  will  and                     the  most  holy, compassionate   Heart  of  Jesus,   for  the  sanctification  and                     salvation of souls,  your greater glory,  and the defeat of Satan (Vol. 4, page l20).                           He  combines  prayer  and  advice.   We  know  some  of  his counselors,                     such as Don Cusmano,  Father Ludwig of Casoria,  Don Bosco,  Msgr.  Pennino,                     his confessors,  his own Religious,  and after the l908 earthquake Don Orione.","He wanted us to imitate him.  \"When the mother superior  and the sisters must                     take  advice  from  spiritual  directors,    they  have  to    pray  in  advance  for  their                     enlightenment and the enlightenment of their counselors.  By so doing we trust                     that our Lord and  the most  holy  Virgin  will let us have the right advice  from                     wise person,  from a pious,  learned,  and wise priest\" (Vol. l, pages l95-96).                        5.  ...Were light to his steps                              Prayer  and  advice were light to the Father,  all his  life long.  Writing to the                     Capuchin Sisters of Citta' di Castello,  he says,  \"I do everything by taking advice                     from the  wise,  seeking the pure glory of God,  at least in my intention, because I                     am so miserable in my actions\" (Vol. 38, page l).                          How  prudent he was in giving the name to his congregations! He waited until                     l90l, and in October of the same year he mailed a circular  to the bishops sacred                     allies,  to whom he revealed  his anxiety for getting the final names of his ideal                     (Ch. 5, no. 9).                          The Father did the same for the garb of the Rogationists. We read in his notes,                     \"On September 7, l909, I began celebrating 33 masses for the Rogationists garb\"           605                     (Vol. 6, page l09).                          While  writing  the  rules  for  the  sisters,    at  a  certain  point  the  Father  asks                     himself, \"Should the mother superior obey someone of the sisters in anything?\"                     Being in a state of uncertainty,  he wrote,  \"I  will  answer this question after                     taking  advice  and enlightenment\" (Vol. l, page l80).                          Even  the names of the sisters should be inspired in prayer. For  instance,  a                     probationer  asked the  Father  to  be  called Crocifissa  at her taking of the garb,                     but  a few days later the Father told her, \"I have prayed. I don't feel to call you                     so.\" He gave her the name of Marcellina.                          Transfers  of  persons  were  prepared  and  accompanied  by prayer. He wrote                     to  Mother  Nazzarena,  \"Pray  and  make  people  pray,  because    any  transfer  of                     persons must conform to the will of  the divine superiors\" (Vol. 35, page 264).","When the sisters of Taormina were ending the building of the funeral chapel, the                     mother  superior  asked  the  Father  for  an  inscription,  and    insisted  to  have  it                     quickly.  But he answered, \"You do not understand the importance of the matter.                     This must be a   memoir  to  posterity;   therefore,   we  must   invoke   the                     enlightenment  of  heaven  with prayer  and   mortification.\"  He delivered the                     following  inscription  after  three  days.  \"They  lived  united  -  in  the  love  of  the                     celestial spouse Jesus - Daughters of the  Divine  Zeal  of his Heart - each of                     them  lays  here  - the mortal  remains,  to  put  them on glorious - on the day  of                     the universal resurrection\" (Vol. 43, page 89).                          He   \"faced   grave   difficulties  in  founding   his   two congregations  and                     several  branch  houses.    But  he    overcame    them  with    patience    and  faith,                     because  he  always  prayed  and  made    us  pray  to  Jesus,  Our  Lady,  the  saints,                     especially  Saint  Joseph,  and  the    archangels  patrons.    Furthermore,    he  took                     advice    from    the  wise,    the  holy  persons,    and  above  all  from  Archbishop                     Guarino.\" He used to say, \"Do everything after taking counsel, and you will have                     nothing    to    repent  of...      As  to  the  main  matters    of    his  communities,    he                     gathered his priests for advice.\" \"Owing to  his prudent  government,  the female                     congregation  was  not  dissolved.\"  Says    Brother  Louis,    \"Father  Bonarrigo                     confided to me  that  the Servant  of God often went to him for advice.  In fact,                     in  the funeral  oration  for Father Bonarrigo the Servant of God  called him 'his                     first counselor';  and he carried out his  advice,  even when  Bonarrigo  was  not a                     priest.\" Before  acting,  the  Father meditated,  prayed,  took advice,  and asked        606                     for our  prayer.  He often  told us,  \"Pray today,  and above all tomorrow during                     the  holy  mass  for  a  business  of  ours.\"  The  next  day,    he  used  to  say,  \"Pray,                     because  the  will  of God is still unknown  to  me!\"   A Religious writes, \"I never                     noticed the Father acting imprudently, all  the  more because he often took advice                     from the Servants  of God and made us pray,  especially when important matters                     were  at hand.  He  also  gathered his nearer cooperators to find out  the best                     means for the guidance of our communities.  I never realized any  inappropriate                     decisions.   He  was  also  moderate  in  his exhortations.\"                          Outstanding persons, such as bishops, appreciated his virtue and took advice                     from him.  For instance, the bishop of Oria often said,  \"Papa Hannibal gave and                     will  give  us  advice.\"  I  myself  saw  outstanding    lay  and  ecclesiastical  persons                     approaching  him  for advice.","At the end of this topic we quote a Daughter of the  Sacred Side.  \"On  the                     whole  he  carried out his  matters  with  great prudence,  and  he did the same in                     advising  and    governing,    even  though  his  zeal  was  sometimes  judged  a  little                     strong.  He  taught us to govern ourselves, foreseeing his demise.\"                        6. He never went to excesses                              While  examining the Father's activities,  we meet facts and evidences which                     bring to light his supernatural prudence.                          An  employee remembers:  \"When a person was  at  fault,  the Father was                     severe and mild in the same time because he was always prudent  and lovable.  It                     also happened when he had to  reproach. One day I touched upon a colleague as                     a sign of hugging,  but the Father hinted at disapproval with a gesture. However,                     when he met me  alone  he almost begged pardon,  yet saying that getting  the                     habit  of greeting the way I did was imprudent.\"  Even though  he practiced the                     virtues heroically,  he did not demand heroism from others;  on  the contrary,  he                     hardly granted the permission  for it...                          He  warmly  recommended  bodily  health,    and  like  Saint  Bernard  called        607                     exagerated penances of youth craziness.  Evil was  to  be prevented:  if  a sister                     entered the bakery  wearing sticked pins or needles,  which could fall into dough,                     she had to abstain from receiving Communion.  \"Even though he exhorted people                     to practice virtue  in high degree,  he almost never granted  permission  for heavy                     mortification.\"  For instance,  a sister asked him to  eat only bread on the Lent                     Fridays.  The Father responded, \"It is not possible,  because  bread is expensive                     now:  fast as in the other days,  Good Friday excepted; on that day you can eat                     bread only.\" To another sister,  \"I do not let you sleep dressed on the plank-bed                     all nights.  Because you work all day, you should go to sleep at l0:00 p.  m. on a                     normal mattress, sleeping calmly at the feet of Jesus,  our supreme goodness.  To                     please you, however, I grant you  the  permission to sleep on the plank-bed for                     one  night  a week;  but,  lay a blanket on the plank and cover yourself\" (Vol. 34,                     page 34).","To point out how a mother superior should behave when the sisters want                     to do voluntary penances, we quote.                           The  mother  superior  will  moderate  and  control  the    voluntary  penances,                     keeping in mind:                          a.  The sister's  health,  work,  and  job.      b.  The mother superior will also                     look at the improvement in the virtues of obedience,  humility, zeal, and accuracy                     while the sisters  perform their own duty or when they renounce  their  own will                     and  opinion,    etc.    Some  souls  happen  to  deceive  themselves  through    bodily                     penances;  they are able to  do  hardest  bodily penances  without hesitating to                     break holy  obedience,  humility, charity,  fulfillment of their duty,  etc.  These                     souls  consider themselves  saints for their bodily penances,  but persist in the                     bad practice of the virtues becoming obstinate, somehow stubborn,                     negligent,      angry,      etc.    Depriving    them    of    their    voluntary  whimsical                     penances and inflicting other penances,  helps them. If they  are willing to amend                     their vices in order to  achieve  holy virtues,  they  may be allowed to perform                     voluntary penances with discretion;  they,  however, must be told to offer their                     penances  to    the    Lord    with    the  aim  at  amending      their    bad    habit    and                     improving  religious  virtues;  otherwise,  they  will  be  forbidden  to  perform                     voluntary penances (Vol. l, page 2l7).                           Read  how  a  sister  judges  the  Father's  prudence  while correcting.   \"He       608                     corrected  and  remedied  the  faults  as  the circumstances  required,  but I often                     saw him silent by prudence. Either counseling or correcting, he never went to the                     extremes. I once referred things of the house to outside girls;  the  Father patted                     me on the head and  wrote this warning for me,  'Never talk with outsiders of                     things of the house'.\"                          People relates of the Father as confessor. Says a sister, \"I went to the Father as                     an extraordinary confessor, and realized an angelical  prudence,  as  prudent he                     was in the  government.  The glory  of God and the salvation of souls were  his                     aim,  whereas prayer  and  meditation  were  the  means.\"  Other  sisters:   \"I                     confessed  to  him  once,  noticing  his  discretion...  He  only confessed   in                     exceptional  cases,   when  people  insisted  for spiritual direction.  He used to                     say  that  he  was  a  superior,    and  therefore      he    could    not    be  an  ordinary                     confessor.\"  \"I  once confessed  to  him,  and realized no rigor.\" \"Quite a few  of                     us asked  him  for confession,  but he refused because  he  was  the superior of                     the  institute.\"  Someone  pointed  out,    \"The  Father  was  never  imprudent:  he                     wanted a short confession.\"","Let  us  read  the  Father's  letter  to  Father  Moramarco,  a  confessor  of  the                     Daughters of Divine Zeal in Altamura.                           I  warmly recommend that the confessions in my community  be relatively                     short in the ambit of the sacrament. The rules and the customs  of the institute,                     as well as perfect conformity to  the orders of the superior and the master in the                     external  discipline must  be observed.  Woe,  if the confessors do not conform to                     the  external    discipline    while    treating  the    forum    of    conscience!                     Inconveniences  and  insubordinations  come  out  upsetting   the communities, as                     experience teaches.                          When  a  female community is lucky to have a confessor  from the  twin male                     community,  it is a guaranty! But it is  the  same when  the  outside confessor is                     wise,    prudent,    cautious,    and  experienced.      He      hardly    believes    the                     complaints      and      the  subterfuges    of    someone    who    interweaves    a    vent                     against  the superiors  instead  of confessing her faults humbly.  She can  do such                     a  thing so naturally and skillfully that an  inexperienced confessor can tell her                     that she is right, to the prejudice of her soul and the community's discipline.                          I  beg your pardon for this warning,  but I remind you  that the Lord dislikes                     the despising of the elders' admonitory  words. I have a long, painful experience                     on this subject!                          Make use of Saint Augustine's saying,  \"Your talk with women be  short and                     harsh,\" especially with the devout ones! Lead  each soul  to  obedience,  respect,        609                     love,  and holy fear of  her  own superior!  Refuse any talk of curiosity,  etc.  By                     doing so,  you will realize how the souls grow better.  Avoid long  confessions,                     cut  the extras,  and accustom the penitent to short confessions: yes,  yes,  no,  no.                     A person accustomed to spending half, three quarters,  or an hour for confession,                     gives a bad example to the community.  I  hate  it! I used to hear confessions of                     seventeen Sisters  of  the Charity in an hour;  nor could  I  stay  longer, because                     they themselves made it impossible! Those are souls! Thus we  must  educate the                     souls,  especially the ones belonging to  a nascent community! (S.C. Vol. 5, page                     302).                           Wise  rules of docility and submission are also valid  after the Second Vatican                     Council.    Ample  and  exhaustive  as  the  dialogue  may  be,  obedience  is  always                     obedience, and after all we know that \"superiors...  retain  their  own  authority                     to  decide  and  to prescribe what is to be done\" (P.C. no. l4).                          One  day,  a young Religious in Oria committed  some  faults which  ended  in                     a soldier-like outburst in the presence  of  two brethren,  and the day after he                     received Communion without making amends.  The  Father was informed.  He                     wrote from Messina to the prefect asking him to relate \"his fatherly warning to                     the guilty; to exhort him to confess as soon as possible after","making a spiritual  retreat;  and to find out a confessor who declares him guilty.                     The  point  is,  if  the  confessor  will  declare  him  innocent,  because    he    is  too                     indulgent or because the  confession  is  not integral,   the  Religious  will  be                     lost!  Many  persons  ended unhappily this way!\" (Vol. 30, page 52).                          When   the  superior  general  visited  a   community,   she manifested little                     trust in the mother superior of the house.  The Father warned and instructed the                     superior general.                           That  superior is somehow to be pitied,  and you did well by informing  me                     about  everything.    But  I  cannot  approve    that    the  sisters    understood  your                     disapproval  for  the    superior's    faults.  You  should  have  avoided  the  sisters'                     attention  on her faults. At least exteriorly,  you had to appear indifferent and                     support her. She wrote from Oria very humbly.  After all, she is a good sister and                     we  should  listen to her justifications.  You did  well  to establish  the  actions  in                     common,   but  I  don't  think  that everything  was  in a jumbled confusion.                     Also,  we  cannot  give credit to everything the  youth  say of a new superior,                     especially  when    she  is  somehow  curious  to  ascertain  the  truth.    It  is    also                     possible that they pushed her to some excess,  and now charge her with  that.                     This sister edified this community in  many  things! (Vol. 35, page 98).                                                                                                               610                          To make sure of the secret,  several sisters appealed to the seal of confession                     while writing to the Father, but he responded, \"Do not say seal of confession,                     because we are out of confession, and also because the directors cannot be given                     seals.  You should rely on their discretion\" (Vol. 34, page 88).                        7. New foundations                              How  prudent  the  Father  was in  the  foundation  of   new communities!                          He  requires  at  least a  month of  particular  prayers  and celebrations  of                     masses. Then, he suggests to check the place and the buildings to see whether                     they are suitable, hygienic,","etc. \"The opening of a new community in an unsanitary house or in an unsanitary                     place, or having no electricity, air, and water must be refused\" (Vol.  l,  page                     l83).  First,  we should consider the availability of the Religious, who will be                     certainly  available  if  we    take    proper    care  of  their  training.    \"When    the                     spiritual,  intellectual,    and    domestic    formation  is  well    done,    our    Lord                     continues sending good vocations,  because the institute  becomes an  ark  of                     salvation and of sanctification for the  congregants\" (Vol. l, page l82).                          The    Father  disliked  to  work  in  public  bodies,    and  to    keep  absolute                     independence and freedom of action, he always refused to erect his orphanages                     as public bodies.                          The maintenance of the communities should not be assured  in full.  \"Fixed                     income  for the whole maintenance of  the  orphans cannot   be claimed,  because                     we have to fulfill the gap by  work and  divine providence,  in which we have to                     trust.  On the other hand, we won't tempt God by founding orphanages in places                     where, humanly speaking, there is little or no hope to succeed\" (Vol. l, page l84).                          To consolidate the existent houses,  sometimes Father Vitale tried  to slacken                     the Father's fits.  The Father  wrote,  \"I  too would  like  to have only a house,                     but  good;    and  if  the    events  urge?    Perhaps  there  is  also  my  pride  or                     irresponsibility,    and  I  pray  to  the  Lord  to  let  me  open  no  house,  unless  etc.                     However, if a  too good opportunity offers,  I have no courage to refuse  it! Let                     us pray!\" (Vol. 3l, page 9). In l9l0 the cholera broke out in Trani. Was the Father                     able  to  leave  the  orphans  in  dire  want?  Not  at  all.    Therefore  he  opens  an   611                     orphanage for girls on the side of the laboratory he had opened a month before.                     The holy man  Msgr. Carrano  was puzzled...  The Father wrote to the mother                     superior general,                           As  usual,    Monsignor  declaims,    reproves,    approves,    wants,  dislikes,                     censures, praises, does not look in the face, and gives me money.  He gave me                     300 liras and is ready to give 950 more for the equipment,  because we have to                     buy everything for the orphans who are poorest! Long live Jesus!... Monsignor                     nearly reprimanded me because I receive the orphans without having any means;                     at my answering that I am sheltering only five of them, he kept silent. Later  he                     sent  people to tell me that I  should  take  thirteen orphans in honor of Saint                     Anthony! (Vol. 35, page 48).                           As in everything,  the Father's wishes for foundations  were subordinate  to                     God's will.  In l9l2, the sisters were ready to give","their  service  to  the  Carmelites'  parish  in  Padua  (cf.    Vol.  34,    page  94).    The                     pastor,    however,  made  very  harsh  conditions,  and  the  Father  renounced  his                     project by writing,                           It  is true that we wish to form a community in  Padua;  our wish,  however, is                     moderate and submitted to the will of God, who wants us to act prudently.  You                     demand of the sisters to live  at the  expenses of the institute and to givi to the                     pastor  anything  they    earn  such  as  the  money  from    personal    work,                     kindergarten,  laboratory,  etc.  Father,  this  is  against  justice.  The  gospel  says                     clearly  that  \"the  laborer  is  worth  his  wage!\"  (Lk.    l0,  7).  If  we  cannot    enter                     Padua  at  better  conditions,    the  time  to  enter    has  not  come  yet  for  us;  we                     renounce and continue praying.                           And we prayed until l948!                          He was very demanding that our communities keep to the terms agreed  upon                     with the pastors.  The sisters sometimes had  a  few dissensions  with the pastor                     of Torregrotta,  and Father   Messina urged   our founder to  provoke  measures                     from the chancery  office. But   he  answered,   \"I  sent  the  sisters  to  rise  no                     rival organization;  were such a situation to happen, I would take back the sisters                     immediately.\"(2)                          On February ll,  l927,  the Father opened his last house  at Novara  of Sicily                     under the auspices of Our Lady of Lourdes,  but he  did  not intervene because of         612                     illness which  brought  him  to death.  He  wrote  to the sisters who were moving                     from  San  Pier Niceto  to found the new community,  telling them how they                     should behave with the high priest of Novara.  \"He will welcome you, and you                     must understand your important mission...  Bear in your  mind that  the  high                     priest will take great care of you.  respect  and take advice from him, behaving                     according  to  his  counsel.  Save  our  rules  and  your  perfect  dependence  on  the                     superior general\"  (Vol. 34, page 7l).                          He disapproved that outsiders, benefactors included, live in the  community.                     He  wrote to the Daughters of the  Sacred  Side, \"Even  though  that miss is a                     holy soul,  still it is  unsuitable that lay persons live with the Religious...  The                     inconvenience  of  living  together  comes  with  time.\"  As  to  the  advantages  one                     could hope  from  it,  he adds,  \"Let us seek God and work  righteously without                     placing our trust in creatures, nor in earthly goods, and God will help us\" (Vol.                     38, page 60).","The  Morning  Star  Sisters  had  opened  a  new  institution  in    a  house                     dependent  on a church,  and the Father  suggests  how  to behave.                           As to the Rev. Father rector, hold him in great regard, make over what you                     can,  keep  silent,  pray  that  Jesus  give  him  mild  and  reasonable      feelings.                     Restrain  yourselves  from  criticizing, disapproving,  etc.  while  talking  with                     the  outsiders   or   the oblates.   You  should know that every  word  you say  is                     referred and exagerated,  and  the  devil profit by it to trouble the  waters. Listen                     to none of the outsiders,  nor others, nor the oblates who speak  ill of him;  on the                     contrary,    cut  their  speech  by    saying  that    you  believe  no  word  against  him,                     making them keep  silent. More than often they happen to play two parts;  on one                     hand, they speak ill of him;  on the other hand,  they speak ill of you.  By acting                     with  prudence,  prayer,  respect,  and  meekness  you  can  trust  that  the  Lord  will                     help you win.  As Saint Paul says, we must win evil with good.  I would like to                     warn you of another thing: never speak  aloud among yourselves of the rector,                     because   there  are always   ears hearing,   which refer  your imprudent words!                     ...Pay attention!  Prudence and prayer! Be wise! Give no weapons to  the devil,                     all the more because your situation is very delicate. You are  not entirely in your                     house,  but are living in the midst  of persons who may be better than you, still                     they may be used by the devil  to trouble you,  even without any reason.  Imagine                     if  you give any reason!                                                                                                               613                          He  concludes  with  an exhortation to  trust.  \"If  we  are persecuted  without                     being at fault,  and we respect and pray  for our persecutors,  and return good for                     evil to them, the Lord will defend, look at, and help us triumph\" (Vol. 39, page                     36).                           When  a  new house was opened,  the Father asked  the  other communities  to                     help it at least by furnishing the chapel,  or in other way.  Once the house was                     settled, it should buy things from the  others.  Treating some affairs about God                     and Neighbor, the Father wrote to Mother Nazzarena, \"The rule is that the have-                     not houses must be helped by those which have; but when they have, they must                     pay for exactness and regularity.  Therefore,  send the periodicals to them, and                     enclose the bill\" (Vol. 35, page l47).","8. He accepted human means                              A  sister  writes,  \"The  Father's  leading  motive  was  trust  in  God  and  his                     providence, and almost contempt of human means.\" The word almost points out                     that  trust  in  providence  stood  out,  while  human  means  were  accepted  with                     prudence.    The  Father    said    that  \"Jesus  would  have  not  multiplied  bread  if                     people were able to buy it.\" After appealing to supernatural means,  the Father                     exploited licitly the human ones. For instance, in the trial of Avignone he used                     his    title    of  rank  because  the  judge  had    a    weakness    for  aristocracy;    he                     approached one by one the counselors of the city hall to have the Holy Spirit                     convent;  he  avoided  the  execution  of  the    sectarian    plan    in    Francavilla  by                     taking  the  orphans  to Messina one day before.                          When  the  Father  perceived  that  the  enemies   aimed  at destroying  his                     institution  under the  pretext  of  Francavilla trial,  he wrote to Father Vitale, \"I                     must do what I can to avoid the risk impending on us.  Needless to say that first                     we  pray  and  trust    in    the    Heart  of  Jesus.    But    we    must    cooperate...    the                     institute  for  boys in Francavilla runs the risk to come  to  an end.  Let us adore                     the judgment of God! The Lord draws good  from evil! Let us trust,  and if we                     have to work,  let us do it\" (Vol. 3l, page 6). And he did so effectively. By night                     he took the boys to  Messina  and  shortly  after went to Rome  to  clear  things,        614                     approaching    the    minister  General  Spingardi,    who  had    been    the  officer                     commanding the fort of Messina.                          In the controversy with Msgr. Razzoli about the Daughters of the Sacred Side,                     one of the sisters charged the Father with  the pretension  to  healing the sick                     through pieces of papers  having written the name of Jesus.  See how the Father                     exculpates himself from the charge.                           This is a distortion of things. I never replaced the work of the  doctors with                     the pieces of papers of the most holy Heart  of Jesus.  It would have been a grave                     act of imprudence, temerity, and superstition, which I never","did,  thanks to  God.  Ordinary doctors  and  specialists in various diseases such                     as  for   eyes,  throat,   and  ears   serve  my  institutes.  They are   paid   yearly.                     Recently,  I  took a Daughter of the Sacred Side at the clinic of Doctor D'Erchia,                     in Bari,  for a surgery which ended with  happy results,  thanks  to  God,  and for                     which I paid more than  l,200 liras.  However, besides using human means we                     resort to pieces of papers of the most holy Heart of Jesus and more frequently of                     his most  holy  Name in grave cases.  We have  experienced  wonderful effects.                     Two   Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  were  healed   from inveterate,  grave sickness                     by the use of such papers. The report was made in Naples by the periodical of                     Don Paoloni,  The  Zealot of  the  Most  Holy  Name of Jesus,  who  specified                     which    human  remedies  were  used  and  that  the  Name  of  Jesus  made  them                     effective (S.C. Vol. 7, page 2l2).                           Writing to the Morning Star Sisters he recommends trust, and above  all  good                     behavior.  \"We  must  double our  trust  in  God, prayer, and holy behavior to                     move the heart of God!...\" (Vol. 39, page 38). Another time, after suggesting to                     the  sisters  how  to  be  energetic    in  order  to  develop  their  institution,    he                     concludes, \"Pay  full attention to my words! God is infinitely rich and  can draw                     money  from the rocks,  but he wants  your  cooperation!... 'Help  yourself that I                     will help you,' says the Lord.  The  older sisters should pray,  and the young ones                     should work,  walk,  and tire themselves!\" (Vol. 39, page 64).                                                                                                               615                          The  Father  wants  always  to  combine  trust  in  God,  prayer,  and  cooperation                     according  to one's own capacity.   Talking  of  the appointments, he insists upon                     this subject.                           We have to receive any task from God and the most holy Virgin's hands with                     faith and love,   resolutely   minding  to  fulfill  it   with   attention, intelligence,                     and  care....We have already said that each person has  to  accomplish  her  task                     not  only  diligently,   but  also intelligently,  understanding  and   performing                     everything  well. Dull, idiot minds will never fulfill even the simplest task well,                     whereas  an  intelligent mind  may always open to  the  light  of grace.  For that                     reason, please do not accept dull persons in the community.  However,  those                     who for lack of intelligence do  not know how to cope in singular cases, must                     learn  to  help  themselves  through  remote  and  present  prayer,  which  will  be  of                     great help if they  have   received  the task with joy and a resolute  mind  to                     succeed.  Each  one  has  to  help  herself  with  prayer.  When  one  finds  herself  in                     doubt or perplexity,  besides calling upon Jesus' name she  should resort to the                     Mother of Good Counsel, by  saying  for instance,  \"Mother of good counsel, for                     Jesus' sake, your beloved son,  please enlighten me on how to behave,  how to                     resolve,\"  or the  like.  The invocation to the Mother of Good Counsel has been                     always effective beyond belief because it opens even the  dullest minds.  Some                     people  do not fulfill their tasks exactly","because  they  have  not  received  the  assignment  from  obedience  with  joy,    a                     resolute    mind,    and  faith,    but  also  because  they  neglect  remote  and  present                     prayer.  For  that  reason,  they  cannot  lay  the  blame  on  incapacity,  but  on  their                     negligence (Vol. l, page l23).                           Obviously, the person appointed to an office must be somehow prepared   and                     skilled,   otherwise  everything  is   based   on presumption.                          During the l9l5-l8 war Brother Maurus died in Oria, and none replaced  him                     as an internal combustion engine expert.  It was  a misfortune  because  a  few                     Religious of  ours  would  lose  the exemption  from  military  service if the  shoe                     factory  stopped working.  Father Palma appointed another brother to that job,                     but when  he  began working he was unable to make the  engine  start, Father                     Palma's prayers notwithstanding.  At a certain point  the Servant of God said,                     \"Father Palma, prayer is good, but does the brother  know how to keep the engine                     going?\"   \"Father,  he is  a beginner!\"  said  Father Palma.   \"Then,\" the  Father                     concluded, \"send for the instructor; we cannot pretend miracles!\"                          At the beginning of the war, the Father mailed a circular to the   communities                     instructing   them   how   to   behave   with correspondence  submitted to the                     board of censors.  After stating beforehand that the letters are opened, he points                     out that if the news about war may cause danger,  the law intervenes against  the                     authors of the letters.  Then he warns, \"The undersigned director warmly  exhorts                     this community to abstain from transmitting  news which  could be censured by             616                     the  board  of  censors  and  could    cause  penalty.\"  Then  he  asks  them  \"to                     acknowledge  receipt  of  the  letter  and  to  follow  the  rules.\"  Finally  he  writes,                     \"Keep this document in the archives\" (S.C.  Vol.  5,  page 3l). To Father Vitale,                     \"We must  pay attention to how formulating telegrams,  because  today even the                     most innocent words give suspicion\" (Vol.  32, page 73). After  the breaking of                     the front at Caporetto,  the Father renews his  exhortation to the sisters in Padua.                     \"I don't know  whether the  letters will be submitted to the board of censors in                     Padua. However  it may be,  it is the same for us,  because  our  mutual writing                     conforms  to  the  religious,    civil,  patriotic  principles.  Needless    to  recommend                     you  to  write  clearly  in  order  to  avoid  any  misunderstanding    about    innocent                     wordings.  I hope  that  I  am understood\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page 25l).","The  correspondence  with  Saint  Anthony's  devotees,    who    were  waiting    for                     grace  from the saint through the  prayers  of  the orphans,  was  entrusted  to the                     sisters.  The Father  recommends great  prudence to them.  \"Pay attention on how                     to write  to  the devout;  do  not promise graces and miracles,  but give them hope                     that  if  the matter is according to the will of God and  to  the good of the soul,                     etc. Be careful!\" (Vol. 34, page 38).                         9. People did not succeed in cheating him                              Let us see more details.                          We read in a report,  \"On the whole I noticed no  imprudence in the Father\".                     Another relation says, \"I am under the impression that  he had not much human                     prudence.  I heard saying that he was often  cheated  in  his affairs.\" This is  the                     impression   of  a person, but owing to other evidences and deeds we can count                     on, I think it is not justified.                          The  Servant  of God made his major purchases after  hearing the  experts  and                     above all the  ecclesiastical  superiors.  Says Father  Vitale,  \"One day I showed        617                     my disagreement  to  him,  who responded, 'I did so by advice of the bishop'.\" A                     Daughter of the Sacred  Side reports,  \"Before founding a new house,  even of                     our  congregation,  he  acted  very  prudently,  reaching  an  agreement  with  the                     ecclesiastical and civil authorities.\"                          Says Lawyer Crisafulli,  \"I knew the Servant of God since  I was  a  child  and                     admired him for his virtue.  When I  became  a lawyer,  I  often  welcomed him                     in my house because  he  felt  to consult  me  any time he had  to perform an                     administrative  deed, even though he had already consulted other lawyers.\"                          While treating affairs, the Father did not act with complete confidence.                          For  instance,  when  the  Father was going to  rebuild  the church of the Holy                     Spirit after the l908 earthquake,  he made the decision to keep the walls of the                     church safe against the opinion  of  the  engineer and the contractor,  notifying                     the  matter  to Father  Vitale  in  these  terms:","I inform you that both the engineer and the contractor were planning to                     raze the walls of the church.  The latter said  that the  walls had nothing artistic,                     but I opposed their  scheme  so they  agreed upon chaining the walls.  Please tell                     them to  avoid the practice of the Civil Engineers who by nature are inclined to                     demolish  and  to reconstruct everything at whomever's  expenses! What  a  good                     job the engineer would like to do!  Protest  on  my behalf! The walls are artistic.                     If we raze them, the Ministry of Education  has  no reason to help us  financially.                     Besides,  the director of monuments  wants to save the walls!  (Vol.  32,  page                     38).                           Let  us quote Msgr.  Farina's opinion about the purchase  of the house for the                     Daughters  of  the  Sacred  Side  at  Spinazzola.  \"On  that  occasion  I  admired  the                     prudence of the Servant of  God,  who eluded  the  exaggerated pretension of the                     sellers who  aimed  at taking  advantage  from  the  urgent purchase on  behalf  of                     the sisters and the bishop.\"                          A  very  simple  case  shows  the  Father's    far-sightedness.    The  September-                     October l9ll water bill seems to be high, and he writes to the mother-superior,                     \"How does it come if we are using the old water  since August first?  They say                     that the water meter of  the engine reads it.  But,  did we have the engine for                     water in those months?  Was  it exact?  Or did people introduce new water in the                     pipes of the  old one?  Check everything before paying the  bill\" (Vol. 35, page          618                     84).                          In  the  purchasing  of the Avignone houses the  Father  was taken by the                     throat,  but he was not cheated. The institution was born in that cursed land, and                     that  land  the  Father  had  to  redeem;  therefore  he  had  to  buy  it.    Aware  of  the                     situation,  the  owners claimed  a sentimental value.  The Father had to play with                     them, but he knew of their speculation.                          Finally, the Father succeeded to buy the little houses \"at a very high price, a                     thousand liras each, when the normal price was about 300\" (S.C.  Vol. l, page                     27l).                          At  a  certain  point the owners showed an interest  in  the auction sale.  The                     Father appealed to prayer, and wrote to Father Vitale,                           Make  people  pray  the six novenas  to  ask  the  Lord  for enlightenment and                     help...    prayer  and  sound  advice  of  experts  are  needed    if    we  are  obliged  to                     participate in the  auction...  Pay very careful attention that they make no fun of                     us.  Because this place is in the very center of the","new Messina,  people  could easily  converge to the auction,   and buy it at a high                     price  by mutual  consent with Ando' and Pino (the owners).  They  wouldn't care                     about upsetting us (Vol. 32, page 96).                           In  such cases one must accept things just as they  are,  and the Servant of God                     wrote to Father Vitale,  \"Give him what he  is asking  for! Never mind.  What we                     buy for the Lord at high  price yields  very  much spiritually and temporally!\"                     (Vol.  33,  page l37).                          Some days later he insists,  \"Buy the little houses  without minding the price\"                     (Vol. 33, page l4l).                          The Avignone houses worried the Father until his last years. Marquis  Bruno                     Anthony    built  them  in  several  rows  on    his    land  around  l840.    The  Father                     bought all of them step by step,  paying very dear. After a peaceful possession of                     about twenty years, one of the heirs claimed that the streets were not sold,  and                     he took legal action.  The case reached the supreme court.  Finally,  the Father's                     right to the ownership of the streets was  acknowledged definitively.                          Let us see how the Father behaved in this case.                          First of all,  Avignone acted in bad faith.  I was told that he had said, \"Even                     though I lose the cause, Canon Di Francia will make  me  pay nothing.\" He  was                     speculating.  In  fact,   because  Avignone  was in bad financial situation,   the                     Father helped  him during and after the cause.                                            619                          To  defend  himself,  the  Father resorted  to  natural  and supernatural means.                     Beginning with the last ones, he appointed a celestial court,  whose chairman was                     Saint Michael the archangel. Judges,  lawyers,  counselors,  etc., were chosen                     from angels and saints.  The  souls  of purgatory were  the  assistant,  praying,                     hoping,  and  influential public.  We said particular prayers  to them (Vol. 5, page                     l08).(3)                          Obviously,    the  Father  did  not  pretend  miracles;    therefore,  he  chose  the                     lawyers  to  whom  he  submitted  documents,  information,  and  explanation.                     Lawyer Romano remembers, \"I was a counselor for the  defense  in the cause                     against Avignone.  The Father  was  so imperturbable,   having  all  his  trust  in                     God.    But    in    this  circumstance  he  also  took  advice  from  other  lawyers  of                     Messina.\"","10. The government of a daring                             We    glean    some  judgments  upon  the  Father's  government    from  various                     relations.  \"The government of the Servant of God was  a government of a saint,                     or better yet, of an imprudent person. He was a daring who trusted in Providence                     limitlessly.\"                          The Father's charity stood out over everything and made  him overlook  some                     human  expedients while  practicing  this  virtue heroically.  He  was  like  an                     eagle with  the  charity's  golden feathers,  and  he was held and revered by the                     citizens  as    such.  Human    prudence  was  lacking  in  him  because  it  was                     overwhelmed  by faith  and  charity.  \"I  never  noticed any  imprudence  in  his                     behavior  because  his  endless trust in  God  cannot  be  called imprudence.\"                     \"He   was  not  at  all  cut  out  for   financial administration;  his arithmetic was                     not  human.\"  \"I  think  that    he  was  always  well-balanced,  doing  everything                     according to the means at  his disposal.  But when the will of God was known,                     he    threw  himself    in    God's    arms  running  his  way.\"      \"His    heady    actions                     depended on charity;  if he met an abandoned child in the street, a vacancy in his                     institute was to be found.\"                          To  value the charges of imprudence against the  Father,  we have to value the                     above evidences.                                                                                                               620                          \"Now and then imprudent,  he undertook enterprises surpassing his   means;                     but  since  he  confided  in  God,    the  impossible  turned  out  to  be  reality.  I  still                     remember Canon Vitale once exclaiming, 'Holy Father! Holy Father!' because of                     a charitable pledge of the Servant of God which seemed to be absurd,  but for the                     Servant of God was nothing, or almost nothing. In fact, the same Can. Vitale by                     experience added,  'The Lord remedies everything!' There were no  limits  to the                     Servant  of  God's  charity,    and  he    would    have  faced    any  work,    even  the                     building of Milan's major hospital  in Messina.\"                           The find of means for maintaining an institution is of a great","importance,  and  we know how the Father sweated  for  it; that, however, is not                     the main problem. The Father opens his mind on  this  subject while writing  to                     Msgr.  Zimarino,  bishop  of Gravina. \"In these institutions the problem of the                     means  is  third  on    the  list.    First  we  need  the  spiritual  work,    i.e.,    the  pure                     intention,    the  spirit  of  faith  and  sacrifice,    the  love  for    our  Lord  and  our                     neighbor. We must work to make these things reign in the  institution  as much as                     we can,  because human failings  are always  with us.  Second,  we need the                     ecclesiastical    approval,  i.e.,      we    must    act    in    conformity    with    the                     ecclesiastical authorities,  with  their blessing, and depending on them. Third, is                     finance,  viz.,  the means, administration, works, industries, etc.  It goes without                     saying that we must work.  \"Pray and work.\" If  we look after the kingdom of                     God  and  his  justice,    working  to  earn  our  living  with  the  sweat  of  our  brow,                     means  cannot  fail. Everything  can  fail,  but the word of God.\" He  confesses,                     \"My little  institutions went forward without cash in hand for  about 30 years,                     and we have seen the providence's miracles\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page l62).                          Msgr.  Razzoli  described the Father as  an  impressionable, impulsive,   over-                     hasty    decision    making    person.    Msgr.    Farina  responds,    \"I    think    that                     necessary fortitude and  quickness  of decision  was mistaken for impulsivity.                     The  Servant  of  God  was  a  reflecting  prudent  man  who  also  took  advice  from                     others.\"                          A  specific  charge  was about the  number  of  children  he sheltered.  One  of                     the  older  sisters  remembers,  \"Sheltering orphaned  boys and girls in the early        621                     times,  when facilities and means  were  lacking,  is an example to be avoided.  It                     was    our  despair.    Only    when    the    sisters  began    attending    to    it,    the                     inconvenience was remedied.\"                          If  the  Father  should  have made  things  perfect  at  the beginning of the                     institution, the institute wouldn't have been                     born.  The Father responds to this charge:                           The  people  say  that  I  shelter  children  too  easily.      They  do  not    know  the                     moral pressure under which I find myself more  than often.  Today it is an high                     ranking person pleading for a  child, tomorrow  a  representative of the public                     press  interceding  for another child,   then it is a benefactor pretending to shelter                     an abandoned  little  girl.  Ironically,  the  same person  who  has criticized me                     for accepting children too readily,  is the one who will later insist that I take one                     that  he  recommends.    To    refuse  is  embarrassing,  for  who  can  refuse  a  bare-                     footed, sad-eyed child who seems to be saying to the sister,  \"I have no mother,                     take me with you!\" (Vol. 45, page 447).","On  a  certain occasion,  the Father wrote to the  mayor  of Oria,                      \"Quite  a  few  persons told me that I throw  myself  into accepting  orphans                     without  calculating  income  and   expenses. Perhaps  they  are right.  That's the                     sort  of  man  I  am.    I  am    so  deeply  concerned  with  saving  the  abandoned  or                     unsafe orphans that I  cannot always refrain myself from sheltering them,  nor                     can    I  take    the    compass  of  the  cold  wary  person!\"  Then  he    appeals    to                     providence. \"Finally I think that the sanctity of the institution requires a divine                     and human providence,  on condition that we  do all our work\" (Vol. 4l, page                     93). It follows that the last resort was always the help of the Lord.                          Sometimes  circumstances were demanding,  as in the case  of the  house in                     Trani.    In  the  presence  of  the  archbishop's  anxiety  the    Father  refrained  from                     accepting the orphans of the  cholera; but later,  it was the same archbishop who                     asked to increase  the number of the orphans.                          Another  charge  concerned the prayers.  \"I think  that  the Father went to                     extremes in the prayers,  which were lenthy during the day. For the remnant, he                     demanded what we were able to do, as I  realized from his soothing Melanie's                     harshness.  Perhaps,  she was testing our vocation.\"                          When we treated the topic of prayer,  we have specified  the Father's  thought.                     When I was a student of high school in  Oria, every  day  we  said  the long form                     of the prayers  to  win  good workers,  and it was somehow heavy for us students.                     Father Vitale submitted  the  case  to the  Servant  of  God,  who  immediately           622                     substituted  it  with  the short form,  leaving the long  one  to Sundays  and feasts.                     He himself revised the  prayers,  shortened them, and informed the communities:                           From  the  beginning  of  the  Pious  Institution  we  have  abounded  in    saying                     prayers.  Due to the labors and  engagements  of  our houses,  as well as to the                     idea that some prayers may be replaced by meditation and spiritual reading for a                     better formation of the spirit,  we  have  deemed  to exclude some vocal prayers                     and  to shorten  other  ones.  We  did  so not  only  to  avoid  lack  of recollection                     in  saying  them,    but  also  because  novenas,    triduos,  and  spiritual  readings                     sometimes fall in the same time.   To pray all of them, we would have to rush                     (Vol. 34, page l83).                           The last charge concerns the administration.                          \"Even  though  his  administrative  behavior  may  be  excused  by  his  endless                     charity and his simplicity in believing in the","kindness  of  people,    I  don't  think  that  he  has  been    prudent    in  administering                     money.  In  the  early times he directed  the  two institutes and their houses, and                     things didn't go well because of his simplicity and kindness... I specify that the                     wrong consisted in running into debts, as well as in exploitation from laymen and                     not-laymen,  who  baffled his sacrifice for  long .\" So states  a witness.                          Let  us  read how the Servant of God defended  himself  from this charge in                     the l906 speech.                           This  grave  detrimental  charge  urges  me  to  answer.    First    of  all,    the                     accountant of my institute records in detail the income and the expenses every                     day.  Everyone is free to check them! What more do we have to do?  I know that                     we should improve,  and  with the  help  of  the  Lord  I aim at achieving  the                     ideals  of  my institute,  which began from nothing in the slums of the poor  by                     saving    abandoned  children  and  suffering  people.    We  have  already  two                     orphanages  which  draw the liking  and  the  admiration  of Messina citizens.                     Why do they speak of bad administration?                          When a household or a factory goes bankrupt, its good income and  revenues                     notwithstanding,  we  say  that it's  due  to  bad administration.  On the contrary,                     quite the opposite happened to us.  Without almost any means, we have always                     gone ahead, holding orphans   and  poor,   and  improving  our  private  and                     public  undertaking.    We  heartily  love  order,    system,  and  regularization  of                     everything  because we know that order comes  from  God,  who arranged  the               623                     chaos  in  weight  and  measure.    In  spite  of    that    we  have  faced  for  years  the                     charge that we have no administration in our institutes.                           The  Servant of God did not confine himself to defending his administration,                     but launched an attack.                           Let  me  now  retort  a  charge.    Even  though  they  are  said  to  be  well                     administered,  how  are many houses  doing?  What  are  the miracles  of certain                     administrative minds?  Why is bankruptcy  on the daily agenda, even for persons                     having ledgers and accountants in  order?  Why are superfluous expenses to the                     prejudice of  the budget? Why does greed to increase riches push the people to                     risk big capitals?  A few years ago, a gentleman of Messina made heavy remarks                     on  my administration,  and opposed the increase of  the yearly  contribution to                     my institute by the city hall  by  saying that  I do  not know how to administer.                     Was  that  a  good  means  to  help  my  institute's  inmates  and  to  remedy  my  bad                     administration?  It  is  a simple way to give me no money.  So,  my incapacity  to                     administer remains in potency,  and cannot be put into  practice. Well,  shortly                     after,    through  a  fit  of  administrative  mind  that  gentleman  got  mixed  up  in  a                     contract,  losing 200,000 to  300,000 liras!  I could say the full name of the late                     gentleman, but I don't, out of respect","for his family.  And then, woe if Canon Di Francia  spends five liras to prepare a                     soup for poor people  who are  starving! Should I spend that money on luxury                     articles,  in such a case I had nothing to respond...\" (Vol. 45, page 463).                           When  the  Father  confines himself to \"the holy  virtue  of prudence in its                     degrees of reason and faith,\" his reasoning makes sense,  but when he enters the                     field of \"extraordinary faith\" (V. no.  4)  we  must acknowledge that the common                     sense  has  no  go. Besides, the Father himself writes to Msgr. Parrillo (Ch. l6,                     no. 5)  that  his  behavior is somehow strange,  because he  had  the presumption                     to    financially  help    others,    without    waiting    for  tomorrow,    trusting  in  this                     divine promise, \"If you give one, you will receive a hundred times more,\" and                     \"give to others,  and God will  give to you:  you will receive a full measure,  a                     generous helping, poured into your hands - all that you can hold\"  (Lk. 6, 38).                     Who  can  condemn a man who lives in full this page of  the gospel?                          One  relation hints at the Father's financial  behavior.  \"I think that the Father                     lacked prudence while helping his  neighbor, because  he  was  generous with                     everyone  knocking    at    his    door,  making  no  discrimination.    I  once  took  the                     liberty of telling him my  point of view,  because the petitioner was a drunkard                     and  a gambler.  He responded,  \"I know nothing of that.  They ask and I have to                     give!\" The witness did not catch the strength of \"I have to give.\" Charity almost         624                     compelled him to give.                          Father  Carmel  realized the Father's soul on  this  subject more than once.                           I    often    submitted  the  ledgers  to  him,    pointing    out    that  expenses  were                     higher than income. Consequently, we had to balance them to avoid bankruptcy.                     But he responded to me,  'That's fine, my son.  Mathematics is right.  But,  if we                     had  to  follow  it,    we  would  do  nothing.  Therefore,  we  have  to  follow  the                     mathematics of faith. With that, we'll never be in trouble'.\" A sister concludes her                     relation  with  this short  significant  statement,  \"As  to charity,  the Father did                     not  follow  human  prudence:  he  trusted  in  God  only,    and  achieved  his  goals                     through him.\" Whoever trusts in God, will be never confounded!","11. Simplicity                          The  gospel combines simplicity with prudence.  Read how the Father combines                     them in his rules:                           The  principles  of  religious   virtue  requires  that  one practices simplicity of                     heart and avoids  simulation,  duplicity, and hypocrisy toward God and neighbor.                     Avoidance of rash judging anyone  and the disposition to justify or regard the                     failings  of others  with  indulgence  also belong to  holy  simplicity.  This virtue                     does not lead one to disapprove of the orders of obedience or to condemn the                     actions  of  others,  but  disposes  them  to  look  on  everything  as  good  through  a                     child's belief.                          Simplicity is also characterized by prudence to which our Lord Jesus Christ                     pointed:  \"You must be as cautious as serpents and as gentle as doves\" (Mt.  l0,                     l6).  This  celestial,  purest prudence differs from the worldly prudence and the                     human respect. Even though it sees everything with simplicity,  still  it judges                     between good and evil as they really are before God.                          Holy simplicity abhors lies.  Behaving frankly and sincerely according to the                     divine oracle \"yes, no,\" each congregant will avoid the spirit of falsehood as if it                     were  a  pest  of  the  soul.  Not    to  expose  simplicity  and  sincerity  to  risk,    the   625                     congregants will  almost  never  make use  of  compound  mental  abstraction,                     preferring   to  conceal  through  silence  what  is  useless  to manifest (Vol. 3,                     page 22).                           Unintentionally,    through  these  words  the  Father  gives  us    a  portrait  of                     himself.                          Father Francis Fazio,  S. J., profiles the Servant of God in a few lines.                           Canon  Di  Francia  was  really  animated  by   supernatural principles.  He                     was  a  man  of  God,  imbued  with  piety  and  devotion,  always  acting                     supernaturally.  His characteristic  features were: first,  a great simplicity, like                     that of a good boy who is unable to  think  ill  of  anyone,  but prone to see                     everyone    good    as  himself.    The    second  was  a  sovereign  one:    a    heartfelt                     charity  which  was  the  source  of  his  works.    Third,    love  of  many  prayers.  In                     short, he was a saint of inner, simple life very connatural to him, which he lived                     in the charity for the unfortunates. One day, he  told me with the candor of a                     child who smiles without  pride: \"I am in the heart of everybody.\"","Father Anthony Di Coste, a Redemptorist, wrote,                           \"The    spirit    of    the    Servant    of  God    was    the    spirit    of  simplicity  and                     infancy,    which  animated  the  Seraph  of  Assisi,  the  saint  of  Sales,    and  Saint                     Teresa of the child   Jesus.  Ingenuous and   enemy  of any double-dealing and                     falsehood,  he was open  and meek like a child... that was Canon Di Francia.\"                           In  l945,    when  a  street  of  Oria  was  dedicated  to  Hannibal  M.  Di  Francia,                     Msgr.    Di  Tommaso  recalled  some  of  the  circumstances  which    followed  the                     purchase of Saint Paschal convent,  36  years before.  The  business was cared by                     the bishop and the owner  Don Nicholas  Salerno  Mele'.  The owner reserved the                     hunting to  the thrushes in the convent's garden as an indispensable condition to                     the  selling  of  his  property.    After  a  long  insistence,  the  bishop  succeeded    to                     eliminate such a condition,  but at the end of  the dealing,  the  Father came in                     and the owner renewed his claim  to the hunting by saying:                          \"Everything    is  fine,    but  his  Excellence  does  not    want    to  give  in  to  a                     condition.                          - Which one?  Said the Father.                          - The hunting to the thrushes in the garden of the convent.                          - But we don't care the thrushes, you can do that.                                   626                          - But  the canon does not know of the huntresses,  said  the bishop.                          - Huntresses?  Exclaimed the Father.                          - Yes,  huntresses,   said the bishop,  because his wife and daughters along                     with their friends would come...                          - That  is  not possible,   remarked the Father,  who  added  with  simplicity,                     \"We  can do that...  We  catch  the  thrushes ourselves, and will send them to                     your house...\"                          Don Nicholas was interested in the trip and the hunting, not in the thrushes.                     And  yet,  amazing  at  the  Father's  simplicity,  he  renounced  the  condition  (Per                     l'inaugurazione della Via A.  M. Di Francia, page 49).                          Father  Vitale writes:                           Wanting  everyone  in  his  communities  to  seek  God  alone    after  his    own                     examples and teaching,  it was much to his  satisfaction when  he met simple                     people who did not care about worldly things. He thought that","these people attracted God's blessings  for  the foundation.                          The Father taught:  \"He who seeks God, is humble, simple--docile; he does                     not deceive, nor simulate; he is not a liar, but rather he stands in the superior's                     hand like warm wax to be molded\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 3l0).                           The last time the Servant of God was in Oria,  a probationer asked him for a                     reminder, and he answered, \"Yes, yes; no, no.\"                          It  is  understood that the Father liked the  meeting   with simple souls.                          In  those   days,  Brother Joseph Ghezzi  (l872-l955)   of  the Friars  Minor                     lived in Apulia  in  humility,  simplicity,  self-denial,  and love. He accepted from                     God suffering of the body and soul,  building  his  sanctification in peace  and                     silence.  The people  held him as a saint because of his extraordinary  virtues                     sometimes substantiated by miracles.  The Father too held him  in high  esteem,                     and used to call upon him in Manduria to enjoy the conversation of his simple                     soul enamored of God.  Even though  he was of the very noble dukes of Lecce,                     and the bishop of that city had  invited  him to join the clergy,  he entered the                     Franciscan order  as a lay-brother,  after his graduation  from  liceo.   He  worked                     as a mendicant friar  in favor of the Franciscan missions for several decades and                     edified the people with his work.                          A  significant   episode of a different kind is narrated  by Father  Franze' of                     the Friars Minor,  who made the Father  laugh. Father  Franze'  related how he                     converted  Mecio,  a  university porter at the anatomy theater.  He was a good            627                     man  deeply  attached  to  his  family  and  office,    but  very  ignorant  in  religion.                     Father Franze'  was a medical student and for a year he instructed Mecio enough                     to  make  him receive holy Communion.  Let  us  hear  his relation:                           The    piety    of  Mecio  in  his  first  meeting  with    God    in    the  Eucharist                     exceeded  my  expectation.  Contrite and  absorbed  in prayer,  he thanked the                     Lord by reading in the prayer book that I had given him that morning.  I was                     amazed and satisfied.  I  left him in prayer and went to prepare a rich breakfast                     for him. After about an hour Mecio did not appear yet.  Now and then,  I checked                     in the church and saw him always in prayer, but I did not disturb him. When the                     masses were over and the faithful went out, the man came in, his eyes beaming                     with joy.  \"Why did you stay so long in the church?\"  I asked him. His answer                     made me gape at him. He had received  holy  Communion at every mass and had                     read the most  he could  in the prayer book without any distinction whether he                     was reading the novena of the dead or the blessing of Saint  Brigid's scapular.","When I recounted the happening to the Father, he laughed and said,  \"To                     be lodged,  the Lord found a very simple and innocent soul!  These  ignorant                     souls  gain more  than  we  do  with  our science!\" (Bulletin, May-June l947,                     page 72).                           However,    the    Father's  simplicity  did  not  refrain  him    from  defending  his                     ideas.                          For  instance,  when the Messina chief police officer  asked the Servant of                     God to shelter the fatherless boy of his maid, the Father  answered that he was                     unable to shelter the boy in Messina because  he  had surpassed too much the age                     required  by  rules. However,  \"for  the  great  esteem  in  which  he  held  all  the                     authorities\"    he  would  receive  the  boy  in  Oria.    The  officer felt  offended  and                     called  the  Father  by  telephone,    talking    vehemently  and  angrily.    The  Father                     wrote to him, \"Mr. Chief Police officer, I  think I can do no more to show my                     deference to  you.  Besides, you must consider that I am a priest who cannot be                     weak in matter  of conscience. On this subject, I would say the same thing to his                     majesty the king,  who would admire and praise me\" (S.C.  Vol. 5, page l93).                     The officer kept silent.                          To  help  his children improve in the way of  the  spiritual infancy,  the  Father                     wrote  during the  l9l9  Christmas  novena Proposals  and  Prayers  to  the  Child                     Jesus  to  Become  Again Children.  By  examining 25 main features of children                     in  honor  of  our    Lord's    birth,    the    Father  writes    that    \"children    believe   628                     everything,  have no grudge,  do and think of what their  parents want,  love their                     relatives,  etc.\" Then he addresses a prayer to the  divine child to adorn the souls                     with the children's  virtues and to strengthen them with perseverance.                              Notes                              (l)  Perhaps prudence was the virtue that the Father had  to practice that year.","(2) I have read both the letter to Father Messina and to the pastor of Padua.  However, we don't                     have any copy. The quotations are from the notes I was keeping since long.                           (3)  We report a witty remark of the Father.  The lawyers of the celestial court were Saint                     Francis of Sales,  Saint Alphonsus M.  Liguori,  and Saint Francis of Paola.  Father Drago made                     the humorous  remark that Saint Francis of Paola was not at the right place on the side of Saint                     Francis  of  Sales  and  Saint    Alphonsus,  because  they  were  teachers  of  law...  The  Father                     responded,  \"Saint  Alphonsus    represents  the  law;    Saint  Francis  of  Sales,    meekness  and                     persuasion.  If law and reason are not enough,  Saint Francis of  Paola comes in with his stick to                     put things in  order...\"  It was  an allusion to the Roman dialect wisecrack,  \"Quanno ce vo', ce                     vo'...\" (What is required, is required).                                                                                                                             629","630","20                                                                                      JUSTICE                                              l.

To each, his own                              Justice is  often  synonymous of holiness  in  the  sacred Scripture,  as  in  the                     saying of the Lord,  \"Blest are they  who hunger and thirst for holiness;  they                     shall have their fill\" (Mt. 5,  6).  Justice encompasses all the virtues.  When we                     say    \"The  saints  are  just,\"  we      mean  that.    Here,    however,    with  the  word                     \"justice\"  we mean the supernatural virtue infused by God in  the soul,  which                     inclines  the will always to give the  people  what belongs to them.                          After  prudence,  justice  is the most excellent  among  the cardinal virtues.                     But it is inferior to the theological  virtues and  to some others which originate                     from  them,    such  as  religion,  because  they  have  a  more  immediate  and  noble                     object.                          Justice  regulates  our  duties  toward  our  neighbor;    religion,  our  relationship                     with God. The virtue of religion is very near to justice, but is not justice in the                     strict sense of the term since justice requires that each receive his own. Because a                     creature is unable to give God all the respect he is worthy of, religion does not                     realize all the conditions of justice.  It  is,  however,  a potential part of it, like                     gratitude for the benefits we receive, and obedience,  which regulates the duties                     toward the  superiors.                          We  have  already treated the Father's virtue  of  religion; therefore,  we  refer    632                     to the chapters in which we  have  written about his piety,  devotion,  spirit of                     prayer,  attention  to  avoid  the      least    defects,      and    engagement    to    fulfill                     everything  perfectly.  He  did  so  to  perform    the  will  of  God  for  the  greatest                     consolation of Jesus' Heart.                          Now  let  us  listen  to new evidences  which  disclose  the Father's soul on the                     subject of justice.","2. He was upright with God                              The  virtue  of  justice  requires  first  the  observance  of  God's  law.    We    can                     realize the Father's faithfulness to divine law  in the chapter about his love for                     God,  hatred for sin,  and care to avoid it at any cost.                          Those  who  have known the Servant of God form  a  choir  of praise  with                     their bearing witness on his uprightness with  God. \"He  was very observant of                     God's law.\"  \"I never saw him  failing in  his religious duties.\"  \"The Father's life                     was  a  continuous immolation for the Lord, and he pledged himself always to                     fulfill  the  commandments  in  the best way he was able to.\"  I  have  no doubt                     that he fulfilled the precepts and the counsels of the Lord very faithfully all his                     life long,  because I verified in him the purest  intention  in   everything.  He                     served God  with  all  his strength.\"                          We  have said that when he visited our  houses,  we   welcomed him  with                     clapping  of hands,  and the first thing  he  did  was inviting  us to go to the                     chapel  with  him  to  greet  the  \"Owner    of  the    house.\"    He    never    considered                     himself    the    owner    of    his  foundations.  The  Lord  and  Our  Lady  were  the                     absolute owners.                          When  people  go  up the main stairs of Saint  Paschal's  in Oria, they see on                     the wall the pictures of the most holy Heart of Jesus  and  Mary.  The Father             633                     exposed them the same day  we  took possession,  on  September  28,  l909.  He                     wrote under  both  the pictures,  \"I  am the owner of this house and of those who                     dwell and love me.\"                          On  a  cover of documents of the house of  Rome,  he  wrote, \"Papers of our                     building,  which belongs to the Heart of Jesus and Mary,  Saint Joseph,  Saint                     Anthony, Saint Michael the archangel, and all saints, in Rome\" (Vol. 43, page                     9l4).","3. In the house of God                            Coming  to  details,  we point out the Father's  very  great respect for the holy                     place.                          He wrote:                           I recognize that I must be a model for everyone  everywhere, but above all in                     the church because it is the Lord's house.                          Before  entering  the Lord's house I will remember the  Holy Spirit's saying:                     \"When you enter the Lord's house,  take care of your  steps.\" I will not enter it                     hastily and rashly,  but  at  a sedate  and recollected pace,  making the sign of the                     cross    with  holy    water.    Then    I    will    genuflect,    adoring    the   most    Holy                     Sacrament.    When    I    pass    before  the    holy    tabernacle,    I    will  genuflect                     reverently and recollectedly.                          While kneeling in church I can rest my hands on the chair or the  pew  and my                     forehead on my hands in order to concentrate  my thoughts,  but without leaning                     against  the  chair  or  the  pew.  Calm  and  recollected,    I  will  not  engage  in                     conversation with  anyone; only  when  obliged by necessity I will speak in a low                     voice  and briefly.                          During the prayer in common I will pray with a low, contrite voice;  when  the       634                     rule or necessity lets us sit,  I will  do  so decorously and modestly.                          So  that my external behavior in church be well-regulated  I will  strive  to be                     recollected in the divine  presence  offering praise,  thanksgiving,  petitions, and                     love to the Lord (Vol. 44, page l2l).                          When the people enter the church or the sacramental  oratory they must pay                     reverence  with  faith,    considering  that  they  are  in  the  presence  of  God,  our                     adorable, beloved Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal  king surrounded by the angels                     and the saints along  with  the  queen  of heaven and earth,  who adore  him                     deeply.  Before entering, each in an attitude of faith, will think of what she  is                     going  to  say  to the supreme goodness in  the  sacrament  while adoring  and                     praying.  It  is written:  \"Before  entering  God's sanctuary,  take  care  of your                     steps and avoid to  be  like  one tempting  God.\"  They  will  be recollected  and                     devout  in  the presence  of God in the sacrament,  will increase their  respect,                     recollection,  devotion,  and  faith during the exposition of the holy host (Vol. l,                     page 99).","Writes Father Vitale:                           In God's house, the padre was at home.                          What  memories! What dignity! He expected the same  type  of behavior from                     us.  Our eyes should look down, our hands should be clasped, and we should not                     make noise. More than once, he stopped children  before  entering the chapel,                     getting  their    attention,  urging    them    to  recollection,    and  with  living    faith                     reminding passages from Holy Scripture:  \"When you enter the temple of God,                     watch your steps; before prayer prepare your soul.\"                          In the evening of holy Saturday in l9l9,  a Religious  could not help laughing                     in the chapel. The padre pointed out that there was   no  temptation stronger  than                     laughing  before  the   Holy Sacrament (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page                     278).                           He demanded  greatest respect and silence in the church.  He was  totally of                     God and absorbed in  him.  Obviously,   he  made  us distinguish   between the                     presence and the absence of the  Blessed Sacrament in the church.  In the last                     case, he allowed somehow to speak aloud, especially in the days preceding July                     first, when we made a radical cleaning. He did so to make us feel the difference                     between the presence and the absence of Jesus in the tabernacle.                          How  he loved decorum in the house of God! Someone  went  up to  say that                     he was exaggerated! \"He perhaps decorated the  house of  God to excess.  Saint            635                     Anthony's  church  proves  it,    because  it  was  heavily  decorated  by  his  will.\"                     Another critic says,  \"Did he provide decorum for the house of the Lord? For my                     taste, a chapel should  have a pretty crucifix between two candles on the  altar.                     For him instead,  who had a soul of a simple child, an altar full of  pictures and                     paintings of any size was  fine.  In  fact,  the walls of his room were covered with                     such things of piety.\" Others judge  differently.  \"He provided the house of the                     Lord with  the magnificence of the decorations.  The churches of the Holy Spirit                     and  Saint  Anthony  in  Messina  prove  it.    Even  though  poor,    he  was  not                     concerned about cost when the decorum in the church,  or the worship  of the                     Eucharist was involved.  Our sisters inherited  a scrupulous care for the cleaning                     of the sacred furnishings.\"  \"He was  so fond of poverty,  but  lavished everything                     he had for the house  of the Lord.  Our church in Messina proves it.\" I came  to                     know  that  during the building of  Saint  Anthony's  temple,  he showed his wish                     that it should be the most splendid.  To tell the truth,  the  Father  wanted the                     temple so  beautiful,  rich,  and pleasant  to help the praying soul talk with God.                     He wanted  the chapels of his houses decorous to the utmost.","\"He  loved so much the decorum of the house of God! When  he appointed me to                     the office of sacristan,  he told me,   \"My  son, remember  that this is an angelic                     office.  Care for cleanness  in everything,  as we use in Messina.' Woe,  if he                     found the lamp of the  tabernacle extinguished! And how many times he warned                     me    on  this    subject!\"  \"He  wrote  some  rules  on  how  to  take  care  for    the                     cleanliness.  He  himself used to teach the sacristan how to take away  the  wax                     spots.\" \"He disliked  seeing  even  a  smut,  and everything  was to be bright.  We                     ourselves were to be clean when we entered the church.  A boarder girl dusty                     with flour  received holy Communion;  she was warned about doing so again:                     else,  she would  be deprived of Communion.  \"He was keen on taking care  of                     the  chapel,  and  often admonished the sacristan about  lack  of cleanness,  linen,                     etc.  He used to say,   'We have to economize, but  never in the things of the                     church.'  In the opening of a new house, he himself prepared the chapel.\"                        4. The sacred furnishing                              To    perform  the  worship  properly  and  decorously,    the  church  requires                     articles of linen,  vestments,  and sacred  furnishing.           Let  us  begin with the   636                     flowers on  the  altar.  The  Father prescribed,  \"Endeavor  to  put  on the altar                     elegant    vases    of  natural,  fresh  flowers.  The  houses  having  a  garden  will                     cultivate the flowers for this purpose.   Before placing them on the altar, they                     must be cleaned from the insects\" (Vol. l, page 53).                          A     former      orphan    of   our    institute   who    was      also     a floriculturist,                     testifies, \"The Father was pleased with me, when I  brought  flowers on the altar.                     The church should always  have clean, natural, fresh flowers.\"                          \"The chapel is the house of the Lord,\" he said, \"therefore, everything must be                     worthy of him.\" \"He himself took care of the liturgy's performance, teaching us                     its meaning so that we","might  participate    with    full  understanding.\"  The  vestments    should    be  rich.                     Nothing escaped him, and he called our attention even for a candle  out of place.                     \"As to the church's decorum,  he was  very  accurate,  almost scrupulous. The                     corporal shouldn't be used when it  had a little spot.  The purificator should be                     used  twice  at most, by the same priest. He said, 'As it's impolite giving one's                     own  napkin  to  another  person  at  table,    so  it  is  at  the  altar...'  The  key  of  the                     tabernacle was a matter of care.  He related sadly of  another  institute where a                     boy opened the tabernacle in  the night   and  ate  all  the  consecrated  hosts.\"  To                     avoid      the  profanation  of  the  Blessed  Sacrament,  the  Father  prescribes,  \"The                     church  will never be unguarded when it is open,  and the key  of the  tabernacle                     will be kept with care even when the  church  is closed. The sacristan is bound by                     a duty of conscience about that --and the superiors as well\" (Vol. l, page 56).                          In  Chapter  9,   no.  ll,  we  talked  about  the  Father's meticulousness  about                     bread and wine for the mass.  Let us  glean again  from the various relations.  \"He                     examined the wine for the mass  frequently,  and in case of doubt he made it                     analyzed.  To avoid that someone of the children drink the wine from the cruet,                     replacing  it  with water,  the wine had to be  prepared  shortly before the mass.\"'                          For the mass he wanted the liturgical candles of bees' wax.                          \"To  have  liturgical  candles  of  bees'  wax,    he  acted    without  thought    of                     expenses.  I  often  witnessed his  warning  to  the sacristans.  He said,  'I cannot                     forgive that!' After writing  in the  rules  'to be regardless of expenses for the                     candles of  the masses,'  he prescribes,  'Avoid the candles which bend by  heat.         637                     They are indecent,  may cause risk,  and an inconvenience  during the liturgy'\"                     (Vol. l, page 4l).                          \"He  used  to  say  that  we  should  be  unconcerned  about  expenses  for    the                     following:  worship,  charity,  and  orphans.\"  Brother Raphael,  a  sacristan  at                     Saint Anthony's  church,  recalls  the Father's care for the church. \"He wanted                     everything of luxury. As soon  as we asked for something,  he provided it quickly                     so  that our church lack nothing.\"                          When he preached or celebrated in other churches, especially in  Calabria,  he                     felt humbled and sad at sight of  the  altar's sacred  furnishing,  if decorum was                     lacking.  Shortly  after,  he himself  provided  the necessities.  \"When celebrating                     in other churches, if   he saw a lack of cleanness, especially in the corporals, he                     was  grieved  and  exhorted  us  to  be  generous  with  the  poor  churches.\"  Even                     though poor himself, he sent big alms for the furnishing of","the churches lacking means.  Once, he was given two surplices on his saint's day.                     He gave them up quickly...                          \"Any    circumstance    was  a  good  occasion  for    him    to    foster  religious                     services,    triduos,  novenas,  etc.  The  sisters  in  charge  of  the  religious  linen                     followed  his  teaching,  and  were  faultless.  Lay  people  instead  took  care  of                     cleaning the floor and  the pews. Everything was in order, and the Father had no                     reason  to  admonish  them.\"  To  tell  the  truth,  the  Father  once  happened  to                     reproach...  but    the  fact  is  unknown  to  the  above  reporter.    When  the    Father                     celebrated  mass the first time at Saint Paschal's,  he was  very grieved  because                     the carpet was not on the  predella.  When  the liturgy was over,  he pointed out                     that the candlesticks were old, but he did not forgive the absence of the carpet,                     because we had it.  \"The  sacristan was at fault,\" he said,  \"at fault were  the                     others  who did not perceive the absence of the carpet,  the more at fault was me,                     who celebrated.\"  As a penance, at lunch time he ate kneeling.                          A Daughter of Divine Zeal reports,                           I  once forgot to change  the vestments of the previous day. The  Servant  of                     God realized that the color  of  the  vestments should be another one when he                     was already on the altar saying the introit.  After mass he complained about that                     and told me that he would fast by eating bread only,  to atone for it. I knelt saying                     that I should do so,  and he concluded, \"Well, both of us will do it.\"                                                                                                               638                          Another  sister  relates:  \"I was a  sacristan  for  several years.  He always                     recommended me to provide the richest vestments and  furnishing.  He used to                     say,  'The vow of poverty is for us, not for the Lord.' When I succeeded to have                     them through work and wits, he was very glad.\"                          Also in the the week days the vestments were to be decorous. He remarked,                     \"It is true that we have to dress better on Sundays; however,  because the mass is                     the same,  the vestments are to  be beautiful every day.\" The Father also looked                     at the chevrons. He liked best the ones superimposed on the fabric,  because they                     are more striking.","5. The day of the Lord                              Sunday had to be the day of the Lord, for everyone.                          On  Saturday,  at refectory,  after reading the calendar and announcing  the                     practices of piety for the  following  day,  the reader added,  \"Sanctification of                     the  feast  through  more    prayer,  and    spiritual    reading.\"  In  the  female                     communities,  the  mother superiors  reminded  the people that the sacred feast                     should  be observed  as  the  day of the Lord and that some  of  the  weekly                     activities were not allowed on that day.                          The  Father was so rigorous about holiday rest that he  made people change                     their  personal  clothes  between  Friday  and  Saturday.  By  doing  so,    the  linen                     personnel had enough time to pick up  and book  the clothes in the week days.                     Cooking excepted,  no  other work  was allowed on Sunday.  Sunday was the day                     of the Lord.  We couldn't even clean the chapel.  But he wanted more frequent                     and longer  prayers on that day.  \"Sundays and holydays had to  stand out  both                     for dressing and personal freedom in order to have  the ease of paying private                     visits to the chapel.\"                          Beginning  with clothes,  we had to respect the  feast.  \"He demanded of us to                     dress in new clothes,  to adorn the chapel, and to rest perfectly on Sunday.\" A                     Religious specifies, \"He wanted a kind  of uniform on holydays,  which made the           639                     difference  between the week days and the great solemnities.  One day he noticed                     that Father  Palma's  brother was going to the church without  wearing the  tie.                     Approaching  him,  he remarked  that  so  dressed,  he wouldn't  go to the mayor,                     and added,  'Our Lord is greater than the  mayor...'  \"He loved the great displays                     of  ornament    in    the  solemnities,  and  some  sacristans  were  reprimanded  for                     having left out the ornament.\"                          The feast was for the body and the soul,  and we had to take care  of  both.                     \"Sunday  belonged  to  the  Lord    totally,    and    the  solemnities    had  to  be  also                     striking  in the refectory.\"  Sisters and  orphans  had  to sing,  the recreations and                     the  walk  were longer, and the food richer. He himself checked it.\"                          But  there  was  something  that he promoted  for  the  main feasts,  or special                     occasions, taking into consideration the good of souls:  the  performance.  He                     fostered  the  performance  in    our  communities    on  holydays,    and  invited  the                     people to prevent them from running the risk of sin in other places.","He writes,  \"Performance must be very moral.\" The script was to  be  approved                     by the  superiors,  who  should  eliminate  any unbecoming  expression to keep                     the serenity of children.  He  was very strict on this subject, and wrote:                           For   instance,   sometimes   the   devil   is   called   in interjections;  that  is                     improper,  because we must always detest his name;  or the most holy name of                     God is called out of purpose, in  vain;  it must be corrected.  Also the passages in                     which  the characters  tell lies must be corrected in such a way  that  they raise no                     sense of disapproval from our children,  but seem like a joke.  Likewise,  curses                     which prepare to no repentance,  nor to triumph of virtue, must be eliminated                     (Vol. l, page l59).                           In  his  spare time,  the Father wrote little works for  the performance of the                     orphaned girls.                          He was keen on declamation, and when available he supervised its rehearsal.                     Sometimes he also played the prompter.                       6. THANKSGIVING                            Potential  part  of justice is also the virtue of  gratitude that somehow rewards                     the benefactor.  What, and how many benefits has  God  given us?  Hence,  he              640                     expects  our  gratitude.  \"Render constant thanks;  such is God's will for you in                     Christ Jesus\" (l. Thes. 5, l8).                          The Father prescribes peremptorily:                           Please do not neglect this highest duty, not only because it is a great means to                     win more graces and mercies, but all the more because  the  great  donor of all                     goods  deserves  the  greatest, universal  tribute  of gratitude from  each  creature.                     Gratitude  shall  be  a  predominant  virtue  of  this  least  institute,  which  is                     consecrated to the sweetest Heart of Jesus!  Following the exhortation of Saint                     Paul:  \"In all your prayers ask God for what you need, always asking him with a                     thankful heart\" (Phil. 4, 6), we will never cease giving thanks to the Lord (Vol. l,                     page 70).","Continuing, the Father urges us to  see a great benefit from the Lord in                     everything:                           For  instance,    if  you  get  a  pin  you  need,  please  say  in  your  innermost,                     \"Thanks, God; how great your goodness is!\" or the like. No  gift  is a little one                     when it comes from God,  or   from  the divine Heart of Jesus that shelters the                     infinite, eternal love of God  for  human beings.  If we have faith,  we will not                     think  of finding a pin by chance,  by coincidence; on the contrary we will see                     Jesus as handing it to us! If we do that,  no thing will  be underestimated.  If we                     had the spirit of the saints,  we would be enraptured by the consideration of God's                     goodness who prompts the object we need.  Let us acquire at least the spirit of                     meditation through  our  efforts and the divine grace in order that  we  may thank                     the divine goodness for anything,  without  underestimating even the small things                     (Ibid.).                           The  Father  continues  writing  wonderfully on  the  divine benefits,  either                     material  and  spiritual,  dwelling  upon  the fatherly  care and love of God,  who                     provides us with  bread.  He develops the thought of a renown French prelate,                     Msgr. De Segur.                           For instance,  let us pick up a bit of bread.  Made of flour and  water,  it  is                     cooked in the oven.  Flour  comes  from  the harvest's  seeds  of wheat.  But the         641                     harvest,  on  its  turn,  is produced  by  other seeds of previous harvests,  and so                     on  back through  sixty  centuries  since  the  creation  of  the   world. Providence                     kept fructifying the harvest,  which gave those seeds of  wheat,  which made the                     bit of bread,  which you are about  to eat.  If it is possible, let us number the                     millions  of people who worked   through   the  centuries  to  produce   these                     harvests,  considering    how    many  times  the  sun,    the  earth,    and    the    rain                     fecundated  them;  how  many wooden or iron  tools,  which  imply millions  of                     people and minds working to form them,  were  used! Flour,  which made the bit                     of  bread  that  you  swallow  and    consume  in  a  moment,    was  produced  in  the                     mill...(Vol.  45, page 5l8).(l)                              We    are    talking  not  only  of  bread.    \"The  Lord  provided    us    with                     innumerable  kinds  of  food,    linen,  clothing,  houses,  and  comforts  of  life.\"                     Touching upon the marvels of grace,  the Father reminds us of what our Lord did                     and suffered for each of us. \"Each person would say:  \"The divine Word became                     man for me, suffered 34 years for me...  is dwelling in the Holy Sacrament for                     me.   He created the  angels,  his  most holy mother,  and the saints for  me.  He                     formed the holy Church,  and its treasures of grace for me.\" Then he points out:                     \"O soul,  please see how each person is bound  in duty to always thank God,  the                     most holy august Trinity,  for the benefits he receives as though he were alone on                     earth!","Also the suffering coming from the Lord is an object of  our thanksgiving.                           We  also  add  that the events or things  or  opposition  or suffering  that are                     unpleasant to the senses or to the spirit are worth   our  thanksgiving,   because                     everything,   even   God's punishment,  depends  on him and is for our good.                     Owing to these considerations, we must thank God.                          Happy  the  person  who  goes deeply  into  the  science  of gratitude  we  owe                     to  God  for  everything,   great  or  small, prosperous or unpleasant, always                     thanking  God  for  all  things  not  only  when  they  happen  but  also  when  she                     remembers them  (Vol.  l, page 7l-73).                           First, the Father asks the Lord for the virtue of gratitude. \"O  Lord,  we pray to                     you that among the virtues coming from your Holy  Spirit you also grant us a                     pure,  holy gratitude  for  your graces.  We  want  to express it through  frequent                     thanksgiving\" (S.C.  Vol. 9, page 66, no. l3). Thanksgiving will always precede                     our  petition for new help and divine mercies.  \"While making the supplication,                     we  have  to  premise  before  each  petition  an affectionate thanksgiving for the                     graces already granted \" (Vol.                     l, page 8l).                          Both  in  the  fulfillment of the office  and  in  the  last prayers  of the evening,                     we must thank the Lord.                                                                   642                           \"Besides  being  prayerful,  each will be   mindful  to  give thanks  to the                     divine mercy for the good fulfillment of the task, and  before  going  to  sleep                     everyone will  thank  God  for  the enlightenment  and the graces he granted                     them during the  day  to help  them fulfill their tasks,  begging pardon for their                     faults\" (Vol. l, page l24).                           At  the end of the day,  the Father offered to the Lord  the Lord's  merits along                     with  the  merits  of  the  Immaculate    Heart    of  Mary;    as    well  as  the  masses                     celebrated on the same  night,  the masses celebrated before,  and the ones which                     would  be  celebrated  in  the  future.    He  also  offered  the  Eucharistic  Supper                     celebrated  with  the  apostles,    as  well  as  the  sacrifice  on  Calvary.  He  said,  \"I                     make  this  offering  in thanksgiving for  the  mass  I  have celebrated and for the                     Communion  I  have  received  in  the    morning;  as  well  as  for  so  many  aids,                     assistance,  providence,  preservation  from  evil,    and  good  meetings  you  have                     granted to me. I also want to  atone  for my miseries and sins,  willing to thank                     for  your infinite patience in tolerating and helping me.\"","When  the respect for God was at stake,  the Father paid  no attention  to                     human respect.  For instance,  when the orphans who were  fugitives from the                     earthquake entered Francavilla  Fontana, the lay committee had established to go                     directly from the station to the city hall for the reception.  The Father opposed the                     plan. He  \"required that the orphans go first to the Capuchin's  church  to thank                     God  and  implore  the  celestial  protection.\"  They  did    so.  After  the  religious                     service, which ended with the blessing of the Sacrament,  the people went to the                     city hall (S.C.  Vol.  l, page l27).                          For  the  evening  meditation on  the  divine  benefits,  he prescribed  the                     book  by  Sarnelli.    \"To  foster  gratitude  and  to  frequently  thank  the  Lord,  the                     booklet by Sarnelli on the Divine Benefits is of great help\" (Vol. l, page 70). \"On                     the last day of the year, he made us say after any prayer, 'thanks be to God'.\"                          Once he prescribed: \"Up to a new order, after each decade of the  holy  rosary                     we'll say all together,  'thanks be  to  God'!\" (Vol.  34, page l55). We did so for                     several months. Father Vitale perhaps made a remark,  because the Father wrote                     to him,  \"Thanks be  to God.  I too considered the matter of the indulgences.  But                     the    words    of  the  preface,    'It  is  our  duty  and    our    salvation,  always    and                     everywhere to give you thanks,' made me  prefer  the fulfillment of this sacred                     duty to the indulgences of the rosary. However,  we will take advice from the                     superiors\"  (Vol.    33,  page  30).  We  deem  that  the  advice  was  contrary  to  his                     opinion, because the practice of saying 'thanks be to God' ended.                          He  wanted  each  house to write the divine  benefits  in  a special  book.  \"The    643                     mother superior will pay careful  attention that  the historiographer record the                     special  graces,    the    divine  mercies,    and    the  spiritual  or  temporal  benefits                     concerning  the house.\"  These  benefits  will be remembered  in  the  triduo  of                     thanksgiving at the end of the year. Then, he exhorts to preserve the records.                           The records must  be preserved jealously in the archives  to be  at the disposal                     of our institute's future generations;  thus, the present and the future houses will                     nurture great,  continuous gratitude  to  the  divine infinite goodness  not  only                     for  the general  but  also for the special graces which were  granted  to each                     house.  Likewise,  following her devotion,  each sister will record  or keep in                     mind the memories of the special  graces,  for which  she feels obliged toward                     the divine amorous  lover,  Jesus (Vol. l, page ll8).","7. The Blessed Sacrament in the new chapel                              The  presence of the Blessed Sacrament in the institute  was considered by the                     Father  as  one  of  the  greatest  graces.  He  wanted  the  institute  to  have  an                     everlasting gratitude for it through the institution  of the feast on July first and                     additional  practices to  which  we have pointed out before.  Now we remember                     the    last  public    honor  he  gave  to  the  Blessed  Sacrament.    We  quote    Father                     Vitale:                           Because  the  chapel  of  the  Holy  Spirit    was  too  small  for  the  increasing                     population of the community,  the sisters prepared  a roomier,  nicer one. When                     the altar and the tabernacle were ready to  receive  Jesus in the Holy  Sacrament,                     the    mother    superior  thought  of  doing  something  pleasant  for  the  padre  by                     inviting one  of  our priests to transfer the  Holy Sacrament to the new chapel,                     according to liturgical rite.                          But  the padre's reaction to their good idea turned  out  to surprise the sisters.                     He burned as of sacred fury, and with heavy emphasis  he said:  \"How dare you                     remove  the  Holy  Sacrament    from  his    dwelling    without    having    a    solemn                     thanksgiving  for  the innumerable  graces  that  he has granted the community                     and    our  institution  in  the  many  years  he  has  resided  in  that  place?    What   644                     coldness!    What  ingratitude!\"  Then  thinking  he  would  be  in    time,  he    went                     upstairs  to stop the transfer which  the  sisters  had already  done.  He  turned                     pale as if he had been stricken by  an inner wound,  his eyes filled with tears, and                     he ordered the Holy Sacrament  put  back in his former place.  Then he  gathered                     the  community  together,    made  them  understand  the  indispensable    duty  of                     thanking our Lord for the graces granted from the tabernacle, and commanded a                     solemn  triduo  of  adoration,    in  which  sisters  and  orphans    participated  in  the                     thanksgiving one after  another.  In the  evening,  the padre,  Father Palma,  and                     Father Vitale  gave appropriate speeches for each of the three days.                          The padre preached on January l2; even though suffering from his illness,  he                     seemed to become younger in the Holy Sacrament's presence.  How  eloquent he                     was that evening,  the last  time  he preached  in  the church!  To begin with, he                     made his audience consider that the first","dwelling place of Jesus in the house was that tabernacle that happened to be the                     bright center of all  the graces for thirty-one years. He said:                          \"At  the  end of the  year,  we used to read the list of  the divine gifts we                     received.  Who can have the list of thirty  years and  count this great treasure,                     this river of continuous mercies that  has sprung out of this source,  i.  e.  Jesus in                     the    Holy  Sacrament?    Here,    Jesus  has  been  as  a  loving  Father,  a  helper,  a                     comforter, a life-giver; here, we started Eucharistic Day on July first;  here,  we                     have presented petitions, vigils, prayers; here Jesus,  in  the  silence  of the  Holy                     Sacrament,    received    and  prepared  the  proof  of  his  love  through  the  holy                     communion.                          People say that when Jesus came back from Egypt,  he  wanted to  enter the                     Bethlehem stable.   I would also say that we should leave  here  in tears owing to                     our  dear  remembrances.  Eighteen years ago, some of you were safe because                     you were here during  the earthquake.  Besides,  is it not from here that Jesus                     looked  at, called,  and told each of you He wanted to save you? Here, we had the                     taking of the habit;  here,  many souls,  that are in heaven now, were formed  in                     front of this tabernacle!                          In  addition,    let  us  remember  the  particular  signs  that    the  Virgin  Mary's                     motherly love gave from this place.\"                          In the evening of the l5th,  the five priests of the orders, the sisters,  and the                     orphans transferred the Holy Sacrament in a procession  to the new oratory.  The                     act was accompanied by hymns and songs.  Before the blessing, the padre urged             645                     the community to new  fervor and love toward our Lord in the Holy  Sacrament                     once again (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, pages 358-59).                           We    end  the  topic  about  gratitude  toward  God  by    remembering  that    the                     Father  offered 33 masses to the  Lord  in  l924,  \"in thanksgiving  for  all  the                     graces,  the  great,  extraordinary, manifest,  and  hidden mercies;  as well as for                     the  preservation from evil,  for the gifts,  the vocations, charity, and blessings                     that  you have granted to these institutes and to me,  a  sinner\" (Vol. 6, page l02).                       8. He was upright with his neighbor                             Now  we  treat  the virtue of justice as  regulator  of  our relations with our                     neighbor.                          We    report  some  generic  evidences  about  the  Father's  justice  with  his                     neighbor.                           \"As to justice, he was scrupulously exact.\"  \"He always","respected  the rights of others.  His creditors were always  paid off,  and  he had a                     special bookkeeping for each of them.\" \"As to justice,  I know that he was always                     upright with God and men.  \"I always  saw him perfect in his priestly duties.\"                     \"As  much    as    I  know,    he  was  always  upright  with  God  and  men.\"  \"To  my                     knowledge, he  always respected the rights of God,  and he did the same with his                     neighbor.\" \"I exclude that he ever failed in his duties about justice.\" \"Not only he                     met  the  rights  of  the  orphans  and    others,  but    also    helped    generously  the                     unemployed.\" \"He paid  off  the rights  of  men;  he  also praised the workers                     and  us  for  the fulfilling of our duty.\" \"He didn't take away a hair from anyone.                     People  told me that a worker at the Holy Spirit's mill was given a quarter of loaf.                     When the Father knew it, he ordered to give a whole loaf.\"                          I  have to clear a statement of a witness,  who  thought  of human  prudence,                     but  others  could interpret it as  a  fact  of injustice.                          Let us read the relation: \"The Father lacked human prudence. When  he  was                     about to build the church and  the  orphanage,  he occupied  little areas of others'                     land which were  necessary  for the  project,  delaying  the  regulation of the                     affair  with  the owners.  However,  his  unwariness  never happened to be  to  his                     prejudice,  it also turned to be pleasant to the owners.  -- With Padre Francia,                     nothing to do...\"                          Let us specify the fact.                          The    Father  commissioned  the  project  as  though  all  the    land  were    his                     property,  because he presumed that the owners  had  no difficulty to sell it to          646                     him.  In fact,  the witness says,  \"With Padre Francia,  nothing to do.\"  However,                     one of the owners, Mr. Puleo,  holder of the mill and bakery of Gazzi,  tried to                     put the Father in trouble because of political ideas. He could not suffer that  his                     land be used for the building of  a  church...  Father Vitale tried to approach him                     more than once,  but he pretended to be deaf. When the Father was informed, he                     wrote to Father Vitale, \"Let us begin saying special prayers,  because the devil                     will try  to  play a  dirty  trick on us  through  this owner\" (Vol.  33,  page  20).                     Once, the Father sent Mr. Rosary Marchese to invite the man to  give in,  but he                     rebuked Mr.  Marchese with rage, \"I would rather give the land to the devil, not                     to  Padre  Francia!\"  As  soon  as  the  Father  was  told  of  this  revilement,  he  said                     calmly, \"This time I will become a devil, so I will have the land for the church.\"                     He had the donkey hitched up to the calash, hastened to Gazzi, talked","with Mr.  Puleo for a few minutes, and returned to Messina.  Then he sent Mr.                     Marchese to Father Vitale telling him to keep in touch with Mr. Puleo and draw                     up the contract.                        9. His debts                              Treating  about justice,  Tanquerey writes,  \"We must have a horror  of debts,                     when we are not sure of paying  them  off.  If someone has contracted any, he                     will make a point of honor in paying them off, as soon as possible\" (Comp. di                     teologia ascetica e mistica, no. l042, b).                          If the saints would have followed this rule, they would have been  unable to                     do  what  they  did...    This  does  not  mean  that  they  escape  the  rules  of  morals,                     rather they apply them in the  light of  God.  Reading  the life of Don  Bosco,                     Cottolengo,  and   Don Orione,   we   see that their debts are written in capital                     letters. These saints were up to their ears in debts,  but were  justified in their                     way of acting by their firm trust in God. They were sure of  paying them off,  and                     Providence backed their pledges.  As  a matter of fact, none of their creditors was                     disappointed.                                                                             647                          After  bartering  the things of his house,  the  Father  was compelled  to  run                     into debts in order to make  the  institution continue.  Debts  became  an  issue of                     his conscience to  such  a degree  that  the  Servant of God Don Cusmano  had  to                     calm  the Father's  spirit.  Writes  the Father,  \"One day I  asked  Father Cusmano                     whether  the  charitable  institution  could  run  into  debts.  He    answered  in  the                     affirmative,  because we urge the people  who give us credit to perform a work of                     charity\" (S.C.  Vol.  9, page l47).                          Let us see the various relations on the Father's debts.                          \"He  always  paid  off his debts,  and when he was  late  by necessity,  the                     interests  grew  up  with  usury.  He  used  to  say  that  his    creditors    did  not  get                     worried.\" \"Especially  in  the  early times,  he bought on credit;  but sooner or                     later, he always paid off.  He  did not trade on the price,  sometimes instead he                     gave  more.\"  \"He  always  paid  his  debts.    When  something  was  unpaid,  it                     happened because it was remitted, as in the case of the baker Notturno.\"  The                     Father sometimes asked for a reduction from his","creditors,  as  we read in the letter of March l889.  \"I remit 60 liras  on account of                     the two bills amounting to  83.53  liras.  I would  like having some discount on                     the remnant,  because it is a matter of orphans.  If it is not possible,  I will remit                     what you say\" (Vol.  4l,  page l0). He ran into debts even with his sister Teresa.                     Her daughter says, \"Now and then, he asked my mother  for money,  which he                     paid back little by little,  until she  remitted the remnant.\"                          Knight    Crupi,      a    printer,    proposed    the    purchase    of    a  typographic                     machine to the Father,  who was unable to buy it  in that  circumstance.  Still,  the                     printer delivered the  machine. Later,  the Servant of God  paid it off up to the                     last  cent.  More  than  once  the  Father  complained  when  people  asked  more  for                     their  service,    because,    he    said,    'he  used  to  overpay  them'.\"  An  old  former                     worker testifies,  \"In my time,  we were always in  debts with grocers;  but the                     alms-boxes and our begging (me and  Father D'Agostino) always paid off our                     debts.\"                          \"When  the  Father was unable to pay his debts  quickly,  he overpaid  them                     later.\" \"He paid off his debts,  and when  he  was unable to do so on time,  he                     couldn't  rest.  He  called  upon  me  and  the  orphans  to  pray  Saint  Joseph  in  the                     church.  The saint always heard  our  prayer  quickly,  even in  circumstances                     which  seem prodigious to me.\" Once,  a l0,000 lira bill was over due.  After                     praying    to    Saint  Joseph,    the  Father  asked  and  obtained  a    loan  from    the                     Brothers Sacca',  forwarding agents.  Gone to  pay  the bill,  the creditor said that                     it  had  been  paid  off  by  an  old  man.  The  Father  trotted  gladly  to  the  Brothers   648                     Sacca' to give back the loan.   But  when they knew that the Servant of God had                     prayed to Saint Joseph before asking the loan, they were amazed at the fact and                     refused to receive the money,  because it belonged to a saint --they said.\"                          Please  read  an original interpretation of a  sister.  \"The Father always paid                     off his debts; when he was unable to, the Lord did  it.  I explain my statement.                     Anxious about how to pay  the l4,000  lira  bill  for  the  mill  and  the  bakery,                     we  prayed continuously  to the Lord for help.  But the December   28,  l908                     earthquake  came  in,  and the creditors along with  their  heirs died.  We were                     free from the debt.  However,  we said many masses and other prayers for the                     dead.\"                          A sister reports:","One day the Father told me very gladly, \"The Lord made me very happy.                     You must know that before the earthquake I went  to Mr.  Rotino, in Messina, to                     ask a loan of 2,000 liras. Mr. Rotino was out,  but his son gave me the money                     immediately.  With  joy  and  humiliation  I  promised  to  give  it  back  as  soon  as                     possible,  but the  earthquake  came  in and none of that family  was  seen  any                     longer.  A  few days ago,  while going to the Dominican Sisters I happened to                     run into a pale,  meager,  shabby young man at Salita del  Grillo.  'Do  you know                     me,  Father?' He  said.   I  did  not recognize  him immediately.  He said his                     name.    I  was  struck  with  wonder.    I  told  him  that    I  had  a  thorn  in  my  side                     because I  was in a condition to pay off the old debt,  but I was unable to find the                     creditor.  I  gave him the 2,000 liras,  provided  him  with clothes,  and assigned a                     monthly  help  to him until he recovers himself financially.\"                         10. His deep sense of justice                              Brother Louis, who was a prefect to the orphans for a few decades, reports,                                                                                                               649                          The  Servant  of God didn't have any preference.  Should  an orphan  be  right,                     he  would be judged right  even  against  the opinion of Father Vitale. One day I                     deemed to dismiss an eighteen years  old orphan in order to avoid the evil he  had                     threatened. Both  the Servant of God and Father Vitale were out.  When Father                     Vitale came back,  he was informed.  Amazed, he said that I could have waited                     for him, even because the orphan was recommended by a person of high rank of                     Messina,  who for sure had been  offended. The Servant of God,  however, after                     taking into consideration the things, said that I had behaved well.                           The  Father  wrote  to the Morning Star  Sisters  and  asked prayers  for  the                     suit of Avignone.  \"I beg you to  pray  for  a lawsuit,  if we are right\" (Vol.  39,                     page 67). When Msgr. Farina was  appointed  apostolic visitor to the Daughters                     of the  Sacred Side,  the Father recommended to the mother superior \"to want and                     desire the triumph of the truth only. If we are wrong, we want to be declared                     wrong;    if  we  are  right,    right,  for  the  glory  of  God  and    the  good  of  souls.                     Therefore,  we must help ourselves  with prayer\" (S.C. Vol. 8, page 222).                           Let us proceed to other things on the subject of justice. We","know that the Father \"overpaid people because of his deep  sense of justice.\"                          We  have  already  said that the Father took  the  necessary steps to buy Saint                     Paschal's former convent through the mediation of  the  bishop.  Now  we give                     further details  of  the  business by quoting Bishop Di Tommaso.                           The  price   of Saint Paschal's former  convent  was  25,000 liras,  and  I                     pledged myself to reduce it on behalf of Canon  Di Francia,  who wanted to buy                     it for his orphans. Yet, when he knew that  the  owner  did not make a donation,                     but was  selling  the building  because  he  was  encumbered  with  debts,  instead                     of expressing  his satisfaction to me who had succeeded in  reducing the price, he                     almost felt mortified.                           Father   Vitale specifies:                           Msgr.  Di Tommaso was gladly amazed at the Father's childish naivety  and                     exquisite  sense  of justice  with  regard  to  the purchase  of Saint Paschal's land,                     I think.  For fear  that  the price  was  unfair because of an error of the owner,  the                     Father proposed  to give a sum greater that the fixed one  by  contract. But the                     owner too admired his finesse of conscience,  and refused to  accept  any  extra                     money.  At the  end,  the  bishop  had  to intervene to calm down the Father's                     conscience.                                                                                                               650                          The  Father bought other monastic buildings,  such as  Saint Benedict  in Oria,                     the Holy Spirit in Messina,  the Capuchins in Taormina.   In  each  case,   not                     only   he  did  so  with   the ecclesiastical  and the civil approval,  but also offered                     masses and prayers for the people who had dwelt in those buildings. When the                     Morning    Star  Sisters  were  taking  the  steps  to  buy  a    former  convent  of  the                     Carmelites, the Father wrote:                           You ask first the most holy Heart of Jesus whether he  wants to  give  it  to                     you  with  his  full  blessing    and    enjoyment.    The  monastic    goods    that  were                     bought by lay people,  even  with  the approval  of  the  ecclesiastical  authority,                     sometimes  involve expiation. Please begin saying special prayers for the holy                     souls of the Carmelites,  especially for the sisters who dwelt in  that building.                     May  they  intercede  for you,  and you may  have  the building with the full                     divine blessing.                           Then,  he  makes  a  remark about the purchase  he  made  in Messina:","By permission of Rome, we have been given the beautiful convent of the                     Cistercian  Sisters,  which  was  empty.  And  yet,  for  about  a  decade,    sisters,                     probationers,  and orphaned girls died continuously!   Finally,  the earthquake                     killed  thirteen    sisters  and  destroyed  two  thirds  of  the  building.    After  the                     earthquake, things  began  proceeding normally.  Every month we pray for  the                     souls of the sisters departed (Vol. 39, page l2).                           We  often read in the Father's notes the masses he said  for the Religious who                     dwelt in the houses handed down to us:  sisters of the Holy Spirit,  Capuchins of                     Taormina, Alcantarines of Saint Paschal,  and nuns of Saint Benedict.  He also                     applied masses for the  \"living Benedectines and Alcantarines,  and prayed that                     the communities  living in those houses have grace and health\"  (S.C. pages 67-                     77-78...).                          We    also    point  out  that  by  his  sense  of  justice  the    Father  bewared  of                     attracting to him the persons who were working in  the apostolate.  We read in                     his  notes:  \"While  traveling  by  trolley  in  Rome  in  the  evening  of  October  26,                     l925, I met Ms. Belloni  Emily who is living in Nomentana Street, l9l, Rome. She                     is a very pious zealous member of Saint Vincent de Paul Society.  Can we hire                     her as  a distributor of the Anthonian booklets?  To keep her in  the holy  mission                     for the poor of Saint Vincent de Paul,  I would say no\"  (S.C.  Vol.  l0,  page  82).                     During the  l9l5-l8  war,  the typography of Oria was deprived of its workers by          651                     the calling  up to the army.  The Father writes to Father Vitale:  \"Let us praise                     and  trust the divine will!\" A worker from Sicily offered himself for that job, but                     the Father remarks \"If this man is working in a Catholic  typography  very long,                     can we take him away?  I  don't think  so\" (Vol.  3l,  page 90).  He hired the man                     a few days  by emergency, then he sent him back.                          He  disliked bargaining on price.  \"One day  Brother  Joseph Anthony Meli                     was  boasting  before  the  Father  because  he  had  bought  the  fruit  very  cheaply,                     almost nothing,  after bargaining... the Servant of God plainly observed that he                     did like doing so because the  seller has his own rights;  therefore,  he preferred                     Brother Placid who used to say, 'The sellers are not demanding'.\"                          On this subject, the Father had his own criteria. One day he asked a coachman                     how much he charged to take him to the  station. \"Two liras,  my Father,\" he                     said. \"Two liras? It's very cheap. At least three.\"                          Writes Father Vitale:                           \"Among the innumerable acts of charity,  I like referring to the following one.                     One rainy evening in December of l9l5, while","coming back from Oria I stopped at Reggio Calabria because there was  no  ferry                     service.  A porter helped me find  a  safe  hotel because there were no vacancies                     around.                          When the padre was told about it, he asked me: 'How much did you give the                     porter?'                          When  I  answered  that  I  had  given  the  man  two  liras  (which  in  those  days                     made the man very happy),  he said:  'Too little,  too little. Do  you know his                     name?'                          'Vito Morabito,' I said.                          Writing his name in his notebook, the padre said: 'When I go to Reggio, I will                     find him to make recompense.'                          Later,  he told me gladly that fortunately he had found  the man  and  that  he                     had repaid the obligation  with  more  money\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia,                     page 347).                           But,  the  evident injustice made him  indignant.  A  sister narrates:                           After  Easter,  the Father proposed to us and the orphans  a trip to a village                     near  Messina.  All  walked,  except  me  and  four  or  five  orphans  who  went  by                     coach without stipulating the price with the coachman. Arrived at the village, I                     had an argument with him, because  he  charged too much.  The Servant  of  God                     intervened, checked  the taximeter,  and told the man that we had to pay  the fare        652                     due,  not more.  The coachman began cursing,  and the Father responded  that                     justice must be observed.  If we had to give  him any extra money, that should be                     given for extra reasons. However, the  cursing  of that  poor man made the Father                     melancholy,  his smile died out,  and he left. When he returned in the evening, he                     mildly  scolded  me for my negligence and consoled us  by  saying that he had                     gone  to  calm  and  make  the  man  acknowledge  his  faults.  To  atone  for  the                     blasphemies,  he suggested a short pilgrimage to Our Lady of the Angels' church,                     on a nearby hill of the village. To  raise the sisters' morale who were shocked by                     the sad  event, the Father told us a few jokes during our walk.                           Above  all,  the  Father insisted on  meeting  the  workers' rights.  \"He  never                     disappointed the workers,  nor us who had  a monthly  pay.\"   A  sister reports:                     \"In  the  early  times,  our financial situation was bad,  and few of us reduced the                     workers' wage  on the sly.  As soon as the Father knew it,  he was amazed, and                     scolded,  and  threatened us,  cautioning against  doing  so again.\"                          He  wrote,  \"The  sisters  will  observe  justice  by  paying  the  workers'  legal                     wages; they will practice charity by avoiding","overworking  the  laborers;    will  be  benign  with  them  by  abounding    in                     consideration and retribution\" (Vol. l, page 22l).                          It  goes without saying that some employees did not  produce as  they  should.                     More  than  once  I  heard  the  Father    complaining  about  those  who  abused  his                     kindness.  He said, \"Oh, human misery! They  do  not appreciate the fatherly                     government!...\"  He  meant, \"What can we do? I, however, will not change my                     system.\"                          In  fact,  he was always very compassionate and  helpful  to everyone.                             A former employee narrates:                           One day I had to absent myself from the work because my wife was  sick.                     The Servant of God happened to know it and during the day asked several times                     about me.  Informed,  the following day I approached  him  and  let him know                     that I was a  father  for  the seventh time.  He gave me 500 liras as a present,                     more 200 liras for the baptism; furthermore, he placed the institute's calash at my                     disposal. He told me that he would be present in spirit and in prayer  that day                     December  8,    which  was  auspicious.    After   forty  days,    a    typhous  infection                     jeopardized  not  only  my  wife's    life,  but  also  my  son  for  lack  of  milk.    The                     Servant of God  encouraged me by saying that he would pray and that Our Lady                     had  assured  him  that    my    wife    would  be  healed.    As  to  my  son,    he    was                     worried because the milk of several animals had hurt him.  He gave me the milk                     of his cows for about one year.  My son healed and grew  up stronger  than  the           653                     other ones...    On the occasion of  a  great feast,  my  wife urged me to provide                     my  children  with    shoes.    To  avoid  taking  advantage  of  the  Servant  of  God's                     generosity,  when he sent me for an errand which required little time,  I pawned                     my watch along with its golden chain at 'Cassa di Risparmio Vittorio Emanuele.'                     I  concealed  my  banking  transaction.  No  one  was present.  At my coming                     back the Servant of God asked me why I was so late. I told him the fact with                     reserve, and he kept insisting, \"You  must  know  that  I am not like  a  brigand                     threatening  a wayfarer in the forest with a dagger, saying, 'Your money or your                     life'! By normal mail I send money even abroad to people I do not know,  why                     shouldn't I help the  needy  ones  who are around  me?  On the other hand,  you                     realize  that  I  cannot  prevent  everything,  nor  can    I    take  care  of  everything                     because  I  am  busy  with  plenty    of  things;  therefore,  some  of  your  needs  can                     escape me.\" The content of his speech made a strong impression on me,  so I                     asked  myself \"Does  he  have  perceived my transaction?\" I let  him  know  the                     thing.  \"I  should  punish  you,\"  he  said,  \"because  you  have concealed  it.  I                     will do so if you relapse.\"  He gave me 250  or 300  liras to close my transaction                     at the bank,' and ordered  the treasurer to raise my monthly salary from 300 to                     600 liras.                           James  Cappadonna,  a  worker who lived in the community  of Oria,  after                     retiring  decided  to remain with  us  \"to  prepare","himself  to  a holy death in the house of God.\" The  Father  took careful attention                     to his needs, and wrote,                           \"I  warmly  recommend  you  to  take    loving  care  of  the  good  old  man                     Cappadonna.  He has complained that children have taken  away his  walking                     stick.  Provide him with another one fitting for his needs,  and when he goes to                     the  church  up  and  down  the  stairs,  go  along    with    him.    Since  he  has  lost                     appetite.  but  eats  sweets heartily, provide them from Sister Elisabeth\" (Vol. 30,                     page 62).                           The Father himself bought the fitting stick,  one of luxury, very comfortable.                     At his first coming to Oria,  the Father    gave the old man the stick along with                     sweets, greatly embellishing the gift with his own smile. Later, Cappadonna was                     struck by paresis. \"If  you had seen the Father busy to serve and to wash him,                     when he  was  unaware  of his own relieving! The little  room  of  the patient                     was across the Father's room,  and any time  the  Father came in or out of it,  he                     visited and comforted the sick old man. Even  though  Cappadonna dispensed                     with our service,  the  Father demanded that we attend to him in shifts in the                     night.  Once,  he scolded  us very  severely  because none had taken away the                     plates from the man after breakfast.   \"Don't you understand,\" he  said, \"that these                     poor represent better Jesus Christ? When we are sick, all  of us are ready to serve;                     shouldn't we do it better for the poor that are the more expressive images of Jesus? \"    654                        11. Give Caesar what belong to Caesar                           Let  us treat another potential part of justice:  obedience. This  virtue  inclines                     the will to execute the  commands  of  the superiors,  acknowledging the divine                     authority in them (Rom.  l3, l).  When we treat the subject of the religious vows,                     we'll  talk  about    that.    Here  we  confine  ourselves  to  treating  the    Father's                     obedience and observance toward the civil authority.","\"He   was   always obedient and respectful   toward   the ecclesiastical and civil                     authority.\" \"Taking into  consideration many  things,  he  always  acknowledged                     God's  authority  in  the ecclesiastical and civil superiors.\" \"For him,  obedience                     toward the  bishop  and on the whole toward the superiors was  a  strict duty.\"  \"I                     never realized any fault in his duties toward God.  As to  the  men endowed with                     authority,  he told us to  revere  them because they represent God.\" \"Even though                     they do evil to us,  we must  be  subject  to  the  authorities.\"  \"Visiting  the                     other communities,  he  often paid his first visits to the  archdeacon, the mayor,                     the religious and civil authorities.\"                          He  used to say:  \"The mayor may not be a good Catholic or a true Christian,                     but is always an authority to be obeyed.\"                          He  wrote to give due regards to all authorities:                           When    the    sisters    keep    in    touch    with    civil    or      state  authorities    in                     occasion of their visits to the institute or  in any other event,  they will pay the                     greatest respect by using the reverent speech which is due to their dignity.                          Both in  the cities and in the little towns, the sisters  will foster  among the                     pupils and the orphans the esteem for the king, the queen,(2) the prefect,  and the                     mayor. When it is required by society,  they will send greeting cards to them and                     their  ladies on special occasions,  such as their saint's day,  birthday,  and main                     feasts  like New Year's Day and  Christmas.  It  is  always useful.  In  some                     occurrence  they  may  send  a  gift  such  as devotions,  children's small works,        655                     etc. It is excellent inviting them to attend performances or rewards after exams,                     etc.  When a personality happens to fall ill, the community will  be concerned,                     will  get  information,  will let him know that the community  is praying; during                     the convalescence a cake or something else may be also sent.                          All this induces esteem and affection;  we, however, have to do  so not for                     human protection but by faith,  confiding  in  God only.  And  yet,  we  have  to                     use licit means to  keep  friendly relations with authorities because of the good                     results for  God's glory,   for  the  institute's  good,  and  for  the  persons  in                     authority,  who  are  led   to  form a good opinion  of  the  holy religion along                     with its institutions (vol. l, page 22l).                           Leaving the moralists debating about the moral obligation of observing penal                     laws,    in  practice  the  Father  required  the    exact  observance  of  the  authorities'                     dispositions.                          \"He observed exactly the laws. One day I brought some cheese I was given by                     my family.  The Father asked me whether I had paid the duty,  and  I told him                     that I had concealed it. 'I am tempted to send you back, he said, to pay the duty;                     you have to confess it'.\"   A few months after the earthquake, a typographic","machine  was    sent  to  Oria  dismounted  into  several  boxes.    Brother    Joseph                     Anthony    mailed    a  letter  specifying  the  boxes  along    with    their  numbers  as                     though they were containing salt,  which is a monopoly in  Apulia.  As  soon as                     the  Servant  of  God  knew  it,    he    sent    a  telegram    and  shortly  after  a  letter                     reprimanding the fact.\"  \"He was  also  scrupulous about the rights of  Caesar.                     One  day, after pointing out to the meat and the fodder in the  calash,  he made                     me  hold  three  eggs and a bottle  of  altar  wine  before customs.  The agent                     smiled and left us through.  The Father said, 'We  have to do so!'  He was also                     scrupulous in paying taxes  and recommended  us   to attentively observe the                     civil  ordinances.\" \"Questioned at the station by the customs officers whether he                     was  carrying  food,    the  Father  showed  some  home-made  biscuits  to  calm  the                     pangs of hunger during the journey,  and he paid nothing. But remembering  that                     he  had  also  two  doughnuts  in    the    pocket,    he  returned  to  report  them.                     Obviously, the officers smiled at that.\"                          Read  how  a sister avoided customs.  \"To avoid  paying  300 liras  to customs                     for fifty scarfs for the orphans,  the officers suggested  to me to cover the scarfs                     with two old  ones.  When  I informed the Father, he reprimanded me saying that                     it was against justice and truth,  and that I should return to remedy.  I worked                     hardly to calm him down!\"                          \"One  day  I told him that I  used again  a few stamps  that were in good                     conditions.  'No,  no,' he said,   'even though  the saving goes to the missions,                     that's not right.  Give Caesar what belongs to Caesar; give God, what belongs to          656                     God'.\"                          Brother  Joseph Anthony was unable to buy the ticket for the tram in Rome                     because of the crowd. He arrived at the destination, and  got out.  The Father                     ordered him to catch up the man of  the tram and to hand him the forty cents due.                     But the brother did not succeed.                          In l9l9 Mr.  Giglio was going to Naples and the Father asked us to send sugar                     and spaghetti with him.  He added, \"On condition that  there is no difficulty in                     the  journey,    and  it  is    possible  without  any  trick  against  customs.  If  the  law                     prohibits it, leave it  out;  if you can pay the duty,  do so\" (Vol.  35,  page 22l).                     Then,  he remembers that his uncle Chitti is blind,  and his only hobby  is  pipe                     smoking,  but there is a scarcity of  tobacco  in Naples.\"  Therefore,  he asks to                     find some in Messina.  \"Send  it with Giglio, if he can do it without prejudice\"                     (Ibid. page 222).","One  day,  in  Messina  we  had  to  overpay  the  electricity  bill  because    the                     typographic  rotary machine did not  work  for  two months,  and we had not                     reached the minimum of contract. To avoid the incovenience,  the officer himself                     suggested in confidence to idle  the  machine,  as everyone does in such a  case.                     When  the Father  knew  it,  he exclaimed,  \"But this is a fraud!  And  the officer                     was  scandalized  because you kept silent.  You  had  to protest!\"  Furthermore,                     he  let  the  officer  know  that   his suggestion   was   unacceptable  \"because  the                     Religious   don't defraud!\"                          I heard from Lawyer John Parisi who was an employee at the post office for                     many years that he had suggested the sisters to avoid declaring the total number                     of the 300.000 copies of God and Neighbor.  As  the  Father knew it,  he refused                     the  suggestion, because it would make us commit two evils: lie and theft.                       12. Love of his own country                              \"Give Caesar what belongs to Caesar\" includes love for one's own  country.  It                     is true that such a love \"can  degenerate  and become excessive and dangerous                     nationalism,\" Pius XII remarked to the  \"Marchigiani\"  in a speech known far and                     wide;  but we  must avoid  going  to  opposite  excess.   The  Pope  complains            657                     that \"sometimes  we  meet people who are afraid of being  particularly fond of                     their  homeland...    Some  even  avoid  to  pronounce  the    word  homeland,    and                     replace it with another one  more fitting for them. But  the decreased love for                     one's  own  country  is  one  of  the  signs  of  the  spiritual  confusion\"  (March  23,                     l958). The Second Vatican Council confirms these concepts:                           \"Citizens    should    cultivate  a  generous  and  loyal  spirit    of  patriotism,    but                     without narrow-mindedness,  so that  they  will always  keep in mind the welfare                     of the whole human family  which is  formed  into  one by various kinds of  links                     between  races, peoples,  and  nations\"  (G.S.  no.  75).  It follows that  \"true                     patriotism  is a Christian virtue\" (Royo  Marin,  Teologia  della perfezione, page                     674).                           Also this virtue must be pointed out in the Father.","First, for homeland we mean the native city.                          The  Father loved so much his Messina.  He used to say,  \"My Messina,  my                     beloved Messina.\" He sang the glories which made her famous.  \"Classic land of                     heroes...  rose of the pretty Peloro... famous in the war-cry... When at the sound                     of the martial  poems, Angioino  abandoned Sicily...\" But he exalted Christian                     faith the most.  \"The  true glory of a people,\" he said,  \"consists in  his faith,                     because  faith  consists in the intellect's  respect  for eternal truths. Thus, a human                     being becomes a servant of God, and serving God is like reigning\" (Vol. 22, page                     25).                               In science and art of reigning                               You were second to none.                               Noble mother of noble geniuses,                               Your fame undying will be.                               No, Italy has not a land                               More fecund and pretty than this.                                But  more beautiful, great, and divine                               Than in any profane glory,                               You stand out among all, O Messina,                               For the faith enflaming your heart.                               The sacred treasure of the letter                               Surrounds you with sovereign glory.                                             658                                                                  (Vol. 47, page 2l4).                           From  the native city we proceed to the nation.  The  Father loved Italy.  He                     wanted  it  \"great,    magnanimous,    and    powerful,\"  exalting    it  as  the  one                     \"privileged among the nations\" (Vol.  47, page  l09).  Unfortunately,  those  were                     days  when  the  \"Roman controversy\" was alive and burning,  and he was deeply                     grieved  by  the  painful  clash  between  the  Church  and  the  state,  longing  for  a                     solution (See ch. 3, no. 5).                          We confine ourselves to recalling two interventions by the Father on God and                     Neighbor, in a  momentous point of Italian history:  the defeat at  Caporetto in                     October l9l7.  It drove the armies of the central empires  to the bank of the Piave.                     They are two articles quivering with heartfelt patriotism.                          The    first    reminds  the  Italians  of  the  duties  toward    their  country  in  the                     momentous events.","THE HOUR OF DUTY FOR EVERYONE                           The  sudden,  unexpected  irruption  of the  enemy  army  in northen Italy,                     already  halted  by  our  valiant    soldiers,    imposes  everyone  to  ponder  on  the                     supreme hour of our duty.                          The  army  has the duty to valiantly battle and to make  the enemy  feel  that                     the Latin blood is stirring in  the  veins  of Italy's sons.  Such a duty is felt by                     each battalion,  or  better yet,  by  each soldier.  The strong resistance of our                     army  along with its counter-offensives proves it.                          Likewise,    responsible    are  the  politicians  and  the  military  who    are  at  the                     head of the civil and political life.  They  have fulfilled their duty by sacrificing                     themselves at work.                          Each  citizen must cooperate to achieve the victory  and  to defend the nation,                     either by money, or by saving the orphans, or by  cultivating  the  fields.  The                     press and  other  means  must encourage the soldiers and the civil resistance.                          The  believers,    the  Catholics,    and  the  clergy  must    combine  action    with                     prayer to God and the most holy Virgin so that  our beloved  country may have                     its frontiers safe,  and  become  great among the nations.                          The  most sacred duty of checking corruption,  cursing,  and profanation of                     holydays is incumbent on those who have the  power to  do  so.  We must be                     convinced  that  the  God  of  the    armies    is  above    weapons  and  armies.    The                     aspirations  leading  us  to  war  may  be    legitimate,    but    we  must  weed  out   659                     forgetfulness of  God  and anything  which hinders divine blessing.  Since the                     beginning  of the  war,  War  Office enacted laws forbidding  the  soldiers  to                     curse.  Why  didn't it forbid all of the citizens?  Why didn't it threaten  and inflict                     a punishement?  A Catholic nation  is  more responsible for it than a non Catholic                     one.                          Therefore,  each  citizen has a duty to forbid cursing among his employees,  to                     warn the blasphemers, to check corruption, and to  observe  holidays.  Women                     should give up  wearing  low-necked dresses.  When  we fulfill our duties toward                     God,    we  render    the  best    service  to  our  dear  country  for  its    victory,                     improvement, and prosperity among the nations\" (S.C. Vol. l, page l95).                           When    the  troops  were  withdrawing,    some  soldiers  dispersed.  Tiredness,                     hardship,  and  fear  moved them to  throw  down  the weapons   and desert.                     While  recomposing  the  army,    the  government  invited  the  deserters  to  appear                     within a certain period of  time, promising  amnesty  to all of them.  Then the                     Father published  the following:","WARM CRY TO THE DISBANDED                           We beg pardon to the Rev.  priests if we appeal not only  to our  readers  and                     Anthonian zealots,  but also  to  the  zealous ministers  of  the Lord,  asking them                     to double their efforts  in recruiting the soldiers who are not where they should                     be.                          We do not say that the deserters number many. Their affection  to  the  family,                     or an instant of fear (of  which  an Italian  soldier should be ashamed) deranged                     their  mind,  making them  desert their posts! Fortunately,  the heroic resistance                     of our  army proves how much solid and convinced the  soldiers  are, and their                     counter-offensive will make the Latin valor shine more.      However, all of us                     must be interested in the soldiers who did not appear yet.                          The  royal government along with the War Office has promised amnesty to                     the deserters.  It has already  delayed twice the time of their appearance,  and                     most of them have returned.  Those  who have   not,  are  threatened  with a                     shooting at their  backs  as traitors of their country.                          Each Italian who endeavors to find and urge the deserters to appear, renders a                     patriotic and evangelical work. Let us find and make  the  deserters  consider                     what a contemptible shame   it  is deserting  the post at the front.  It is a brand of                     infamy  which will be recorded to the deserters' generations. They must be told                     that  if all of the soldiers had done as they did,  the doors  of the Italian cities                     were  opened  and  all  of  us  were  prey  and  slaves  of  the  insolent  enemy  who    660                     changes our temples into barns.                          The  deserter  must be shaken and brought back.  He must  be told that the                     shooting at his back is sure if he does not appear, and  is  more  terrible than                     dying gloriously in  the  fields  of honor.  Besides, we have to die, and a beautiful                     death honors the whole  life! But,  who knows if he will die in the  war.  Do  all                     soldiers  die?    Aren't  there  so  many  of  them  who  shared  in  several  campaigns                     without having even been wounded?                          We have to teach the poor deserters that God protects  those who do their duty                     and trust in him; that to suffer and to work in obedience  to the chiefs in service                     to the homeland is a holy job worthy  of  eternal good.  Still,  taking for  granted                     that    the  soldier    is    going  to  die  while  doing  his  duty    submissively    and                     courageously,   he    must be sure that he has eternal life assured.  He will be a                     martyr. His memory will be honored and blessed.                          Plenty  of soldiers fallen on the battlefields defending our beloved  Italy  are                     in  heaven  and  are  enjoying  the  eternal beatitude  in the bosom of God! Our                     Lord Jesus Christ  sanctified our  love  for  homeland  when  he  cried  over  the                     unfaithful  Jerusalem,    foreseeing  its  destruction.  His  tears  say,  \"Love  your                     country.  If your blood is needed, give it!\" If our warm cry convinces one soldier                     to appear, it will make us happy for","having done  a work  of love for our country,  and a work of charity  for our                     neighbor.  We,  however,  hope  to  convince more  than  one soldier!  Such a                     satisfaction we hope for our  readers,  zealots, and  Italian priests! Our clergy is                     already conspicuous  for  its heroism  in  the battlefields;  we hope that it will add                     another glorious  crown of patriotism by bringing back the  deserters  to their                     post.                          Our    war    male    and  female  orphans  -  innocent    and    glorious  progeny                     dwelling  in the Anthonian institutes - are  praying  to Saint  Anthony.  May he                     drive out the enemy who was reaching  his sanctuary,  and to bring back to the                     army the dispersed  children of Italy!                          We  quote  the verses that our sublime  Poet  Felix  Bisazza wrote years ago,                     and  we  apply  them  to  this  war  as  though  the  poet  were  repeating  them  from                     heaven for our beloved Italy:(4)                                Watchful spirit, to your sacred tents                          I will sing new, warlike odes,                          A coward is the man who sells himself to the foes                          And throws away his weapons!                                Coward is the land that its pomp forgets,                          That does not shudder, nor grow pale in the shame,                          But you are Italy, and as you were before                                            661                          Still Italy You are!                           The  article  excited a reaction in those of the clergy  who considered  the                     Italian army as usurper of the pontifical  state, and  therefore  they condemned                     the    Father's    patriotism.    Father  Vitale  informed  the  Servant  of  God,  who                     answered form Trani:                           As  to  my article  for the deserters:  the bishop  of  Oria found  it  excellent,                     and praised it very much! I  realize  that people are divided by various opinions,                     and  I  acknowledge  that  it  was    patriotic.    But  it  was  also  evangelical  since                     preventing  a soldier  from being shot in the back and from infamy is a greater                     charity.    People  should  take  into  consideration    that.    Nowadays,    so    many                     bishops  speak  out  patriotically  even  in  the  church    for  matters  less  important,                     like the loan,  etc.  It is true that  I reached  so  far  as  to  assure  the  soldiers  of                     the    eternal  salvation,      etc.    I    follow    the    opinion    of    learned    men    and                     theologians,  such  as  Ventura and Faber(5) who hold  that  most people are                     saved,  and a few ones are lost! Well, if this happens in ordinary life,  what can                     we say of the extraordinary expiation in  the war?  It is understood that the word                     martyr  has  been  used  poetically,  not  theologically!  In  theological  terms,    we                     cannot call one martyr without having evidence! (Vol. 32, page 97).","13. Toward the benefactors                              We have already seen how grateful the Father was toward God; now we see                     how grateful he was toward his benefactors.                          \"He  showed his gratefulness to his friends not only  during their life, but also                     after their death.\"                          \"He  recommended us to be grateful toward our benefactors by praying  for                     them,  and  toward  our  superiors  by  prayer  and submission.\" \"Coming back                     from  begging,    he  often  exhorted  us    to  pray  for  the  generous  donors.\"  \"He                     recommended us to pray for our benefactors.\"  \"He overwhelmed his benefactors                     with blessings and personal  prayers,  also making other people pray for them.\"                     \"We have special prayers,  also daily ones for our benefactors.\"  \"He reciprocated                     the  proof  of friendship with  prayer  and  sacred gifts.\" Says Prof.  Gazzara, \"He                     was a friend, and so grateful to me  for  my  teaching  in  his  institute.  When                     the  city  hall transferred  me  far from Messina,  he wrote to the  prefect  who                     stopped  my  removal.\" \"Out of Christian  friendship,  plenty  of people  helped                     him in his labors,  and he reciprocated with money or  various  gifts.  He  used to                     say the mass  in  favor  of  the benefactors.\"   \"When  he  was in a city or town                     and  knew  of  a benefactor  dwelling  there,  he  felt obliged  to  manifest  his                     gratitude by giving his regards and paying visits to him.\"                                662                          \"For  sake of gratitude toward his friends,  he made us list the  benefits from                     the friends in a special note-book so that  we might reciprocate with temporal or                     spiritual return. At the death of Lawyer Picciotto,  who helped me so much in my                     vocation,  the Father  told me to reciprocate with prayers and good works\"   \"He                     reciprocated  the  benefactors with prayer,  and also with  gifts such as sweets on                     the main religious feasts and on their  saint's name. Among the benefactors he                     numbered  the  confessors.  As  to  the  chaplains,    he  used  to  give  them  a  more                     generous offering for the mass.\"  \"He felt obliged to manifest his gratitude to the                     persons who  helped the institute in any way.  When the","benefactors  were rectors  of  churches,  he  often gave them  sacred  pictures  or                     statues.  He  was  very  thankful toward  the  professionals  who rendered their                     service free of charge to the institute,  such  as lawyers,  or doctors.  He sent                     them sweets,  or other gifts. As a secretary,  I  was entrusted to write 'beautiful                     letters,' as  he used  to say,  to the generous persons.  In those times,   now and                     then  the  chime of the bells reminded us of praying  during  our work  for the                     benefactors who had sent more than fifty  liras.  I wrote  from  his  dictation                     several letters full  of  respect  to bishops and ecclesiastical superiors.\"                          Lawyer  Intonti of Trani was of great help to our institutes in Apulia,  and                     rendered  his  service  free  of  charge.    The    Father  wrote    to    him:    \"The  good                     services rendered with affection to  a community,  as you are doing long since for                     our  orphanage,  cannot  be  reciprocated  with  silver  or  gold,  but  with  the  deep,                     indelible feelings  of the most sincere gratitude.  Therefore,  we  implore graces                     and blessings from the Donor of all good.\" Then he  urges him to accept a little                     flower as \"a manifestation of the internal gratitude\" (Vol.  42,  page 74). After                     the purchase of Pappagallo palace,  he insists to know his fee.  \"We must keep in                     mind  that you  are a professional,  a father of family,  therefore we  must know                     what we have to do\" (Ibid. page 84).                          We  also  have evidences about his writing for  benefactors: \"He  wrote  some                     pieces  of  poetry  for  the  benefactors.\"    \"He    was  delicately  grateful  to  all  his                     benefactors,  as well as rich with words and even pieces of poetry sometimes.\"                          Let us remember a few of them.                                                       663                          At  the death of Grace Cucinotta,  who offered the patrimony for his sacred                     ordination,  the Father wrote a wonderful  funeral oration.                          Francis  Ciampa  of Piano di Sorrento (Naples),  \"a  man  of great  religious,                     civil,  and  domestic virtues,\" had rigged  l8 ships for his citrus fruit commerce,                     setting  aside    the  proceeds  of  one  of  them  for  charity.    The  Father  had                     experienced his great beneficence.  When  Francis  Ciampa  died,  the  Father                     wrote  a beautiful play in verses.  Three characters:   Faith,  Hope,  and Charity                     celebrate the merits of the famous dead.  The choir  of the orphaned girls ends                     the play:                               ...........................                               How many and many times                               He broke bread on our desk,                               And through his children,                               He consoled our worries!                               Oh, render to Francis                               What he gave us on earth.                                                        (Vol. 47, page 287)","Mr.  Mariano  Gentile left a legacy of 55,000 liras  to  the Father,  who  was                     enabled  to install the mill and  the  bakery, whereas Mrs.  Mary Pellegrino left                     her property. In a speech, the Father   says,   \"Gentlemen,   look  at  the  portraits                     of   our benefactors,  for  whom these orphaned girls pray every month  on the                     day of their transfer to the eternal rewards\" (Vol.  45, page 453).(6)                          With  deep emotion the Father remembers  Prof.  Louis  Costa Saya.                           He was a real lover of his homeland,  a real citizen, a real friend,  a brother of                     all,    a  father  of  the  poor,  a  tender  father  of  the  youth,    on  whose  perils  he                     mourned.  He was a faithful son of the church, a militant Catholic, a model of                     Christian life, an angel  in  human face (Vol.  45,  page ll5).  His  laboratory  of                     chemical analysis assured him big profits, but one day he read in the  gospel   the                     parable of the rich who plans to  increase  his stores,  and is told:  \"You fool!                     This very night your life shall be  required  of you.  To whom will all this piled-                     up  wealth  of yours go?\" (Lk.  l2,  20).   This reading renewed  the miracle of                     detachment from earthly things in that candid soul full of divine love.  From the                     beginning of the gospel, the saying, \"If you want to be perfect,  sell what you                     have,  give it up to the poor,  and follow me\" changed the readers into heroes                     (Vol. 45, page l20).                           Louis  Costa Saya makes his decision.  Because he is single, he will give up                     everything to the poor, making himself a poor. As to our institute, listen to the         664                     Father:                           My  humble  charitable  institutions  and   my   orphanages, especially  at                     their  start,  found in  him  a  great,  generous benefactor.  When broken hearted,                     I knocked at his door, I found him  always  cheerful and eager for helping me,                     sometimes   more than  I  hoped.  His  beneficence  was  a  main  factor  for  the                     foundation of my institutes. He loved them with affection, helped them up to the                     end,  and delighted in their progress (Ibid.  page l2l).                           We end this chapter with the remembrance of Msgr. Francis di Paola Carrano,                     Archbishop  of  Trani.    The  Father  says,    \"  I  loved  him  as  my    father,  and                     venerated  him  humbly\" (Vol. 45,  page l60). On the golden anniversary of the                     archbishop,  the orphaned  girls made  a  performance,  the Father had a speech,                     and praised  the archbishop's merits toward the institute.  He was like a founder.                     In fact, the orphanage began at the outbreak of the l9l0 cholera. Says the Father:","Can I keep silent   about the generous financing from your beloved archbishop?                     Not  only  did  he  give  up  this  ample  palace  of  great    value,    but    he  also                     contributed with 2,000 liras  to  the expenses of the installation.  Besides,  he                     gave up the income of the shops which are worth 20,000 liras; to increase the                     vacancies for the orphans,  he built an ample  second floor with  corridors and                     dormitories.  They are fit for decorously lodging 32 orphans, several  sisters,  and                     candidates  for    religious    life.    Despite  having  given  up  everything,  he  has                     shouldered  the property taxes and  has  provided for  the future of the institute in                     order  to perpetuate  it...   Gentlemen,  doesn't  all this constitute  the merit of the                     loving founder of this important house of  salvation for  so many orphans,  and of                     the laboratory for the education of the poor children of this city?  But I did not                     mention his  love, his  fatherly thoughtfulness,  his careful attention to the well-                     proceeding of this charitable institute. It forms his glory and a new  decorum  for                     the  city of  Trani  already  conspicuous  for religion and civilization\" (Ibid. page                     497).                           On that occasion the Father inaugurated an inscribed  marble tablet  with  the                     sculpture of the archbishop in low relief as  a memorial of his great merits.                        Notes                                                                                     665                              (l) In the rules,  the thought of Msgr. De Segur is analized in detail (Rogationist Anthology,                     page l04 and following).                           (2) In the Father's time Italy was a reign.                           (3)  The  Father was thinking of the Turks who  were  allied with the central empires.                           (4) The Father refers to Italy the verses that Bisazza  puts on the dying Byron's lips (l788-                     l824).  The English poet had gone to  Greece  to defend its freedom from the  Turks.  The                     original verses sound, \"But you are Greece, and as you were before - still Greece you are!\"                           (5) Father Joachim Ventura (l792-l86l) of Palermo,  superior general of the Theatine Fathers,                     was a renown preacher, nicknamed the  Italian  Bossuet.  Involved in politics,  he  supported                     the  Guelph  idea  of  Gioberti,  acknowledged  the  Roman  republic  of  l849,  and  at  its  fall  took                     refuge in France, where he died.","Father    William    Frederic    Faber    (l8l4-l863),      an    English  ascetic    writer    and  Newman's                     companion,  became a  Catholic  and published very effective books on asceticism, such as:                          Tutto    per  Gesu',    Il  Creatore  e  la  creatura,    Betlemme,    Il  piede  della  croce,  Il  SS.                     Sacramento, Conferenze spirituali, etc.                           (6)  In the notes after the speech,  the Father  appeals  to public charity.  \"Each owner who is                     free to dispose of his goods, should  not  forget these orphanages.\" Since none should fail  in                     justice,  he specifies, \"I have said,  'Each owner who is free to dispose of his goods,'  because                     those  who  are  bound  to    relatives  or  others,    they  must  think  of  them  first.  We  respect  the                     saying: 'The  soul  to God,  and the goods to whom they  belong'\"  (Ibid. page. 455).                                                                                                                              666","2l                                                                              FORTITUDE                                              l.

Definition                              While prudence and justice regulate the relations with  our neighbor, fortitude                     and temperance put order within ourselves.                          Let  us  see  how  the  masters  of  spiritual  life  define fortitude.                           It  is  the  moral  virtue  that  strengthens    the  soul  in  its  aim  at  achieving  the                     difficult  good,    keeping  the  person  calm  even  in  the  presence  of  very  serious                     obstacles. It overwhelms the fear of great dangers,   labors,  adverse criticism,                     and everything which could paralyze our effort in our achieving good. it keeps us                     from  giving  in  when  we  must  fight,  and  moderates  the  untimely  audacity  and                     excitement, preventing us from rashness.                          This virtue shows  up with our engaging  in and our facing the  hard  things                     courageously.  The Christian has to  tolerate  such things out of love for God,                     knowing that it is harder to tolerate them for long time than to engage in them in                     a  fit  of  enthusiasm.  When  we  bear  the  hardship  of  life  with  calm  without                     complaint, we join fortitude with patience;  when we tolerate things for a long                     time,  we  join longanimity;  and when we persevere in the  good, opposing  the                     strong  evil,    we  practice    perseverance.    Fortitude  also  implies  the  virtue  of                     magnanimity,    which  drives  the  soul  to  achieve    great    things    without       668                     cowardliness  and  weakness.  It prevents  it  from  falling  into  presumption,                     vainglory,  and ambition  (Garrigou-Lagrange,  Le tre eta' della vita  interiore,                     Vol. IV-V, page l50).                           Furthermore:                           Fortitude   urges   us   to  foster   Christian   life   and sanctification through                     the  hardship,    resisting  up  to  the  end.  It  implies  a  combination  of  things  that                     make this virtue attractive.  The  person resolute to make progress must take the                     bull  by  its horns,  he needs guts, and even some aggressiveness in facing the                     obstacles.  He must dare with Christian initiatives and patience. To be faithful for                     a day is easy, but to be so for months, years, and  all  life  is  difficult.  The time                     factor    is    a    heaviest  dimension    of  sanctification.    Some  people  say,  \"Isn't                     martyrdom itself easier than","climbing the Carmel?\" Fortitude  implies  to hold fast,  to wait untiringly,  to bear                     hardship,    to  face  pains  and    drawbacks,    to  suffer  scorn,    opposition,    and                     threats\"  (G. Thils,  Santita' cristiana,  Compendio di teologia ascetica, page 309).                        2. He was strong                              Did the Father's fortitude shine? To begin with, we foretell our  readers  that                     for  the  details  regarding  several    events,    we  sometimes  confine  ourselves  to                     hints,  referring to the  existing  or future biographies.                          We start from the general evidences.                          The  Father  \"showed Christian fortitude by strongly  facing the obstacles he                     met in promoting his important enterprises.\" \"He showed his fortitude since his                     taking of the cassock, against the will  of  his  mother.\" \"His moral  suffering                     was  various  and profound,  but  he never revealed it.  Sometimes he hinted at its                     gravity  when I submitted mine,  and he asked me  questions  like this:  'Did you                     ever ask the Lord to die in these circumstances?' On  another  occasion he told                     me  mildly:    'This  is  nothing'!\"    \"I  think  that  he  feared  the  Lord  only,  and                     overwhelmed the obstacles in  saving  the  people by trusting childlike in  God.\"         669                     \"He    met  plenty    of    difficulties  in  the  foundation  of  his  institutes    and                     overwhelmed  them  by trusting in prayer,  not in himself  or  in human means.\"                          \"He  used to overcome the frequent physical and  moral  hard suffering  with                     deep recollection and confident surrender to God. Joining his palms and bowing                     his head,  he said,  'God's will  be done'!\" Let us read  trenchant evidence.  \"The                     Servant of God was an  oak,  not  a reel.\" He had to  overcome  great   difficulties                     during his life,  but he concealed them in his heart. However, he always  asked us                     to pray to the Lord that he might overcome them. More  than once we heard of                     grave news concerning the  institute, but  we  never realized any worry on the                     Servant of  God's  face, because  he  welcomed and talked to us with his usual                     smile  and calm.\"                          \"He showed an adamantine fortitude in manifesting his religious ideas   and in                     applying them to his institutes.\"  \"Hunger,","injustice,    and    opposition  were  the  great  obstacles  he    overcame                     magnanimously.\"  \"He  did not pay homage to  human  respect;  his strength  was                     prayer.\" \"The blooming institutes he  founded  show his fortitude.\"                          \"He    was  never  irresolute...    By  only  seeing  him,    we    could  figure  out  a                     Servant  of  God.  His  great  trust  in  the  Lord  made  him  stay    firm  in  the                     adversities;  anyone else  would  have  become discouraged.\"                          Writes  the  Father's  niece,    \"My  mother  told  me  that  he  never  was                     disheartened;    he  rather  bore  everything  with  gladness,    even  when    he  was                     lacking bread for the orphans.\" Full of faith as  he was,  he  faced the difficulties                     with trust and overcame them  by prayer  and  patience.  \"He suffered so much,                     but  always  with    a  strong    spirit.\"    \"He  had  to  overcome  great  difficulties                     because both  priests and laymen didn't believe him.  Even his  relatives opposed                     him.  But he was strong and won the esteem of  everyone.\" \"Convinced  of  the                     good cause,  he got to  its  bottom  without worrying about difficulties. He faced                     plenty of them from men and circumstances in the foundation of his institutes\"                        3. The Avignone Quarter                                                                                                                  670                          The  great  enterprise  the Father  undertook  successfully, which made his                     fortitude  shine,  is  the  foundation  and  development  of    two    religious                     congregations.      Their  hard  origin  in  the  notorious  Avignone  Quarter  is                     realistically  described  by  him  in  the  preface  to  Precious  Adhesions  (l922                     Edition).  To confirm it, we report several evidences.                          Professor  Vincent Lilla stigmatized  with harsh  words  the moral   disorder                     of  the  quarter  (Canon  Di  Francia  and  his Charitable Institutions, Messina,                     Tipografia S. Giuseppe l902).                           In a distant corner of Messina, a bunch of old hovels give a resting place to                     human beings! The beasts' resting place could be envied by that","quarter's dirty women bargaining their  body  and conscience... (page ll). In that                     patch of cursed land the absence of  any  principle of morals and religion gave                     room  to  indecent unions.  They  didn't pay any respect to decency,  and the                     mating among  relatives broke the rights of blood.   Lust and  obscenity appeared                     in the most filthy,  monstrous,  infamous form. It was a barbarian state without                     culture,  and awareness of human dignity. Even  the  dim light of common sense                     had been  extinguished  from that  tainted  place...  A herd of beasts dwelled in                     that  place. Indeed,  man  without  reason and light of faith is less  than  a beast.                     In  this place,  instinct existed in the place of  reason (page l4).                           Such  a  picture  is  implemented  by  relations.    \"The  social  and  moral                     environment  of the people was formed by  illicit  unions, scurrilous language,                     contagious disease, damp hovels, a sense of horror against the Christian religion,                     and by the comptent of the public opinion.  It was an insult to say, 'You should                     live in the Avignone houses,' or merely 'Mignunaru'!\"                           \"Avignone Quarter: a bunch of dirty, narrow  hovels giving a nightly shelter                     at the price of ten cents to the homeless of  the city such as drunkards,  thieves,                     beggars,  and prostitutes. The owner:  Knight Avignone, who earned his living                     from the rent. The children  of Avignone Quarter were the first element of Canon                     Di Francia's institutes'.  It is unbelievable how the Servant of God overcame  the                     natural,  physical,  and moral  repugnance  against that environment.\"                    671                           It was over half a century since Messina was offering such a view  of moral                     and material depravation,  when Deacon Di  Francia set food in that place.  There                     he began improving the  conditions in order to plant the seed of his charitable                     institutions and two religious  orders.  But  he  had  to spend plenty  of  time                     with patience, and heroic fortitude!                       4. Difficulties                            Listen  to the Father making a synthesis of the difficulties he faced.                           Everyone knows the serious difficulties opposing the Lord’s works; humanly                     speaking,  these  difficulties   sometimes  seem insuperable","The person who starts such institutions has to fight four battles:                          l.    He    has  to  fight  against  those  who  oppose  him,    and    the  external                     oppositions    such    as    censures,      persecutions,      and  disapprovals  sometimes                     coming  from  good  people.    Some  of  them  say  that    the  person  starting  such                     institutions  is    mad;    others    say  that  the  work  will  come  to  nothing  with  his                     death, while the lack of   resources,   want,   defections,   ingratitude,   a  hundred                     difficulties, and vicissitudes make matters worse.                          2.  The starter has to fight with himself.  He grows feeble, seems to fail, sees                     the enterprise as though it were unattainable owing  to  his  spiritual  weakness.                     On  the  other  hand,  the enterprise requires  strength,  sacrifice,  perseverance,                     faith,  confidence,      sacred    enthusiasm,      want,      tolerance,    prudence,                     longanimity,  and dissimulation;  in short,  self-denial is to be practiced at any                     moment.                          3.  Meanwhile  one fighter is battling by day and by  night, extrinsically  and                     intrinsically,    by  means  of  other  human  beings  and  our  own  passions:    he  is                     Satan!  The battle against the power of darkness is so hard and tremendous that                     the apostle Saint Paul said:  “For we are not fighting against human being, but                     against the wicked spiritual forces in the heavenly world, the rulers, authorities                     and cosmic power of this dark age” (Eph. 6, l2).                           Satan fears nothing else as much as the foundation of a charitable or religious                     institution which aims at God's glory and salvation of souls.  Such a foundation          672                     for  him,  is  like  the foundation  of the Church:  the anger and the fury which                     blinded him  at  the  Church's birth return.  What doesn't  hell  try  to preclude  in                     the foundation of such institutes?  To  resist  and overcome  the hellish powers,                     people  need  to  provide    themselves  with  God's  help,    the  weapons  of  faith,                     Christian wisdom, prayer, pure intention, honest conscience, and wise counsels.                          4.  But  a  very  surprising battle defies  the  institute's starter:  it is the battle                     Jacob fought with the angel, with God. Even though the founder is nothing else                     but a weak, useless tool, since  only God is the author of any good work,  still                     God  works with  this tool! But He wants immolation,  and  Jesus wants us to                     imitate  him.  Our Savior fought with the justice of his eternal Father when \"he                     made his prayers and requests with loud cries and tears to God\" (Heb.  5,  7).  He                     did so all his life long, on the mountains and in the graves,  immolating himself                     on the altar  of his divine heart.  In his terrible agonies, \"he prayed even more                     fervently\" (Lk. 22, 43); so did he while combining his blood with his burning                     tears until his last breath.  The prophet had foretold:  \"Would anyone plead his                     cause?  Yes, he was torn away from the land of the living\" (Is. 53, 8).                          God  shapes the institute and its members through privation, wails,  sobs, and                     sacrifice; with one hand he sustains the feeble tool,  with the other he trains the                     tool for the fight;  with one hand  he  gives  the  necessary help,  with  the  other                     he  bars additional  help,  often blocking the way with","cut stones as  the prophet  Jeremiah complained:  \"He has blocked my ways  with                     cut stones, he has obstructed my paths\" (Jer. Lam. 3, 9).                          In  the  midst  of  these troubles man  comes  to  know  his inability, his                     nothingness; he begins to distrust, to  humiliate, and  debase  himself;  he realizes                     that he is an obstacle to  any good,  and as Moses,  he perhaps implores, \"Lord,                     send anyone you will\" (Ex. 4, l3). All paths seem closed. Heaven seems defiant,                     a thousand  doubts  call  in question the work,  as  an  output  of foolhardiness                     and over-confidence, even prayer seems useless. God seems  to have withdrawn                     himself in order  to punish  infidelity, interposing a cloud so that prayer may not                     reach    him.    According  to  the  prophet  Jeremiah's  saying:  \"You  have  wrapped                     yourself in a cloud too thick for prayer to pierce\" (Jer. Lam. 3, 44). And yet, that                     is the proper time to wail and sob before divine mercy from the  profound abyss                     of one's own misery, \"for we do not know  how we ought to pray;  the Spirit                     himself pleads with God for us,  in groans that words cannot express\" (Rom. 8,                     26).                          That is the time to uphold God's wise delays:  \"Cling to him and do not leave                     him\" (Eccl.  2,  3);  this is the proper time to endure the mysterious battle for self                     annihilation,  the time  of  wails,  sobs, petitions, and any sacrifice so that these                     words of the Psalmist, \"put  your hope in Yahveh, be strong, let  your heart be                     bold\" (Ps. 27, l4) may come true.                          At  last,  the  fight  with  the angel ends  with  a  strong embrace,  but Jacob                     states,  \"I will not let you go,  unless  you bless me\" (Gen.  32,  26). The event        673                     comes to terms with copious, divine blessings,  which are as much abundant as                     long and hard is the mysterious fight.                          It was God who was planting, not people (Precious Adhesions, pages 6-8).                           What  the Father says,  is not a doctrinal teaching,  nor  a rule  of  ascetic                     theology,  but is the story he  lived  in  the foundation of his institutes. Listen to                     him:                           \"The  four  difficulties,   which  surrounded  this   little charitable institute                     since its start,  have been growing,  always with   more  complication  of  things                     and  the  interlacing   of circumstances.  The  institute has been surrounded by a                     vortex of tribulations  which  brought it at the point of death  a  hundred times                     before being completely born.  How many times I felt myself exclaiming, “The                     waters went over my head; I said, I am lost\" (Jer. Lam. 3, 54). (S.C. Vol. l0, page                     2ll).","5. Charity for our Lord, out of love                              Let us consider a few details.                          The  Avignone Quarter \"had become an opprobrious name to the city\" (S.C.                     Vol.  l0, page 207), and \"none dared to set foot in that place of abomination\"                     (Precious Adhesions, page 5).  The Father  said,  \"When  Father  Ciccolo  paid                     his  first  visit  to Avignone  Quarter,  he was so shocked that he left  troubled                     and pale.\"                          The  Servant  of God was not satisfied by paying a  fleeting visit,  but  \"buried                     and immolated himself there.  He  \"perceived that no better place could make                     him practice some charity out  of pure  love  for our Lord Jesus,  who loves so                     much the  poor  and wants them to be saved\" (Precious Adhesions, page l5).                          To  tell  the truth,  not everyone could have  the  Father's heroism;    therefore,                     people   began   misunderstanding   and contradicting him.                          Humanly speaking,  his relatives, friends, laymen and clergy who  left  him                     and  began calling him   mad,  were  not  utterly wrong...  Even the relatives of                     Jesus who looked at his  humanity only,  began  disapproving his apostolate and                     came to take charge of him, saying, \"He is out of his mind!\" (Mk. 3, 2l).                          The  opposition  of  his  mother to his  clerical  life  was motivated  by  her      674                     wish to  continue  Di  Francia's  name.  This opposition   grew up when he started                     the mission in the notorious Avignone Quarter.  It was unthinkable for his family                     that Marquis Di Francia end up to that cursed land. His complete commitment to                     the physical and moral redemption of the Avignone mob amazed  the orthodox,                     the  clergy,   and  the  cathedral's  chapter.   Such difficulties  were  hard,  but  he                     overcame them  by  using  his weapons: prayer and the archbishop's blessing.                          Since  the  beginning  of  his  apostolate  in  Avignone,    friends,  acquaintances,                     and  quite  a  few of the  clergy  endeavored  to convince  him that his enterprise                     was queer and unfeasible  owing to","his  literary culture and oratorical gifts.  But he  was  not terrified.  He  rather                     went to Naples to meet Father  Ludwig  of Casoria,  as well as to a holy nun,                     who encouraged him by saying that his enterprise was from the Lord.                          \"I  feel as though I am now listening to him confessing  his great  difficulties,                     such  as lack of means,  or  relating   the discussions  with his relatives and other                     persons who disapproved his  utopia...\"  After  hinting  to  the  obstacles,   a                     sister continues,  \"He  tolerated  these difficulties  with  calm,  mild smile, and                     trust in the Lord. When he was in trouble, he rang the bell and gathered all of us                     in the chapel to pray with him.\" \"The obstacles  were  various,  such as lack  of                     money,  cooperators, building...  but  even  in  the midst of such things  his  spirit                     remained serene... He trusted in God.\"                          Lack of means was a great obstacle.  But he was always calm, because  his                     help was the Lord...  More than often and  suddenly, when circumstances were                     pressing, we youth were invited by him to pray in the chapel \"                          \"The  Servant  of  God  faced  contradiction  and  misunderstanding  from    his                     brethren,  for the newness of his work.\" \"Obstacles  of any  sort notwithstanding,                     he succeeded to  evangelize  Avignone Quarter  and  was  always loved for his                     virtues,  above  all  his charity  toward the poor.\"  \"I was very amazed at seeing                     priests and lay persons whom he had helped, grumbling against and calling him                     crazy    and  imprudent.    I  think  that  the  Servant  of    God    was  aware  of  these                     opinions, but he bore that in silence.\"                                                                                                               675                         6. Dating back to the origin                              Prof. Lilla describes the pitiable situation of the Avignone people. He gives a                     hint of the Father's plan to free those wicked spirits  from degradation and to                     plant the flag of Jesus  Christ. Then  he defines the Father's plan:                           \"A  dangerous  enterprise,  a path strewn  with  thorns  and afflictions. But the                     Servant of God did not lose his heart in the presence of","difficulties.  The    hand of the  Most  High,  who pierces  and shines through the                     universe,  helped  him.  Full  of strong  faith and aware of the gospel's teaching                     that  the  man    of  faith  can  say  to  the  mountains  to  move,    and  they  obey,  he                     became more  inflamed with zeal.  He overcame the obstacles and  carried out                     his generous plan.  But he hoped for the cooperation of  the few  good,   in  vain.                     Furthermore,  his  plan  was  considered unfeasible and the pious planner was                     scorned.  Whoever places his trust  in  the  mutable  wills of men,  is unable  to                     lead  such institutions.                          Others  considered the institution utopia,  and such  as  to fail  for  lack of                     means.  Even worse,  the planner had to  fight against  the  owners of those slums                     who  by    greed    increased    the  value  of  their  hovels,    and  dejected  Canon                     Hannibal M. Di Francia in  the  execution  of his plan.   While the  charitable                     persons should  contribute to  the expenses of this holy work blessed  by heaven,                     the  egotists  who  have erased the image  of  God  from themselves dare to trade                     on the works of Christian  philanthropy. Resolute  to  root out the vice and to                     plant the virtue  in   that place, the Servant of God overpaid those hovels  and                     spent most of his estate to lay the foundation of his institute.                          Even  though  the  following  comparison  is  inadequate,  it  still  has    a                     resemblance.    Christopher  Columbus  defended  his  point    of  view  with                     unshakable faith and good humor against the scientists, the  politicians,  and the                     population of  his  time.  Unshakable, Canon  Di  Francia resisted dangers and                     fights by  seeing  things from above and very differently from common people.             676                     Through this faith,  he  firmly  laid the foundation of the  pious  institute, which                     is reaching such proportions as to rise the admiration  of the honest\" (Ibid. page                     l2).                           We  glean additional evidences:  \"The institution started at Avignone with the                     evangelization of the poor. They met the Father with indifference,  derision,  and                     hostility.  In the  beginning, Canon  Ciccolo endeavored to help him by inviting                     the aristocracy of  the  city to that place.  They were amazed  at  the  Father's                     heroism, and disgusted by the environment.\"                          Says Father Russello,  \"When I came over here,  I knew  from the  first priests                     that the Servant of God had  suffered very  much from various parts.  Marquis                     Avignone said that he wouldn't  give his  slums;  the  poor did not accept the                     Father's   material  and moral plan;  they  rather strained a rope in  the alley to                     make  him  fall.    The    Servant  of  God,    however,    was  always  subordinate    to                     God's  will.  Quite  a  few  people said that he  was  unable  to administer the two                     communities,  even though he may be a  saint.\" Nevertheless,  he  always  trusted                     in Providence,  and was  never deceived.  As far as I know,  he was always alone                     in the fight. \"The bad finance,","lack of subjects,  the  departure  of  Father Ciccolo,  and  the criticism of his                     priests friends were a  great test for him.\"  \"I know that at the beginning of the                     congregation he  suffered so much for lack of personnel and for the  departure of                     a few cooperators.\"                        7. Penury                              To  go  ahead with the institution,  the Father had to  face hard difficulties.                          First,  he  began  facing  the consequences of his  work  by depriving himself                     of  his  goods.  His  niece  testifies,  \"He  used  his  furniture  and  real  estate  at  the                     beginning of the institution.  I remember  that he sold the lands of Saint Stephen                     and  Contesse.\"  But,  they were a drop of water in the desert... Hence, the daily                     worry  of  the  Father  and  his  heroic  fortitude.    Despite    coldness,                     misunderstanding,  commiseration,  and opposition around him,  he never drew                     back.                          The  maintenance  of  the  orphans  and  the  institutes  abundantly  proves      the                     founder's  heroic fortitude.  The  Father  suffered scarcity  of  means until the         677                     devotion of Saint  Anthony's  bread developed.  For  so  many  years he knocked                     at the  door  of  the  people,   who  more  than  once  acted  rudely,   increasing                     the bitterness  of their rejection.  The sisters shared with him  the begging  and                     the  rejection.  One of them  narrated  that  after knocking at the door of a lady,                     she opened and cried, \"Still you tormenting  me?  Right  now the crazy Father                     Francia   came  over here.\"                          The  poor  lady  did  not  realize  that  her  torment  in    listening  to  Canon  Di                     Francia who asked for help was less than the Father's torment. He, an educated                     man of noble family was begging.                          The    Father    once  appealed  to  Don  Bosco  for  financial    help.  The  saint                     answered  through  Don  Rua  that  his  debts  were  bigger    of  many  zeros,    but                     exhorted him to resort to the press.  The Father followed his advice and said that                     Don Bosco was inspired.                          Listen  to the Servant of God himself,  who makes a faithful representation of                     the institute in a petition to the child  Jesus on Christmas l889.","My sweetest Lord, you already know it, but let me state it to you.  This                     pitiable  crowd  of  children  resides  here  in  a    place  conspicuous    for    poverty                     which  is  so  dear  to    you;    but    it    is  unfitting  for  institutes  because  of  its                     narrowness and unsanitary conditions.  It is moist,  dirty, out in all weather, and                     unsafe. And  yet, O Lord, how dear  we pay for such poverty and misery! The                     price  amounts up to 3,000 liras a year,  besides maintenance and remodeling!                     You know, O Lord, if we have had income enough to pay off for the excessive                     rent.  O very adorable child Jesus, on this night of your anniversary I place at                     your feet this humble letter begging  you  to  consider  the  pitiable  state  of  this                     Pious Institution!  From the innermost of my heart I beg you,  O  Lord, \"Speed                     up the time of your divine mercy!\" (Vol. 4, page 40).                           The Father was burdened with debts for so long,  even though his  creditors                     were tolerant with him,  a few cases excepted.  \"I think that the Father had no                     occasion to forgive injury,  because he  was never insulted;  even his creditors                     delayed his  payment. When  any  of them was disappointed,  the following day                     he  made friends again understanding the Father's situation and the  great good                     he was operating.\" \"I knew that everyone was devoted to the Father,  save  some                     poor who inveighed against  their  benefactor because  they  were not satisfied in                     all of their  demands.\"  The Father had no enemies; everywhere he won esteem                     and affection. \"I remember  that  he was often sieged by creditors,  but he  calmly                     assured  them that he  would pay off.  Sometimes I noticed that  a few of his             678                     creditors kissed his hand as though they were  begging pardon for their request,                     even though they had received nothing.\"                          Creditors,  however,  did  not  dispense him from doing  his duty.  He  tried all                     the ways.  Untiring beggar for  charity,  he knocked at all doors to comply with                     his duty.  Then the Lord  had to  supply the remnant!  We quote from the petition                     to the  \"King of the Ages,  King of Eternal Birth, Jesus, Supreme Goodness,\" on                     March l9, l904.                           I  stay  in  the  abyss  of  misery.  I  say  \"I  am  lost.\"  Jesus  very  clement,    have                     mercy  on  me!  Troubles  surround  me  from  everywhere;  a    tremendous                     responsibility    crushes  me;    financial    means    are  failing;    my    audacity  is                     crushing  down  on  my  head!  Which    way    I  turn  to  force  my  way  up,    I  find                     myself knocked down...  My Lord, save,  save  this institution! Powerful king,                     deal with us  with sovereign  and  generous  liberality  because  we  are  poor                     and oppressed!   My debts amount to 48,000 liras.  I am 54 years  old and  after a                     while I will appear before your tribunal.  My Lord, have","mercy on me! King very clement,  hear me! I have  not  the faith  which moves                     your charity,  nor have I the loving look that wounds your heart! I am surrounded                     by darkness of tribulation and misery.  In my hands, everything dies out. God                     very clement, save me! My creditors urge me,  l50 mouths ask for food, the sick                     need  drugs,    the  lives  perish,    the  sheltered  must  be  educated  in    the  civil,                     religious,  intellectual, artistic life. Which way I turn is barred.  Stunted and in                     need  of  help,  we  search  for  resources,  but    we  do  not  find  any.    God  very                     clement,  King very  merciful, Jesus, why do you close your ears to my wails? I                     am worthy of it, but  to  whom  should I appeal?  I hope,  hope  in  your  endless                     kindness...                          God    very  clement,    save  us,    grant  us  a  source  of  means,    a  source    of                     providence  to  pay  off  48,000  liras,    and  see    to    the  development  of  the                     institution, the purchase of the building, the formation  of four communities,  and                     the relief of the  poor!  My Jesus,  we  are  in  an embarassing situation,  but for                     you  one hundred  millions are like a cent! Please move the hearts  toward us...                     I'm  speaking  like a fool.  Forgive  me,  Lord.  If  this institution is not yours,                     nor of your glory, destroy it and your will be praised!                          I    would    not  ask  you  for  money  and  terrestrial    means;    but  necessity    is                     crushing us,  the institution is  not  formed,  and paying off our debts is a duty of                     justice! (Vol. 4, page 72).                                                                                                                679                          It was from prayer that the Father drew strength to  prevail over  any obstacle                     by  divine  help  and  human  cooperation.    To  form  the    institutes,    the    Father                     addressed  a  very  long  list  of petitions   to the whole paradise,  beginning with                     the most  holy Trinity  up  to  the holy souls in  purgatory.  He  did      so  with                     unshakable  trust and perseverance for years and  years...  After praying  with                     intense fervor,  imploring everything from God,  he promises:  \"I must double                     sacrifices,    labors,    prayers,  penance,  spiritual  industries,    and  practice  of                     humility\" (S.C.  Vol.  l0, page 49).                          We    remember  the  endless  petitions  to  the  most    holy    Virgin  and  Saint                     Joseph,  to whom he prayed with childish simplicity and filial trust when he was                     urged by necessity and had no way out.                          We  would have a crazy desire to say,  \"But who urged him to do  so?  He                     could  be satisfied by playing  the  canon,  as  his colleagues suggested to him...                     These,  however, did not have the Father's character!","8. Synthesis                              We  submit  to our readers a synthesis of the  remnant  main difficulties which                     hindered the Father's institution,  as we know from his biography.                          \"Opposition,  calamities,  and obstacles appeared since  the beginning  of the                     two  institutes.    The  chief  cause  of    opposition  was    the  notorious  Avignone                     Quarter that disheartened priests and volunteers who were willing to help him...                     Mrs. Jensen separated to  found another institution,  which does not exist any                     longer;  while      Marchioness    of    Cassibile    delayed      the      institution's                     development  for  five years by promising to the archbishop  that she would do                     everything.\"  \"The hard task of the institution  and the  Father's courage stand out                     in the fights from the city  hall and  the  political sects of Messina,  Francavilla                     Fontana,  and Taormina.\"                          The fight with the city hall of Messina was decisive.  After the eviction from                     the Brunaccini palace, there was no way out for the orphaned girls. Writes Prof.                     Lilla:                           The helpers of the institution and the good persons who  had at  heart       its                     fortunes  were  dismayed  because    everything    seemed  conspiring    against    it.                     Only  Canon Di Francia  was  undaunted, seeing the things in God and shining              680                     with perfect  serenity.  How could   you  keep  calm  in  the  midst  of  such  a                     ruin?   All circumstances  conspired against you.  No,  the man  inspired  by                     Providence  could  not  lose  his  trust  in  God;  his  institution  could  not  perish.                     Infernal was the city hall's fight when the proposal to give Canon Di Francia the                     Holy Spirit's convent was put to the vote.  Senators are good men, but the senate                     is a wild beast! All of  them liked him,  all of them promised their favorable                     votes, only to forget it in the Court  Chambers. To clear themselves they said,                     \"Padre Francia is a holy man, but he does not know how to administer\" (Ibid.                     page l7).                           However, he won this battle.                          To maintain the house of Taormina,  he fought several years. The city hall had                     leased the building to him, but the factious","threatened him  more  than once with  rescinding  the  contract. Furthermore,  to                     compel him to give in and  dismiss the  orphaned girls,  they  created obstacles.                     They even cut off the  drinking water,  forcing  the  sisters  to  draw  water  from                     the  public fountains. The Father was undaunted. He rather insisted with more                     perseverance until he signed a long lease contract.                          We  have  talked  of  the  pastor  in  Torregrotta  (ch.  l9,  no.  7).  The  Father                     demanded of the sisters to pay respect and docility to him, saving the autonomy                     of the religious discipline. He wrote to the mother general:                           Pastor Magliarditi is abusing too much. I have respected him and made the                     sisters do the same,  but he pushed things so far as to compel us to submit our                     reasons  to  the  archbishop,  who  will  be  in  Messina  tomorrow,  Tuesday.  The                     pastor wrote to me: \"Either the sisters go away,  or you appoint me as a rector of                     their church.\" I let him talk with the chancery office of Messina,  but now it's our                     turn  to act in the adorable name of Jesus.  Let us say  the rosary  to the most holy                     Virgin,  and on the feast of  Immaculate Mary we'll pray to her to settle the little                     church,  the sisters, and the poor miss (the owner who gave the sisters her houses,                     the land,  and  the church).  They are in need of help  and  comfort\" (Vol. 36,                     page l69).                           After  the  Father's  intervention at the  chancery  office, things were settled.                          Desertion  of the clerics.  A former cleric says,  \"I  think that  the desertion of   681                     the clerics was the greatest  obstacle  to the  Father.  Few  of  them entered  the                     seminary,    others,    the  religious  life,    someone  else  returned  to  the  world.    I                     remember  when    the    Servant  of  God  entered  the  refectory  and    said,      'The                     clerics  abandoned me!'  His sadness was ineffable.\" Scarcity  of personnel  was                     always  a greatest crux for the Father.  He  opens his heart to Don Orione:                           You  wrote  that  love  of  Jesus  is  crucifying  me,    and  I    wish.  The  spirit  is                     willing,    but  nature  is  weak!  Pray  for  me.    The  cup  of    bitterness  is                     incomprehensible  because  the  Lord  is  picking  up  several  persons  from  the                     institute  with  illness  and    death.    They  had    to  direct  and  guide  the  people                     sheltered.  Thus,  the useful persons decrease,  and those needy of help and guide                     increase! It always  happened since the beginning,  but now it's  worse.  What                     does it mean?  Does the Lord want to slip things out of my hands? For sure,  my                     sins are the cause of everything! Oh, I wish I knew the Lord's will (S.C. Vol. 7,                     page 2l).                           \"As to the Father's fortitude, I know that during the turmoil","of Francavilla Fontana he always kept a  perfect  calm, exhorted  us to imitate                     him,    and  to  pray.    And    yet,    the    civil  authority  closed  the  residence  in                     Francavilla,  and  threatened  the  institutes  of  Messina  with  consequences.\"  \"I                     remember  the  crucial  moment    of  the  fights  from  the  bosses  of  Francavilla                     against  the Servant of God, who transferred the orphaned boys to Messina. The                     bosses  in  return  almost carried off the  orphaned  girls,  and handed  them to                     the Daughters of Saint Anna who had a house under the  interference of the city                     hall.  The Servant of God was  very grieved,  but kept his calm. As a vengeance                     against  the  bosses  of  Francavilla,    the    institute  opened  a  laboratory  for  poor                     girls, who paid a tuition of about fifty cents a month, or nothing.\"                          The Father's fortitude shone \"in the dramatic  circumstances of the first world                     war,    when  several  of  the  youth  were  called  to  arms,    many  of  the  financial                     resources failed, and he was almost alone  in  governing the institutes.\" \"I never                     saw him afraid  in the presence of so many difficulties.  However,  during the                     l9l5 war he worried at the rumble of the airplanes,  and was terrified by eventual                     spread of gas.\"                          In  l9l9,  a fire broke out destroying the beautiful  wooden church donated by                     Saint Pius X after the earthquake.  Such a fire grieved,  but did not discourage the                     Father. \"I think that one of his  hardest  enterprises  was the building  of  Saint                     Anthony's church,  after the fire at the wooden church. Father Redento told me                     that    during  the  fire  the  Servant  of  God    kept    calm,    seeing  everything    as                     coming  from God.  In the  building  of  the  new temple,  money often failed, but        682                     he  never  disheartened.\"  When  the  fire    attacked    the  wooden  church  of                     Avignone,  the  people  got frightened  and  cried,  but  the Servant of God  kept                     perfectly  peaceful,  saying  to  all,  \"Let  us  adore  the  divine  will!\"    When  he                     informed  Father Palma about the sad event,  and wrote,  \"Let  us adore God's                     designs!\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 86).                          Writes Father  Vitale:                           \"This event was grievous,  but it did not destroy us. On the same night,  after                     jumping up from bed at the sound of the alarm, we met the padre covered with a                     cloak.  Warding off resentment of the disaster, he said:                          Hush!  Let us not ask,  let us not inquire as to 'why,'  but let us adore God's                     designs and trust in Him!\"                          A sister reports: \"When the wooden church burst into flames, I was grieved                     and busy, but the Father told me:  \"Calm,","calm. Do you  think that it happened by chance?  Who knows what  good  God                     will draw from this disaster!\"                         9. The separation of his brother                              Specifically,  we'll  remember  two of the Father's  gravest tribulations which                     date back to l897.  First,  the separation  of his  brother  Canon Francis,   and                     second,  the threat from  the chancery office of Messina to suppress the female                     order.                          Talking  about  the  separation of Canon  Francis  from  our  Founder, we                     leave  the  task  of  exhaustively  discussing  the  painful  event    to    the    future                     biographer    of    the    Father.    We    confine  ourselves    to  outline  it,    with  the                     intention of correcting  what someone else wrote cursorily and gamboling.                          In the life of Canon Francis (Il Padre delle orfane,   Casa editrice Nova Lux,                     Rome), Icilio Felici gets rid of the subject with the story of Tobit and the fly: the                     world is wide enough for both, we do not need to bother each other (page 86).                     Stanislaus  Rigano,  in  the  life  of  Sister  Veronica  Briguglio  (Sorriso  e  Luce,   683                     Capuchin  Sisters of the Sacred Heart,  Via  Asterio,  55,  Rome) looks  at  the                     subject from a specific point of  view:  the  two brothers  work together with the                     same  charisma    (they    think    so)  Their    providential  separation  made  them                     understand that each  of them  had  his  own  charisma  (page  32).   Without                     making  any distinctions  and sub-distinctions,  we can accept this point  of view                     on condition that we implement it.  The realization of  the personal  charisma is                     carried out according to one's own  nature, formation,  attitude,  practical  care,                     and mentality;  and also according to one's own humanity,  because all of us are                     children of Adam!                          The    chief  role  in  the  separation  was  played  by  Don    Francis  and  Sister                     Veronica Briguglio, in the world Natala (l870-l950), a youth  of  Roccalumera                     (Messina),  who had entered  the  Father's institute.  I  think that Rigano's work is                     seriously  documented, but  the  two  chapters   \"At   service  of  charity\"  and                     \"The  co-founder\"    regarding  our  case,    are  somewhat  fancy  or  based    on                     documents, which are not sure.(l)","First,  we  correct the dates.  We are told that  the  youth entered Avignone                     on  May  6,    l886,  took  the  garb  on  March  l8,  l887  with    the    name  of  Sister                     Veronica,  and professed on  March  l8, l889.  Felici goes further and writes,  \"It                     is  worthy  remembering  that    in    the  taking  of  the  garb  the  youth  kept  their                     Christian  name;    only    Briguglio  changed  her  name.    She  was    called    Sister                     Veronica  of  the  child  Jesus.  Four  youth  had   entered  the novitiate  a few                     months before,  but they professed together with the  group of Sister Veronica on                     March l889.  They were eight  in all. These circumstances, which seemed of little                     importance,  were  signs  from  Providence  to  bring  the  matter  to  an  issue                     unforeseen by human wisdom\" (page 96).                          We  are  in  the  presence of an old  fashion  staged  fame: everything  is                     extraordinary in the souls since  the  beginning. Time and trials will lead them to                     the height of the virtue.                          An  early list of the sisters states that Briguglio  entered Avignone  on  May 6,                     l888.  On May  9,  l888,   she  joined  the aspirants, and on March l8 entered the                     novitiate.                          No  one  can  say  that Briguglio  herself  dates  back  her entrance on May                     l886.  If this is the case, memory failed her. In fact,  she  testifies that when she                     entered  the  institute,  she found  four  sisters in charge of the education of  the                     orphaned girls.  She adds,  \"When I came in,  the sisters were directed by Miss                     Arezzo.\" Well, the first four sisters took the garb on March l8,  l887, and Miss                     Arezzo replaced Mrs. Jensen, who went away in the first months of l888.(2)                684                          We    do    not  know  when  Briguglio  professed.    A  list    of    l89l  numbers                     Briguglio  as a novice.  The first sisters professed  in March l892,  perhaps in the                     presence of Cardinal Guarino  (Lilla, Ibid.  page l5).  Probably, Briguglio was                     among them. Because she is  given  some preferences without evident reasons,  I                     say  that things happened quite the opposite.  In fact, Briguglio professed in l892                     together  with  Sister  D'Amore  and  Sister  Nazzarena  who  had  entered    the                     community in October l889,  and  the  novitiate,  in March  l890.  All of them                     professed  in  l892.    About  the  change  of  the    name,    Briguglio    is    always                     mentioned  as  Natala  in  the chronicles.  The change of the  names began in                     l892;  then she was called Veronica.                          Sister  Veronica was a begging sister first;  then she  took care of chores. The                     superior was Miss Arezzo even when the Father","transferred the community to Brunaccini palace.  When Miss Arezzo retired  at                     the end of June l892,  Sister Veronica  was  elected superior  of  the  few  sisters                     who  were  taking  care  of  the assistance  to the Rogationists in Avignone;  she                     intervened  now and  then at the Brunaccini community because Sister D'Amore                     fell ill and went outside for treatment.                          In  l895 the Brunaccini community moved to the Holy  Spirit. Some  time                     later,  the sisters living in Avignone left the house-keeping of the Rogationists,                     and moved to the Holy Spirit to form one  community.  On that occasion Sister                     Veronica ended  being  a superior.                          Rigano  is   misinformed  about the situation  of  the  Holy Spirit when he                     writes that it was full of insects \"which attacked the  poor orphans as with an                     assault...\" Rigano describes  Sister Veronica  \"busy in battling the insects  with                     self-denial.  This action manifested her charity,  fortitude, and the high spirit of                     service to which she had committed her life\" (page 27).                          The  author  makes Sister Veronica stand out over the  other sisters who were                     as much worthy as she was.                          From the opening of the Brunaccini community, a sister began distinguishing                     herself in piety,  activity,  faithfulness to  the institution,  and  self-denial.  She                     deserved the trust  of  the Founder,  and  was  entrusted to open the new house at                     the  Holy Spirit. She was Mary Nazzarena Majone.                          She  went  to  the Holy Spirit together with twelve  of  the older orphans and                     lodged in a room near the parlor.  The remnant rooms  were uninhabitable,  while          685                     the  best of the  building  was illegally  taken  over  by a family,  despite   the                     city  hall's injunction to leave it free.                          Majone  revived  the hardest days of  Avignone.  The  former convent was in                     a sorry state: it was full of dirt and insects.                          The  young  sister  did  not  lose  her  time  in  whining,    but    met  the  situation                     together with the twelve orphans,  worked, cleaned, and transformed what they                     could.                          Bold as the souls full of faith,  she gathered a few masons, white-washers,                     carpenters...  The  place  seemed  a  building  yard...  Thus,    step    by  step,    as  the                     rooms were ready,  the community of Brunaccini moved to the Holy Spirit\" (G.                     Pesci, La luce nasce al tramonto, page 37).                          With regard to insects,  which Rigano overdoes,  we  specify that usually they                     are present with dirt.  When the sisters washed  away   the  dirt,   the  insects                     disappeared.   Therefore,   the overrunning","of insects described by Rigano is overdone by him.                          While  speaking of the difficulties of the  former  convent, the  Father  always                     hinted at the ruined building,  a  victim  of robbery;  as well as at lack of glass, at                     frames of doors, broken or inhexistent windows,  and floor unpaved. If there had                     been  the  plague  of  the  insects,    he  would  have  hinted  at  it  as  he  did  with                     Avignone.  He said that the slums were so full of insects that a few people died                     devoured by them.  Even the older sisters,  while speaking  of the Holy Spirit                     they  never  hinted  at  such  a    plague.  The  Father  fought  several  years  with  the                     insects in Avignone, but when  Briguglio came in,  they had already disappeared.                     Nor  can Rigano  say that the orphaned girls \"were derived from the  dregs of                     society and were really abandoned\" (page 27). That was true at their  coming to                     the institute,  but the orphans who went to  the Holy  Spirit  were living with the                     sisters since  several  years; therefore, they were clean and well under way in                     their life.                          I  suppose  that  Sister  Veronica  narrated  the  story  of Avignone, and her                     sisters of Roccalumera misunderstood. It is the same for the case of the leper.  If                     there was a leper in the Holy Spirit,  the fact wouldn't have slipped out, all the                     more because the disinfection of the building would have been hard.                          Now,  let  us examine the facts which culminated in   Sister Veronica's flight                     to Roccalumera.                                                                                                                686                      10. Don Francis in the institution                              The  sisters' flight to Roccalumera was not the result of  a sudden decision,                     but the epilogue of a plan prepared long since. It is here that Don Francis comes                     on the scene.                          Don    Francis    Di  Francia  (l853-l9l3)  was  a  priest    of    great  virtue,    who                     distinguished himself in the ministry to the sick in the hospital,  in the missions                     to the villages,  and countrysides in  the  diocese  of  Messina.  Felici sees him in                     the hell of Avignone","working  together  with  the  Father  since    the    beginning  (pages  6l-62).                     Historically,  this  is  not  true.  The  redemption  of  Avignone    is    a  work  of  the                     Father only.  In the  beginning,  Don Francis  gave a moral helping hand to him                     now and  then  together with the Priests Ciccolo and Muscolino,  but all of them                     withdrew shortly after. Don Francis committed himself to his favored work, and                     came  back  to  help  the  Father  during  the  l887  cholera,    before  entering    the                     lazzaretto.  Later he went over there from time  to time.  Only  after the death of                     his mother,  on January l888,  he took up his abode in Avignone,  performing,                     however,  his  usual apostolic  ministry.  The statement of Rigano that Canon                     Hannibal  was    helped    by  his  brother  Canon  Francis  \"by  order    of    Cardinal                     Guarino\" is an arbitrary interpretation\" (page 28).                          We also rectify Felici.  He says that Don Francis helped the Father as a loving                     son more than as a brother\" (page 8l).                          Things went in the following way.                          Don  Francis was very affectionate to Hannibal,  but was  of different nature.                     His ideas about government and direction,  for instance, did not match with the                     Father.  He  entered  Avignone  as  a  brother    of  the  Founder  and  second  to  him                     only,   up to a   certain point.  When he disapproved the Father's criteria in  the                     direction of the institute,  he felt drawn to substitute them with his  own criteria.                     He began a deleterious propaganda,  especially in  the ambient  of  the clergy,                     who was openly hostile to the  Father's work.                          Let us listen to the Father on this subject.                                         687                          After  the  schism  was over,  the Father  felt  obliged  to rectify something                     with Father Patane', a good pastor at Gaggi, to reassure  him about the vocations                     he could send to the institute. On May 22, l897, the Father writes:                           \"What happened in my little institution was exquisite  proof from  the  Lord                     for me and its members.  Today that the proof  is almost over, I wouldn't like to                     speak of it, all the more because I did not speak when the proof was on.  I always                     kept in my  mind the  saying of the Holy Spirit \"Your strength will be in  silence                     and hope.\" However, if the past events leave traces harmful to my institution,  I                     sometimes  feel obliged to make  rectifications. This is the case which moves me                     to write.  Therefore,  I keep  to the point.                          A  priest of spotless morality,  very dear to me in  several respects,  formed a                     bad  opinion  about  some  youth  of  my  community,  whom    I    esteemed.    It                     happened  because  of  insinuation    of    other  youth    who    have  been    expelled.                     Hence, several inconveniences followed which I foresaw and tried to avoid by                     keeping silent and by concealing them, but to no","avail.  In fact,  when the  priest very  dear to me realized that he was unable to                     change my way  of seeing  things,  he was moved by excessive zeal.  He sought                     help from   authoritative   priests  of  Messina,   and   later   from ecclesiastical                     authority.                          He had underhand dealings with the authoritative priests for several  years.                     When    someone  wants  his  own  way    of    seeing,    he  speaks  passionately  and                     infuses  his  feelings  in  other  persons.  So  did  that  priest  with  the  authoritative                     brethren. Excited by zeal, they neglected to hear my reasons in order to judge                     more exactly. And  yet,  they  were  learned  and  wise  persons.  I  perceived                     everything,  but  I kept to the saying, \"Your strength will be in silence and hope.\"                     However, today I dare to say something because things are bordering publicity.                          The   ecclesiastical  authority  residing  in  our   beloved cardinal  was almost                     surprised eight months ago not only by  that priest,  but  also by the others in                     whom  that  priest  had    infused  his    excessive    zeal.    Hence,    a  greater                     complication  of  things followed.                          The  echo of these events was not confined in the  institute but  rebounded                     outside.  As it happens  in  similar  cases,  the tongues  get mixed up,  things are                     exaggerated,    the  bad    persons  take  advantage,  the  devil  blows  fire,  and  a                     pandemonium rises.                          Today,  the   ecclesiastical authority  is convinced that  the institute faced a                     trial. Meanwhile, the authoritative persons who shared  in  the excessive zeal of                     that priest  perhaps  have  not changed  opinion,  because  I never had any reason        688                     to  talk  with them.  I was satisfied that the ecclesiastical authority knew the facts.                     Both the cardinal and Msgr.  Basile have talked in a very comfortable manner for                     me.                          Thanks to divine mercy,  my institute has entered a  perfect peace  now.  That                     priest,  who is esteemed by the  ecclesiastical authority,  has  been  told by the                     same authority not  to   concern himself  about   my  institute,  and  has  been                     appointed  to  an honorable office in the chapter of Messina.                          Very Reverend Father,  I don't want to shock you with  these events. It is not                     the first case in the foundation of the orders, rather  is a trial that the Lord permits                     at their beginning.  The trial  has  been  such  that it proves  that  the  merciful                     Lord protected  the existence of the institute against the  snares  of the hellish                     enemy\" (Vol. 37, page 24-25).","11. The hidden party                              The  Father confines himself to referring the action of  Don Francis  near  the                     clergy,  but a man who cares his own  way  of seeing  speaks  passionately and                     infuses  his    feelings    in    other  persons.  Don  Francis  was  not  satisfied  by  his                     propaganda outside, but  began  working  in the community to get on well with  a                     few sisters who shared his ideas.                          The  leader  of these sisters was Sister  Veronica,  and  we understand  the                     reason.  Long  ago,  when Don  Francis  went  to Roccalumera  on  Sundays and                     feasts to say mass  and  preach,  he became the spiritual director of Veronica. She                     wished to become a Theresian  and  was  taking  the necessary  steps  to  reach                     her purpose.   Don   Francis  suggested  that  she  enter   Avignone. Obviously,                     she continued trusting Don Francis, shared his ideas, and  spread  them.  In a                     short time a division  happened  in  the community.  They  acted  in the shade,                     forming a secret  society which  linked  up with Don Francis and  followed  his                     direction. Writes  Father,  \"Some of the sisters' latent discontent with the padre's                     choice for mother superior became obvious to the  padre\" (Ibid. page l30). \"The                     sisters' lack of perfect submission to the founder   created  concealed  opposition\"                     (Ibid.      page      l34).  Therefore,  the  female  community  was  divided  into  two                     parties.                                                                                  689                          Rigano  writes that at the Briguglio's entrance in  Avignone \"there  was little                     order and discipline.\"  The fact is,  disorder and  indiscipline  came  in  when                     Briguglio    began    leading      an  opposition  party  under  the  protection  of  Don                     Francis.                          Felici thinks of \"childish trifles\" (page 86);  and for sure gossip  did not fail in                     such a situation,  which the Father tried to dampen.  For instance, he writes to a                     sister: \"Don Francis did not  send the particular food to...  Not at all.  Perhaps it                     has been  the  sister  superintendent who took  such  a  liberty.  My brother had                     told her to make the same food for all. I say this to make  you  understand how                     imagination  and  temptation    cheat    you\"  (S.C.  Vol.  5,  page  236).  But  not                     everything was trifle.                          Mother M. Carmel D'Amore stood out among the faithful to the Father. Don                     Francis never succeeded to draw her to his own ideas, because  she  never gave                     in,  rather she  told  Don  Francis,  \"I entered  the  institute  to  follow  Padre                     Hannibal,   not  Your Reverence;  therefore,  I  don't want to betray and abandon                     him.\" Don","Francis returned blow for blow:  \"You are like an  egg.  The more  the fire cooks                     it,  the more it bakes hard.\" When I  was  a student, I heard this episode from                     Brother Mariano who endeavored to  know the memories of the institute from the                     Father and  other people.                          If    we   acknowledge   \"persecutions,    calumnies,    and incomprehensions,\"                     as  Rigano writes at page 32,  it  should  be understood that the person persecuted                     is not Sister Veronica, but Sister Carmel.  Things became complicated with time,                     the appeals to  the  archbishops multiplied,  and Cardinal  Guarino   removed                     Sister  Carmel  from the office of superior through  an  official communication to                     the Father on August 3, l896.                          The Father sent her temporarily to Graniti, her native town, to make up;  but                     she was also persecuted over there by  anonymous letters  addressed to her and                     her relatives to impede her  return to Messina.(3)                          How did the Father behave in that instance?  Remembering the nine years that                     Don Francis spent at Avignone, the Father charges himself with weakness. He                     writes on January l0, l907: \"I was very weak  during  those nine years,  seriously                     failing in my duty  of director.  After  three  months,  when I saw  the  first                     strange flashes,  I  had  to  dismiss  you  inexorably.\"  Father  Vitale, however,                     points out rightly:                           The  padre  knew what was happening;  he noticed  a  certain reserve  in  them                     which manifested itself in tasks half  done,  a  lack of conviction,  etc.  He would      690                     have liked to have taken  the matter into his own hands, finding an immediate                     remedy. But if he had done so,  scandal would have broken out,  bringing into                     light  confessors      and      clergy    who    took    offense    at      the      padre's                     uncompromising will.  The ecclesiastical authority would have had the   right  to                     supervise    the    proceedings    of    the    community.  Therefore,    he    suffered                     continually waiting for  Providence  to bring peace (Ibid. page l34).                           When  Sister  D'Amore took leave of absence,  peace did  not come in the                     community.  So,  Cardinal Guarino stroke at the  root prohibiting Don Francis to                     set foot at the Holy Spirit.                          Rigano's  charge  that the Father was unable when he  writes that  the  Father                     was unable \"to refrain  the  malefic  current\" because   \"he  was  recovering  from                     a  nervous  breakdown\"   is irrelevant (page 30).  The Father fell sick in l893, but                     he was","already  in  perfect  working  order  in  the  earthquake  of  l894.    The  facts  we  are                     talking about instead, regard the years l895-l897.                          Things  became  worse.  Don Francis and his initiates  began thinking of a                     flight following the example of Blessed  Eustochio. She   left  her  convent  of                     Basico'  by  night  to  start   the reformation.  This  is perhaps the reason why                     Rigano dates  back the  flight of the sisters reformers to January 22,  feast of the                     Blessed.  We,  however,  know  that the exact date is  March  ll, l897.(4)                        12. The reason for disagreement                              To know exactly the reasons for disagreement between the two brothers, it is                     worthy checking some details.                          The  first  reason  is  the  difference  of  criteria  about spiritual direction.                          Father    Vitale    told  us  that  in  discipline  Don    Francis    was  freer  than  the                     Father,  who was more exact. In the letter we have quoted,  the  Father points out                     a wrong trend which can lead  the souls  to errors.  Don Francis presented the                     things according  to his  point  of view,  but the Father states that  is  \"a  subtle,                     delicate  question merely spiritual.  It is a matter of direction of  souls  for the      691                     formation  of  communities    and    works,    on    the  grounds  of  exact  discipline,                     perfect observance, and practice of interior virtues\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page l9).                          Don  Francis seems to be right by accessory  reasons,  which are external,                     and to which the people usually bear witness.  The first accessory reason is the                     Father's administrative system. Don Francis wanted an administration like that of                     an accountant,  the Father instead lived completely abandoned  in the hands of                     divine providence.  Consequently,  the  Father was always stranded,  and when                     he  was  asked  for  money  he  was  compelled  to  answer    that    he  hadn't  any,                     because he had given it to the poor. Meanwhile debts increased... Don Francis                     along with his youth thought that such a system   had  no  chance  to succeed,                     and sooner  or  later  the institution  would come to an end.  Weren't they  right?                     Humanly  speaking,    yes.    But    they    forgot    who  the  Father    was    and    his                     mission. The people of Messina were right when they defined him as a","man  like  Cottolengo;    and  we  know  very  well  that  Cottolengo  could  not  be                     judged    like  a  common  person.    We  also  acknowledge  that  to  live  with  such                     characters requires uncommon virtue.                          Another  reason  for  disagreement was  lack  of  a  regular novitiate.  At  the                     Holy Spirit there was  a  farrago:  orphans, aspirants, novices, professed. But it                     was the condition of things that  spring  from  nothing and form step by  step.  It                     was  the founder's  duty  to organize it in the proper time and in  proper way.  It is                     well known that at the beginning of the institutions, the  founders care more the                     substance of the novitiate  than  its forms;  these  are  kept within certain limits                     which  allowed  by circumstances.  The  forms of novitiate are perfected with                     time.  For  instance,  The  Little  Sisters  of  the  Poor  were  born  in  l839,  but  they                     began passing through the novitiate in l853 (Trochu, Il primo sia l'ultimo, page                     243).(5)                         13. At Roccalumera                              Let us see the beginning of the institute at Roccalumera.                            692                           Felici  wonders why Don Francis chose Roccalumera  to  begin his  institute,                     and answers:  \"He must have done so for  several reasons.  First,  because  of the                     simple people of the town,  who were  like him,  very simple.  Second,  because                     of  the  pleasant landscape  in  which his religious soul perceived  the  Creator's                     perfections.  Third, because of the poor people among whom he and his sisters                     would  be  at  their  ease  --  poor  among  poor.    Finally,  because  it  was  far  from                     Messina and it would be easier for them to avoid any contrast with his brother                     and his initiatives\" (Il Padre delle orfane, page 99).                           How  true  it is that history and imagination cannot get  on well together!                           The  writer says that Don Francis and his sisters planned  a new  house  with a                     regular novitiate always  under  the  Father's government.  They had no intention                     of  creating  a  new  institution  or  congregation,  but  a  novitiate  with  members                     formed by a new","direction,  who  would  return  to the Holy Spirit  to  make  the  institute flower                     again.                          But,  this  plan  was  unfitting.  If  the  Father's  generosity  was  the    cause    of                     extreme poverty,  a new house under his  direction wouldn't solve difficulties,  it                     would  rather  make  them  worse    by  increasing  debts.    Don  Francis  did  not                     consider  that  the  charisma  for    specific    institutions    is  given  by  God  to    the                     persons  he chooses,  and   God  had chosen the Father for the  Daughters  of                     Divine Zeal.                          Thus,  Don Francis and Sister Veronica had formed their plan of reformation,                     but they had established no time, no place.                          Out    of    the  blue,    one  evening  Sister  Veronica  went  to    Don  Francis                     announcing    to    him  that  she  had  decided  to    go    to    her  native  place,                     Roccalumera,  to lodge in the house of Marchioness Fiorentino.                          Left the house in the night(6) together with Sister Rose and the two sisters                     Marino  (one  of  them  was  a  novice  and  the  other  an  aspirant),  they  reached                     Roccalumera in the morning.                          From there, they wrote to the Father. He went to Roccalumera two  days later                     to pick them up,  showing them a letter from  the vicar  general  who had ordered                     their    return    to    Messina.    Only  Sister    Veronica  remained  at  Roccalumera,                     because she was  sick. Meanwhile,  she  tried to convince the Father to accept the                     plan agreed  upon  with Don Francis.  The other ones who  returned  to Messina                     did not resign themselves to do without Roccalumera,  so the  Father dismissed            693                     them  and  told  Sister  Veronica  to    give    her  garb  back.  A  few  months  later                     Cardinal Guarino died. Don Francis, acting  in  agreement with  Msgr.  D'Arrigo,                     re-established  the community and took over the direction in Roccalumera.                          I  deem  necessary to correct Rigano,  who assures that  Don Francis started                     his institution because he was \"encouraged by the vicar  general,  and therefore                     he decided to start  his  activity with   the   group   of  the  sisters  who  suffered                     so      great  incomprehension\"  (page  3l).    If  the  foundation  of  Don Francis  was                     legitimate,  why to start it in secret?   If the vicar general had authorized him,                     why the same vicar imposed the sisters to return to  Messina?  If  Don  Francis                     had discovered  his  own  way  at Roccalumera,  why did he insist so much to                     return to Avignone and to form again the community he had divided?(7)                          Almost  shortly  after the  separation,  Don  Francis  began proposing  to bring                     together the two communities.  He insisted in saying to the Father, \"Let us make                     a merger, making peace!\"                          The Father argued, \"Between the peace regarding us brothers and the merger                     of the institutions there is a great difference.","They are two things absolutely distinct and separate.  People  of common  sense                     understands it.  As to the personal peace,  I  have always   brought  peace  to                     you.\"  As  to  the  merger  of   the institutions,  the matter is different,  and the                     Father is averse to  it  because  he sees no improvement in  his  brother's  ideas                     (Jan.  l0, l907).  But he wishes good to his institution. \"I wish you  to  go  ahead.                     May the Lord bless and  make  the  house  of Roccalumera  prosperous,  giving                     you the consolation of seeing it growing  up in virtue and in providence,   as well                     as a means for the  salvation  of souls.  The God who draws good from  evil  and                     retorts  the hellish snares against the author of them, Satan, be glorified in this                     institution\" (Ibid.  page 20).  Then he reminds his  brother  of  the disposition  of                     Archbishop  D'Arrigo,  who \"decided  that the brothers be in perfect  relation,                     peace,  and union,  but each of them be in his own institution\"  (Ibid.  page l9).                          Don  Francis made the last attempt to merge the institutions at the end of l909,                     when  he  was  willing  to  accept  the  conditions  the  Father  had  made.  But  Don                     Orione, the vicar general of Messina at that time, opposed it. The Father writes to                     Father Palma, \"Don Orione was averse to it:  he wants those sisters to have a                     humble  and    complete  submission  to  us.    Me,    Canon    Vitale,    and    Father                     Bonarrigo agree upon it\" (S.C.  Vol.  7,  page 45). Father Vitale confirms,                           \"I  witnessed to the conversation of the Servant of God  and Don Orione about                     this matter.  Don Orione was decidedly averse to it, because the merger of the                     institutions  in  the  spirit  of  Canon  Hannibal      Di      Francia      seemed    to    him     694                     morally      impossible.  Nevertheless,    the    Servant    of  God  was  morally    and                     financially generous with them.\"(8)                                Don  Francis  went  ahead  with  his  own  institution.  At  his  death,    the                     Capuchins  took  over  the  direction,    giving  them    the  constitutions    and      the                     name:    \"Capuchin  Sisters  of    the    Sacred  Heart.\"  It  is  a  beautiful,  promising                     religious congregation.","14. After the separation                              The  division  of  the institutions did not affect  the  two brothers' relationship.                     Sister Veronica declares,                           \"Apart    from  our  departure  which  caused  a    deep    wound,    the  brothers                     remained cordially united.  As soon as Hannibal knew of his  brother's sickness,                     he  immediately  went  to  Roccalumera    and  stayed    over  there  as  in  his  own                     house,  smiling,  amiable,  and happy.\"                           On  the  other  hand,  Don  Francis  went  to  Avignone.  A  Religious  of  ours                     reports:  \"When I was very young, I saw several times Don Francis  coming  at                     Avignone in the evening  to  talk  with  the Servant  of God.   I naively asked the                     Father,  'Why doesn't your brother  work with you?' Smiling and calm,  he told                     me,  'My son, the  Lord lets each one follow his own way'.\"   He wrote  to  Don                     Francis,  \"I  always loved you sincerely,  wishing that the  Lord free  you from                     any evil and overwhelm you with good\" (January l0, l907).  After the death of his                     brother,  the Father wrote to Msgr. D'Arrigo,  \"I loved  my brother Francis with a                     very tender  love, as a father more than as a brother! (Vol.  29,  page 30). He                     sang his praise on God and Neighbor (S.C. Vol. l, page l49).                              695                          However, because Don Francis encouraged the secession of the sisters with                     subterfuges,  simulation,  and intrigues, the Father was  grieved.  He  thought                     that  all  this  couldn't    come    without  prejudice  to  his  brother's  spirit.    For  this                     reason he  sometimes used strong words, charging him with taking \"a false way                     very far from  the virtue and perfection,  and with rejecting the study of one's                     own sanctification\" (January l0,  l907).  He also wrote  to Melanie,  \"Pray for my                     poor and dear brother that he be converted to God strongly and mildly,  but more                     mildly than strongly\" (S.C. Vol.  8,  page 2).  Writing to Don Francis he says, \"I                     will never stop  praying to the Lord,  I will even offer my useless life for your                     sincere  return  to  God,  for  your  sanctification,   and salvation.\"  God  did not                     accept the sacrifice  of  the  Father's life,  but heard his prayer.  In fact, soon after                     the news of his brother's death, he wrote to Father Vitale, \"Since a few years my                     brother  had  become  holy,    humble,  recollected,  prudent,  detached,  and  pious\"                     (Vol. 3l, page 29).                          The    Father    always    had    a  special    consideration    for    his  brother's                     institution,  because,   says  Sister  Veronica,   \"he admired  our","community,  and his great heart reserved  the  best gifts for us...  After the death                     of his brother,  the Servant  of God did not stop helping us sending flour now and                     then,    and  once  a  thousand  liras.\"  Sister  Veronica  was  so  happy  when  she                     received  a    beautiful    statue    of    the  Immaculate  from    Hannibal    Mary    Di                     Francia,  the day after the death of the founder Don Francis.  He addressed the                     gift to his brother and to the unforgettable Daughters of Roccalumera\" (Rigano,                     Sorriso... page 85).                          At  the  funeral  of  the Servant of  God,  the  sisters  of Roccalumera wished                     to  follow  immediately  after  our  congregations,  because    they  considered                     themselves daughters of the  Servant  of God.                          Remembering  the  persons  who  rushed to the  tomb  of  the Father,  Sister                     Veronica says, \"I too knelt before him, but I did not pray for his soul,  because I                     think he is already in  heaven. Besides,  in  our  communities  we  use  to  appeal                     to  him  for protection, whereas  we also say some requiems for his brother.\"                        15. Suppression of the sisters                             The l897 is a crucial year in the Father's life.                                     696                          The  flight of the FOUR sisters to Roccalumera had been  the talk  of  the city;                     but when the sensation had cooled  down,  an unfortunate event created a new                     ado calling the attention of  the public to the Holy Spirit's institute.                          An    orphaned  girl  had  escaped  the  institute  to  go  back  home.  The    sisters                     searched for her all day long in  vain,  then,  they informed  the  police who in                     turn  addressed  the  ecclesiastical authority.  It  is a fact so simple and common                     for any institute! Are the institutes condemned to death for  so little?  But  owing                     to  the  red-hot ambient created in Messina against the  Father's female  institute                     (and we know how it was  created),  the  vicar general  Msgr.  Basile  suggested                     the cardinal  to   suppress  the institute  and  to  put an end to it.  He did  so                     because he was governing","the diocese in the absence of Cardinal Guarino who  was sick.  Also the Father                     was absent from Messina.  Therefore, Msgr. Basile  sent  for Father Bonarrigo,                     and told him to  inform  the Father  about the order of the cardinal.  Father Vitale                     says that the  vicar general issued an ordinance stating that  the  sisters leave  and                     go back their homes (page l37).  Such an ordinance  is unknown.  In fact, the                     Father  writes  that  the  cardinal  \"dissolved  the    institute  of  the  sisters,    without                     issuing a written decree\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page l65).                          Where was the Father?  In those years he was searching for a person  who                     could  direct  the  female  community,  because  his dealings  with the Daughters                     of Charity,  the Daughters of  Saint Anna,  and the Sisters of Good Shepherd had                     come to nothing.  Now he  was thinking of Melanie  of La Salette,  who was at                     Galatina (Lecce).  He  had gone over there to pay a visit to her,  in  the hope  that                     she  would take over the direction  of  the  sisters. Writes  the Father,  \"I invited                     her to Messina,  but she did  not decide  whether she would come or not.  She                     spoke  about  Messina fondly,  even  showed a copy of the letter of the Virgin                     Mary  to the  people of Messina (the copy she had was written in  French). But                     still she did not come to a decision\" (Vol. 45, page 79).                     Then   the  Father  handed  her  a  letter  asking  for  prayers, especially \"to obtain                     a good, holy, humble, expert, smart, fit                     directress\" (S.C. Vol. 8, page 2).                          Returned to Messina, the Father found that his institute was on the verge of                     death. In spite of the understandable breaking of his heart, he took courage, told        697                     the communities to pray, and                     went to Msgr. Basile.                           \"He    showed    that  he  was  ready  to  comply  with  the    ordinance  with  great                     submission,    but  he  had  one  question:    what  would  they  do  with  the  seventy                     orphans?   Msgr. Basile was perplexed at this unexpected question;  he said that                     he  was  compelled  to  issue    the  ordinance    by    the    dissidents  inside  the                     community  and  by  the appeals to the Chancery Office.  However,  he would                     grant a delay to  find  a person to whom the padre could entrust  the  orphans.                     Shortly  after    that,    the    sisters    would    leave\"    (Father    Mary  Hannibal  Di                     Francia, page l37).                           It  comes  natural to ask ourselves whether Don Francis  had something  to  do                     with this matter.  Here it is what  the  Father quickly wrote to Melanie,  \"Back to                     Messina, I have found a worse persecution:  my  poor and dear brother entered                     the spirit of  an ecclesiastical  superior,  who  has  already  obtained  from  the                     cardinal  the  order to suppress my little  religious  community. They will fix a                     date to make the sisters put off the garb and leave.                     It is a true oppression of the innocent...  In  such  a situation we have no means,                     but prayer! And we have begun praying so much. Please deign to join us. We are                     in a critical situation. Our matter is the talk of the city,  and the authorities want","to put  an  end to it by suppressing my community.  We could find  a remedy  in                     a mature person expert in educating  the  youths  and willing  to  take  over  the                     direction,  in  the  hope  that  the ecclesiastical  authorities  come to terms.\" Then                     he    concludes,  \"Couldn't    you  come  and  help  my  community,    at  least                     temporarily? If Our Lady doesn't let you do so,  at least pray to her to  send the                     elect  person\" (S.C.  Vol.  8,  page 3).  Melanie  \"answered immediately in the                     affirmative\" (Vol. 45, page 79).                          However, the order to dismiss the sisters was still holding. Should he dismiss                     them after Melanie had come in?  Providence had opened the way to fulfill its                     designs.                          Father  Bernard  of Messina was a zealous Minor  Friar,  the confessor of the                     Father,  and very near to Cardinal  Guarino.  He took  a spontaneous interest in                     the matter.  For health  reasons, the  cardinal  was  staying at Marullo,  a great                     villa  near  the convent  of Saint Mary of the Angels founded by  Father  Bernard.                     Profiting  by his reputation,  Father Bernard asked for a private audience  with                     the  cardinal.   With  great  humility  and  fine strategy,  he reminded the cardinal                     of the fruitless fig that the owner  condemned  to  death;  later,  however,  he                     deferred    the  execution    of    the   sentence  for  another    year    at    the    farmer's                     request.  Given  the Little Shepherd of Salette's  presence,  new fruit could be                     expected from the religious community.                          The    cardinal  smiled  and  agreed  with  Father  Bernard,    hoping  for  a  better                     future with the friar's words.                                                            698                          With the utmost haste Father Bernard rushed to the padre and crying  with                     joy  said:  'Victory! Victory!  Victory!'  Then  he related  the  delay  the cardinal                     granted in  order  to  set  the community  back  on  its feet.  The Lord's mercy                     along  with  the protection of Our Lady triumphed!                          We  don't relate Melanie's work.  The year Melanie spent  in the  community                     was \"a year of blessing.  Under  her  guide,  the institute  revived,  and when the                     Lord called her somewhere else, the foundation of the female community was                     well laid down\"  (Vol. 22, page l3l).                          The Father's biography informs us about that.","16. He surrendered to the Lord's will                              It is a matter of great interest to know how the Father behaved during the l897                     serious trials.                          He was intimately united to the Lord's will.  When the trial was more urgent,                     he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,  \"Thy will be done! Let us pray and trust                     in God... It is a test for us and the institute...  If the institution belongs to God,  he                     will save  it...  God  uses so various means to purify  the  souls!... Lord, thy will                     be done!...\"                          The    elderly    sisters    unanimously    swear    that    the    Father  endured    the                     secession peacefully.  He forbade the congregants to speak of these events.(9)                          He endeavored to show nothing of his intimate martyrdom  and behaved with                     everyone calmly, and sometimes smilingly.                          Father D'Agostino reports that he once happened to be in the sacristy of the                     Holy Spirit that year, and the Father told him,                          - I trust there.                          - Father, what does it mean?                          - The host, my son.                          The  host  gave  him  the  strength  to  embrace  the  cross lovingly.                          The  Father's  fortitude shone when he formed the  spiritual union  among the        699                     institute's  energetic  and  affectionate    members.  Such  a  union  was  formed  in                     September l898,  after the l897 trial, when  Melanie  was leaving.  The members                     pledged  to  persevere, difficulties  and tribulation notwithstanding,  \"except the                     case that  the  Lord  manifests  clearly  through  the  ecclesiastical superiors  that                     he does not want the institution any longer\" (Cf. ch. 6, no. 9, b).                       17. Among the Sisters of the Sacred Side                             We  have  written  a  specific  monograph  on  the  Father's suffering  for the                     Sisters of the Sacred Side.  Here,  we  report some of those sisters' thoughts.                          The dissension between the Father and the bishop of Potenza was caused by                     the Father's decision to dismiss a sister","who  had  no  vocation,    but  was  protected  by  the  bishop.    She,  however,  had                     deceived the bishop.                          \"The  Father faced several difficulties in treating  matters of  souls.  One of                     the  greatest  troubles  was  the  direction  of  our  institute.    When    he  decided  to                     remove  a  sister  from    Potenza    in  agreement    with  the  bishop,    he  faced  the                     opposition of the  same bishop  who  had  changed  his  mind.  He  issued  an                     interdict, prohibiting the Father to set foot in Potenza. Despite the Father obeyed                     quickly  and  exactly  the  bishop's  ordinance,    the  disorders  continued.      The                     Servant of God, however,  fostered the  peace in the  spirits by trusting in the                     Lord only,  in the hope that  the truth  would  triumph.\"  \"I  see the Father's                     fortitude  in  the misunderstanding  with the bishop,  as well as  in all his  life,                     which    was  burdened  with  physical  and  moral  sacrifices.\"  \"He    had  to    face                     various    difficulties    in  the    foundation    and    in    the  government    of  the                     communities;  but he was strong and  submitted himself to God's will.  When I                     was the superior of the sister who caused  the fight between the Father and the                     bishop,  as well  as the  fatal  scission that is lasting among the Daughters  of  the                     Sacred  Side,  the  Father  was outspoken  and  constant  in  his thought.    But  he                     was  very obedient to the ordinance  of  the bishop  prohibiting  him to set foot in                     Potenza.\"    \"Founding    and  governing    an  order  and  its  communities  implies                     plenty  of  grave obstacles because of permissions,  money,  means,  and variety                     of characters  not  always perfectly formed.  And yet,  he  overcame everything                     without  losing heart.  The event  of  Potenza  which happened when I was the             700                     superior of the dismissed sister,  proves it clearly.\"                       18. Gleaning                             At  the  end  of  this  chapter  we  report  additional  evidences  of  the  Father's                     fortitude and serenity while suffering impediments.                          \"I  never saw the Father upset because of physical and moral disease.\" \"I saw                     the Father sick more than once.  He","worried  for  the  work  in  arrears,  but  he  submitted  himself  to  God's  will.\"    \"I                     remember  him  sick  with catarrh  at  Ritiro,  where  Archbishop D'Arrigo visited                     him and said,  'Cheer up, endure this suspension a  divinis'  (he  was  hinting at                     the    impossibility    of    saying  mass)...  He  suffered  pains  and  privations  with                     heroic fortitude.\" \"He underwent with patience various and long diseases of body                     and spirit.  I  never heard him complaining.  His last disease was  a lesson for                     us.\"  \"He suffered serious physical pains,  especially the nervous-breakdown in                     his mature age. His last disease was the apex. He often said to an assistant,  'Let                     us pray a little while to the Lord to grant me twenty minutes of rest this night'.\"                     \"He underwent  a hernia surgery unafraid and the extraction of  water from his                     pulmonary pleura without hesitating.  His only worry was about  the  expenses                     we somehow concealed.  He also suffered  the last disease valiantly, even though                     he wished to recover to serve the  institute.\" But the topic of his last disease is                     treated    in  the  biography,  therefore  we  'll  talk  of  the  spirit    with  which  he                     embraced the crosses.                          \"He  seemed as though the painful events didn't regard him.\" \"When  he was                     opposed,  a little smile on his lips revealed  that his  spirit rested in the bosom of                     God.\"    \"I  never  saw  him    upset  when  he  was  facing  men  and  events.    How                     impertubable  he  was    when  fire    destroyed  our  wooden  church.\"    When  the                     government made the requisition of our house in Altamura during the war,  the                     Servant  of  God  wrote  to  Father  Vitale,    \"We  have  cups  of  contradiction  in                     Altamura! The building has been taken over by the soldiers!  Long live Jesus and          701                     Mary!\" (Vol.  3l, page 9l). As to Saint Paschal's, \"I  am going to Oria because of                     an eviction order.  They want  to make it a lazzaretto.  Praised be the Lord! He                     knows what is good for us.  Everything works out for good!\" (Vol.  3l,  page 7).                     On another  occasion,  \"Our loving Lord is visiting us with his holy cross. Let us                     embrace  it  as  our  support  and  fortitude!\"  (Vol.  32,  page    33).      \"Cheer!    The                     cross  is  salvation,   strength,  and everything!\" (Vol. 34, page 98). \"The cross is                     as sweet as honey. Happy are those who taste it!\" (S.C.  Vol. 5, page ll3). \"My                     dear son,  I understand your spiritual and bodily pains, but isn't the cross   the                     treasure  of  the  elect?   The  cross   sanctifies, strengthens, comforts, and saves!\"                     (Vol. 30, page l02). \"The Lord has visited your community with his holy cross.                     The cross is love and salvation!\" (Vol. 42, page l23).                          During the disturbances of the after war,  he writes,  \"Time urges! Let us draw                     close to our Lord!\" (S.C.  Vol. 33, page l33). \"The strikes because of the high                     cost of living are an excuse to overthrown the government  morally  dead, take                     over the nation,","and persecute  the  Church!  We must draw  close  to  Jesus,  supreme goodness,                     and shelter in the safe refuge of the most holy  Heart of  Jesus  and  Mary.  She is                     the propitious door of  the  divine Heart,  and Saint Joseph is the celestial house-                     steward.\"  (These were the titles of July first that year). (Vol. 35, page 2l7).                          We  end  this  chapter with two evidences of  deep  meaning. \"Despite these                     sorrows,    the  Father  always  kept  calm,    and  happy.  One    day  he  was  sitting                     thoughtful,  sad,  hanging head  down.  I asked  him,  'What's the matter?  How                     do you feel?'   'Not  well, daughter. Today the Lord forgot me, because he visited                     me with no opposition.'   Another day,  he was very happy,  and when I asked the                     reason he responded,  'Today the Lord gave me many gifts.  He remembered  me,                     and  sent  so many  oppositions.'   In  all  the emergencies I witnessed to,  the                     Servant of God was happier,  and we  used  to say,  'Who knows what sorrows                     the  Father  underwent today'!\" (l25, l5).                        Notes                              (l)   When I was sending this work to the press,  I received the  book L'ideale non muore,  which is a                     remaking of  Sorriso  e luce,  i.  e.,  a  more  extensive biography of Mother  Veronica. Rigano  proves                     the  uncommon virtues  of  the  venerable  sister through documents from the archive, while the people   702                     wait for the judgment of the Church.  We join them. However, we point out that Rigano is substantially                     maintaining the same ideas he has written in  Sorriso e luce about the dwelling of Sister Veronica  at  the                     Holy Spirit and her secession.  He complains that \"we have almost given  a romantic story to the origin of                     Roccalumera  institute.\" If there is any novel, it is easy to check where it comes from.                          We    follow  the  Father's  writings  together    with    Papasogli-Taddei,    specifically    the  letter  to  his                     brother on  January  l0, l907.  This  letter is decisive to interpret well the facts which caused the schism of                     Roccalumera,    and  the  results  are    different  from  Rigano's.    He  is  aware  of  it,  and  tries  to  solve  the                     problem by getting rid of that letter by saying that it  was  written by the \"disciples of Don Hannibal\"                     (L'ideale, page 55). Well, well, it  is  too easy avoiding the value of a troubling  document   by simply                     denying its authenticity!...                          Our quotations are from Sorriso e luce; when we  refer  to Ideale, we'll specify it.","(2)    The  first  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  are  Giuffrida  Mary,  Affronte  Mary,  Santamaria  Josephine,                     D'Amico Rosa. They took the garb on March l8, l887.                           (3)   The  anonymous  letters  aiming  at  avoiding   Sister D'Amore's  return  to  the  institute,  prove                     that   she    was   not dismissed,  contrary to Rigano's  assertion. Rigano adds that  she  \"returned to the                     Daughters of Divine Zeal's institute, also through the good offices of Canon Hannibal\" (L'ideale,  page                     46). I  repeat,  Sister D'Amore was never dismissed,  but was sent  to Graniti to recover.  It is obvious that                     the Father encouraged her during the persecution, and when he called her back to Messina on May  l2,                     l897,  he wrote,  \"If the ecclesiastical authority  had dismissed you from the institute,  I should have been                     told not to call you back. Thanks to God, it never happened. On the contrary, you can say to the people                     who doubt the truth of this story, that this  morning I had an audience with the cardinal,   talked about                     your return to the institute,  and the cardinal agreed upon  your return.  You  will be appointed to the                     office that obedience will give you\" (Vol. 34, l0).                           (4) Also the compilers of Il ramo fiorito,   report the date of March ll, but they mistake the year.  It                     was l897,  not  l895 (page  25).  Il ramo fiorito is a special issue that the Tertiary Capuchin  Sisters of the                     Sacred Heart published on  the  fiftieth anniversary of their founder (l963).                           (5)  Did  the institute of Roccalumera begin with a  regular novitiate?  Sister Veronica appears so                     solicitous, but there is a many  slip twixt the cup and the lip...  We know that up  to  the death  of Don                     Francis (l9l3),  the novitiate was not settled yet. In fact,  it was Father Salvatore of Valledolmo of the                     Capuchins that  settled  it.  Can we marvel at that?  We must consider  the beginning of the institutions                     benignly,  just as Rigano does  for Roccalumera.  \"Because it was a little community, sisters and novices                     lived together in the fervor of a continuous novitiate\" (L'ideale, page ll9).                           (6) Saying that Sister Veronica left the institute by  night does not sound well to her, therefore she                     wants the people to say that she left in the morning. The fact is that they left on March ll,  at three a.m.,                     when it is still night.  Rigano asserts that they  went out from the house,  not from the church.  \"It is true   703                     that  the evening before Sister Veronica asked the  sacristan  to open  the  door  of  the church early in  the                     morning,  but  the precaution  resulted useless by the presence of the door  keeper\" (L'ideale,  page  50).                     The presence of the door keeper  at  that hour,  however,  cannot  be explained without an  agreement.                     But these are trifles.                           (7)  Says  Rigano,  \"It was January 22,  l897,  when  Sister Veronica  of  the child Jesus became the                     co-founder of  the  new religious  family,   after  receiving  the  permission  from  the Ordinary  of                     Messina\" (page 34).  Besides  the  wrong  date,  no permission from the Ordinary of Messina results.                           (8)  It  is  unfounded the Rigano's thought  that  when  the Father  went  to Roccalumera he made some                     attempts to  have  back Sister  Veronica  as  the superior of his institute  in  Messina\" (L'ideale,  page  56).                     Since  Mother Mary Nazzarena  Majone  was appointed as head of the institute,  after the l897  events,                     the  Father  never  sought  to  replace  her,  because  she  was  docile  to  his  directives  and  very  faithful  in                     everything.","This  is  also  true  for  Miss  Palermo,  before  she  joined  Canon  Celona  as  a  co-founder  of  the  \"Ancelle                     Riparatrici.\"  Until she lived in Catania, she had good relations with the Father and sent some   vocations                     to him.  But the Father never sought her as  the  head of his institute \"to give peace to it\" (Ibid. page                     l550).  On  the  contrary,  I  have  heard  Father  Vitale  reporting  the  Servant  of  God's  opinion  on  Miss                     Palermo, before she joined Canon Celona. He said, \"She is not a vocation for us.\"                           (9)  To  make the painful event of the secession  fall  into oblivion,  the  Father never gave the name of                     Veronica to any  of the 300 sisters who took the garb.                                                                                                                                     704","22.

It controls our inclination to                     the  sensible  pleasures,  confining  them  within  the  limits  of  reason  and  faith.                     Temperance is the last of the cardinal virtues because it regulates the individual's                     acts not related to our neighbor. But it is one of the most important virtues for the                     individual because it bridles the strongest instincts of human nature and directs                     man to God, preventing him from loving himself disorderly.                          Temperance  reminds  us  of  the  wide  meaning  of  mortification,  which  is                     indispensable to achieve perfection in our state of fallen nature. With regard to                     this subject, let us quote a Father's talk with Father Vitale.                           \"One  day  walking  in  the  garden  of  the  Holy  Spirit,  our  founder  asked  me                     which  virtue  the  fundamental  one  was.  I  answered:  'Holy  humility.'  He  said:                     'That one comes from the main virtue that is the source of all virtue. I think that                     mortification  is  the  foundation  of  perfection.  And  I  mean  mortification  in                     everything:  intellect,  will,  feelings,  etc.  But  given  our  overbearing  tendencies                     towards passion, how can we control ourselves completely'?\" (Ibid. page 3l2).                                                                                                               706                          This is hard to understand today. Paul VI points out opportunely, \"If we really                     want  to  imitate  Christ,  we  must  accept  his  words  as  a  binding  program.  His                     words are, 'Whoever wishes to be my follower must deny his very self, take up                     his cross each day, and follow in my steps'\" (Lk. 9, 23). The Pope continues, \"Do                     we want an easy or a strong Christianity? The temptation of an easy Christianity                     enters  everywhere  today.  It  even  reaches  the  Religious  who  are  committed  to                     austerity  by  making  them  break  not  only  discipline  such  as  the  garb,  the                     schedule,  etc.,  but  also  the  roots  of  Christianity,  such  as  faith...  How  many                     teachers  who  follow  more  the  world  than  the  gospel  dare  to  break  the                     fundamental truths which are beyond our understanding? The school and modern                     pedagogy try to present an easy Christianity","by stripping it of its commandments,  because they disturb people in theory and                     practice.  These  teachers  intend  to  eliminate  any  obstacle  to  help  people  live                     spontaneously  and  autonomously  in  the  fulness  of  life.  They  commit  a  great                     psychological mistake when they present an easy, comfortable Christianity to the                     youths, avoiding rules, weights, but sticking at nothing\" (Osservatore Romano,                     February  l8,  l972).  These  are  old  errors  covered  with  modern  fashion.  For                     instance, Innocent XI condemned the following sentence, \"The voluntary cross of                     mortification  is  an  oppressing,  useless  burden,  which  we  must  get  rid  of\"                     (Denzinger,  Enchiridion  Symbolorum,  no.  l258).  Paul  VI  instead  calls  our                     attention to this gospel, \"May no one deceive himself, Christ is demanding. The                     way of Christ is the narrow one\" (March 4, l970).                       2. The Father's teaching                              Besides referring to the Rogationist Anthology for the Father's writing about                     mortification,  we quote the following page.                          The Father holds mortification as a subsidiary subject of prayer.                           Prayer and mortification are two wings of the soul flying to God. Practicing         707                     mortification is perhaps more important than praying, because the more a person                     is mortified, the more he is fitting for prayer. The more a person prays, the more                     he  feels  the  need  to  mortify  himself.  So,  prayer  and  mortification  increase                     mutually and lead the person from strength to strength (Ps. 84, 8). What does it                     mean mortification? It means to sentence our passions and senses to death.  It is                     carried out in the following way:                          First, we must mortify our opinions and will. Being detached from our will                     and opinion, even in the slightest things, renders the soul docile and submissive                     to the divine will. God can dispose of such souls as he wants.                          Second,  we  must  regulate  our  natural  affections,  such  as  those  toward  our                     relatives and friends, directing them to the pure love of God.                          Third, we must mortify our inclinations, desires, attachments, etc.                          Above all, we must mortify selfishness, which is the great enemy of the love                     of God and of our perfection. Selfishness drives us to abhorr the cross, to please                     ourselves even in the holy things, to long for our own","esteem and praise, to fear being forgotten and despised. Selfishness is so subtle                     and malicious as to deceive us inadvertently under the appearances of good. It                     makes us feel innocent, when we are guilty; it rises human respect, envy, anger,                     contempt of our neighbor, egotism, and plenty of faults. Selfishness is pride, the                     root of all sins, just as Scripture says.                          If the congregants of this least order neglect to battle and mortify selfishness                     through actions, prayer to God and the most holy Virgin; as well as through the                     means of discipline and observance at their disposal, they will never be able to                     meet the holy aims of their institute.                          Finally,  the  mortification  of  the  senses  is  very  important  and  efficacious.                     Without it we are unable to advance toward perfection, rather we are in danger of                     being lost. Saint John of the Cross calls this mortification \"obscure night.\" The                     soul comes to the light of divine union through it.                          We must mortify the sense of hearing by not listening to useless talk, vain                     novels  and  tales,  and  conversations  nurturing  curiosity;  we  must  mortify  taste                     and gluttony by perfectly fasting according to the rules of the holy Church and                     our  order,  and  by  eating  moderately  and  without  complaint,  either  we  like  or                     dislike the food. The Blessed Colombiere, the apostle of the Heart of Jesus, made                     a fine mortification by not consenting to the taste of the food.                          Also  drinks  are  subject  to  rules.  The  masters  of  the  spirit  hold  that                     mortification of taste and gluttony is the first step in the spiritual life. For this                     reason the congregants will give up sweets, save when these are served by the             708                     community, a few times a year.                          We must usually mortify the sense of sight,  especially in the church or when                     we  pray;  we  must  mortify  the  sense  of  smell  by  accepting  jobs  implying                     unpleasant  odor, and  by  never smelling flowers or perfumes for fun; we must                     mortify  the  sense  of  touch  by  patiently  suffering  any  molestation,  such  hot                     weather, cold, rain, labor, hard bed, pains, and diseases\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page l86).                        3. The practice                              Let us see the Father's spirit of mortification.                          Writes Father Vitale,                           Very  brisk  and  inclined  to  energetic  creativity  by  nature,  he  endeavored  to                     restrain himself in opposition; in his notes he asked the","Lord \"for silent patience, silence, calm, mortification of impulse, of anxiety, of                     solicitude, etc.\"                          He handled mortification of his own will the way he did for taste and sleep.                     He submitted to ecclesiastical superiors and counselors. Once, seeing behaving                     quite the opposite of his way of thinking, I expressed my surprise. He answered:                     \"My behavior has been suggested by that superior whom I sought  for advice.\"                     Then he quoted the scripture: 'Do everything under advice and you will not regret                     anything.' As a youth, I was hesitant to submit my will to some superior for fear                     of making  mistakes of conscience, but the padre said: 'Get used to submitting                     ordinary events that do not affect your conscience; mortified in this way, you will                     be ready to deal with harder things.' Due to this inner mortification, he remained                     silent in the troubles  he faced for the foundation. Never did he say a word of                     contempt  or  of  reproach  against  those  who  tried  to  make  an  attempt  on  the                     foundation's existence in either good or bad faith. Once, he said: \"I feel sorry for                     the adversaries because they can hurt their souls.\"                          When  he  was  lacking  temporal  and  spiritual  goods  for  the  community,  he                     worried inside but conformed to God's will perfectly because he knew that He                     would lend help. The padre behaved the same in good and bad times.                          He never went for a walk or treated himself to recreation, rest, or vacations:                     when he got back home tired and out of breath, he began preaching or doing a                     religious service; when he stepped down from the pulpit, he said the breviary,                     exclaiming: \"How much time costs!\" Our Father knew how valuable time was.                 709                     He made his institutions so productive by utilizing time (Ibid. page 3l5).                           We still quote Father Vitale.                           He  never  stopped  mortifying  himself.    In  his  youth,  he  got  used  to  severe                     fasting, which affected his health. He could not conceal it. One day while I was a                     cleric,  I  had  a  stomach-ache;  the  padre,  in  his  simplicity,  said:  \"You  have                     abstained and fasted for a long time, as I used to. - Youthful insanity - as Saint                     Bernard called it. I was truly crazy!\" Given assurance that I did not know such                     things, he repeated: \"Falling sick, striken by disease... these are the expressions                     that we read about almost all saints, who suffered as they worked; therefore, we                     must go on suffering and working. Our Lord Jesus Christ never ceased suffering                     inside.\" Because of his ecclesiastical status and because he was under the guide                     of excellent spiritual directors, he was forced to restrain from fasting (Ibid. page                     3l2).                           The apostolate among the poor engaged him to a life of severe mortification.                          Reports a witness, \"Not only the Father was temperate, but also mortified. It                     was well known to the citizens that he often","took a spoonful from the poor's bowls to make his dish, and more than once he                     ate from their bowls.\" A niece of the Father testifies, \"In the early times of his                     apostolate  in  Avignone,  my  grandmother  made  the  woollen  matress  for  him  a                     few times again, because he gave it up to the poor and slept on the straw.\"                          Usually,  before  doing  anything  the  Father  prayed,  and  so  did  he  for                     mortification. He wrote a letter to the most holy Virgin to get it.                           Queen of all saints, my mother Immaculate Mary, in a special way you are the                     mother of the priests.  I introduce  myself to you: at  your feet there is a pitiful                     priest,  humbly  asking  for  your  protection,  divine  enlightenment,  and  motherly                     counsel. Seat of wisdom, enlighten, teach, and counsel me.                          First, I submit my doubts about the mortification of the taste. You know how                     much I have failed, and I am still failing!... You know how much these failures                     can hurt the Institution of the Poor of the Sacred Heart of Jesus!                          Second, I submit my doubts about health, because of fasting. You know very                     well that I am unworthy feeding  my sinful body; that I have hurt my spiritual                     well-being and perhaps my bodily health, because of intemperance!                          Third,  I  submit  my  doubts  and  wishes  about  penance.  Guilty  of  thousand                     faults, I should do hard penance, still, I do not do it.                          Most  holy  mother,  divine  teacher  of  all  the  virtues,  I  beg  you  to  make  me                     walk  the  way  of  my  sanctification,  the  sanctification  of  souls,  and  the        710                     development  of  this  Pious  Institution  in  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus.  May  I                     achieve the longed, loving union with my supreme goodness! (S.C. Vol. 10, page                     7).                         4. His defects                              Before going on, let us listen to the Father's confession of                     his  own  defects.  \"His  dominant  passion  was  gluttony;  he  never  subdued  it                     entirely.  May  Jesus  forgive  him!  ...  Sleepy,  he  never  triumphed  over  sleep:                     during the night and the afternoon, he slept a good seven hours... Under the","pretext of health, he was tied to the comforts of life...\" (S.C. Vol. 7, pages 241-                     242).                          A  theologian  censor  points  out:  \"We  must  be  on  guard,  because  'the  just                     charges himself with something.' Besides, a hard working person of good health                     cannot be charged with gluttony, because he needs food.\" About sleep, \"Sleep is                     a natural need, above all for the ones who are busy all day and part of the night.\"                          Writes Fr. Vitale:                           \"Naturally,  he  suffered  from  hunger  and  such  a  stimulus  was  an  inner                     suffering that led him to think of sanctification as an impossible goal for him.                     Attacked by faintness, at times he had to eat something. As for sleep, he slept                     soundly through the night; to break sleep was a pain\" (Ibid. page 312).                           Once,  a  family  invited  him  to  a  dinner.  Because  they  were  late,  he  began                     failing and asked for a piece of bread to stay on his feet. At the same time he                     pointed out his physical and moral weackness to those people.                          Witnesses lay stress on his spirit of mortification. \"He practiced temperance                     exactly. His whole life seemed to me a continuous renunciation to appetite. I am                     told  that  up  to  forty  years  of  age  he  fasted  so  hard  that  he  got  a  nervous                     breakdown. After that, he somehow abated such a fervor of mortification.\"                          A  sister  remembers  the  1893  illness  of  the  Father.  \"When  he  was  sick,  he                     complained for being unable to get rid of the comforts and of the cares he was            711                     given by the sisters and a brother. With evident simplicity, he said that he was                     missing the times when he scourged himself, bore the cilice, slept on the bench,                     cut food, and did vigil in prayer.\"                          His strength grown feeble, his greater labors, and the  guide of his spiritual                     directors forbade him to continue hard penance. But he contained himself under                     an extraordinary mortification up to his last.","5. His dinner                              The  father  held  that  the  mortification  of  the  taste  is  the  beginning  of  the                     spiritual  life.  To  avoid  detriment  to  the  spirit  during  dinner,  he  recommended                     attention to the spiritual reading in the refectory. In the early times he bought                     plates  written  with  maxims  like,    \"While  eating,  think  of  the  poor  who  have                     nothing,\" \"Let us imitate the most holy Virgin's temperance,\" \"More men perish                     by over-eating than by the sword,\" etc.                          Now let's move to the Father's sins of taste and his lavish banquet.                          He drank no wine until 1893, when a  disease prostrated him. Until then no                     wine  was  served  at  table,  except  when  we  had  guests.  By  disposition  of  the                     doctor he later  drank  a little bit of watered  wine, and he often did without it;                     hence several witnesses relate that he drank no wine. But he never drank liquor.                          Nor did he eat meat, saying that it was harmful to his stomach. We, however,                     thought he was doing penance. In fact, the doctor prescribed some meat for him,                     in his last years.                          He did without sugar and sweets. As to coffee, the sisters ground acorn for                     him...  One  of  them  says,  \"One  day,  I  took  the  liberty  of  serving  a  doughnut                     instead of bread. He roughly refused it, saying, 'You play the devil!'  (I related                     the  fact  to  the  mother  superior).  I  knelt  to  beg  pardon,  and  he  did  the  same   712                     smiling and saying,  'Besides, you made a good doughnut.' In addition to the fast                     by the Church, he fasted 4 times a week, and ate  no fruit on Friday and Saturday.                     Unaware, he once ate fruit on a Saturday at Taormina. Back to Messina, he told                     me,  'Sister, don't serve fruit for a week; I have to do penance for the fruit I ate at                     Taormina'.\"                          His daily food was some pasta seasoned with oil and toasted bread grated with                     bitter  centaury,  which  grows  in  our  fields.  He  said  that  centaury  avoided  or                     attenuated stomach disorder; we","instead  thought  he  was  doing  penance,  because  he  put  that  seasoning  as  a                     penance in May. Obviously, several of the sisters or orphans were unable to gulp                     down that bitterness.                          A  brother  remembers,  \"I  waited  on  him  for  long  time.  He  liked  milk  and                     toasted bread for breakfast; at lunch and dinner, some noodles seasoned with oil                     and butter, more some fish or eggs.\"                          Brother Mary Anthony reports, \"One day at Naples,  I paid a lira for an egg.                     The Father told me not to buy eggs any longer, because they were expensive.\"                     At Taormina, the mother superior told a sister to buy a fish for the Father. When                     the  fish  was  served,  the  Father  said  that  the  community  was  scandalized,  and                     asked who bought it.  When he knew that the door keeper did it, he kept the head                     of  the  fish  for  himself,  sent  a  portion  of  the  fish  to  the  door  keeper,  and                     demanded that we eat the remnant. He used to tell the cook, 'First, you prepare                     the necessary elements: bread and water.'  He always said that his dishes were                     many. Several times he skipped dinner, and suggested to us to do the same, but                     he  never  demanded  it.  Sometimes  he  refused  the  dish  concealing  the  penance                     under the pretext that the food was overcooked, or salty, and the like.                          The following is an incident which happened to me in the first month of my                     entrance in the institute.                          Worker  Scatigna  cooked  eggs  with  asparagus,  and  presented  the  delicious                     dish to the Father. He thanked heartily, but said smiling, \"This is not a dish for a                     man, but for a boy...\" Then he called me who was waiting on, and said, \"Please            713                     come here, eat it. It will do good to you...\"                          \"There  was  no  chance  that  the  Father  ate  a  dish  different  from  the                     community's, even on the solemnities when we had guests. He sometimes did so                     reluctantly in his last years, when he was sick.\"                          Remembering  the  opening  of  the  house  in  Gravina,  a  person  who  met  the                     Father  for  the  first  time  relates,  \"I  was  struck  from  the  beginning  by  his                     simplicity and modesty.  I was going to prepare a better matress for him, but I                     was told to treat him as the others. On the inauguration day we ate bread and                     cheese, and so he did, refusing eggs and something else.\" \"He ate like a bird. He                     was the despair of the mother superior who prepared a soup for him, because of                     his illness. He instead gave it up to the sick, and demanded the common dish.                     Very  observant  of  the  ecclesiastical  fasting,  he  added  other  ones  of  his  own,                     above all when he was waiting for graces.\"  Mrs. Mazza Helen of Oria, a former","probationer  of  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal,  reports  that  the  Father  refused  a                     dish of good pasta prepared for him, and ate a wormish watery mash with broad                     bean peels.\"  A former orphan says, \"In my hard time, the Father's dish was like                     ours.\"                          The evidences from the Daughters of the Sacred Side are similar.                           Everytime  he  came  over,  he  ate  soup,  vegetables,  and  some  eggs,  refusing                     wine and coffee. Being rigorous with himself, he somehow showed liberality to                     us. He ate little, had no preference for food, and observed the fast imposed by the                     Church. As moderate eater, he was satisfied with a boiled potato and some eggs.                     Once,  I  saw  him  sprinkling  his  dish  with  powder.  We  knew  he  did  so  for                     penance. The several times he ate with us, any occasion was good to eat little; for                     instance,  he  got  up  to  check  quality  and  quantity  of  our  food,  and  finding  it                     scarse he ordered additional  meat for the community. Everytime he ate with us,                     he distributed part of his dish to the needier ones. Some of us noticed that he                     sprinkled his dish with powder.                          6. Still about the Father's dinner                                                        714                              It's worthy  insisting on  the normal use  of centaury    by the Father. He was                     always supplied with it.                          We knew this powder from the plants of our garden in Oria, which was dried                     up  and  powdered  by  the  sisters.  One  of  them  testifies,  \"One  day  Mother                     Nazzarena handled me a sheaf of bitter herb to bake and powder it. The Servant                     of God used it to give a disgustful taste to the food.\"                          Says  Brother  Louis,  \"Once,  I  happened  to  go  to  the  Father.  The  room  was                     open and he was writing. On the table there was a snuff-box. He asked me if I                     took snuff, and handled me a little bit, recommending to put it directly on my                     tongue. I did so. It was in the morning. In the evening I was still feeling the acrid                     bitter  taste;  and  yet,  I  had  eaten  twice.  When  I  related  the  fact  to  Father                     Bonarrigo, he told me, 'The powder is centaury.  The","Father often takes it by mortification.' I think that someone else knew his custom.                     But, when he ate in the community no one perceived it.\"                          Or  better  yet,  Brother  Louis  did  not  notice  it,  because  the  Father  tried  to                     conceal  himself  while  using  the  powder,  but  without  succeeding  sometimes.                     \"Despite  the  attempts,  now  and  then  I  perceived  that  he  was  sprinkling  the                     powder on his dish. We knew that he carried worm-wood to help digestion, as he                     said. To sprinkle the food secretly, he pretended to use the handkerchief in which                     he had concealed a dose. One day a cook tasted the remnant of the Father's dish.                     He wished he had never done so, so bitter it was.                          In  Taormina  the  Father  happened  to  have  his  snuff-box  empty.  Says  the                     mother superior, \"He asked me whether in the community we used to do some                     penance in the food. I answered, 'Yes, Father. we sprinkle the dish with cassia or                     quinine powder, once in May.'  He told me, 'I am going to taste it to see whether                     your  penance  is  serious,'    and  handled  me  his  empty  snuff-box.  Evidently,  he                     chose this excuse to conceal and supply himself with powder.\"                          When he was at the sisters' community, he ate by himself, therefore he had                     more  liberty  to  season  his  food;  the  sisters,  however,  perceived  the  strange                     flavoring. \"He delighted in seasoning the dish with aloe and absinth. One day a                     sister happened to give up her food to a poor and was glad to eat the Father's                     soup  because  she  thought  it  was  blessed.  She  was  unable  to  eat  it  all  for  its                     bitterness and bad smell, and vomited soon after.\" The sisters who waited on him                     \"confided  to  us  that  the  Servant  of  God  bittered  his  food  with  aloe,  and     715                     sometimes used that powder in a drink under the pretext to help digestion.\" \"I                     have  come  to  know  that  he  was  frugal,  and  I  myself  once  realized  that  he                     sprinkled  his  dish  with  bitter  powder.  To  imitate  him  in  the  penance,  our                     community  once  bittered  the  food,  but  I  gulped  down  only  a  few  spoonfuls.\"                     \"While  boiling  the  water  to  make  a  barley  drink,  he    poured  fried  bread  and                     powder in the cup. One day he stopped doing so to go elsewhere, and I tasted it                     with the bread. It was very bitter. When the Father came back, he asked for the                     bread, and I confessed my curiosity. He told me to keep silent.\"","7. More mortification                              Let us see additional mortifications of another kind in the food.                          \"Generally  he  did  not  eat  meat,  and  while  traveling  he  preferred  cold  eggs                     without salt because they were tasteless\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page                     3l4).                          \"To  feel  no  taste,  he  wanted  the  food  overcooked.\"    \"The  little  he  ate  was                     overcooked,  but  he  took  great  care  of  the  others'  food  about  quantity  and                     quality.\" \"As to himself, he was absolutely indifferent to the food's quality, but                     was very careful of the orphans' and the Religious' food.\"                          \"By negligence, I once cooked rice without salt. He remarked that, but added,                     'Do not mind. In Rome I do not use salt, because it is expensive over there'.\"                          The Father delighted in some things and felt repugnance against others. But                     he fought  and won. A mother superior reports, \"One day he confided to me that                     he  had  felt  a  repugnance  against  the  bread-soup  since  he  was  a  child,  but                     endeavored to overcome it. Once I cooked a dish in my own way, trying to make                     it delicious, but he told me,  'That's not good,'  and guided me to the kitchen. He                     poured the bread-soup in a small pot and stirred it up. Then he swallowed it. He                     did so to win the repugnance that he had not overcome yet.\" A sister assures that                     \"in Trani he chose the sister as a personal cook that the community had refused           716                     because of her inefficiency.\"                          Thirst was another habitual penance of the Father. He was short of wine, but                     he did not even quench his thirst with water.                          Because Melanie used to \"sip a little bit of water,\" he tried to imitate her. But                     he said, \"I was unable, because one cannot quench thirst this way\" (Vol. 45, page                     l8l). He succeeded when he renounced to quench his thirst completely. Listen to                     the evidences. \"He drank a little bit of watered wine. Usually, he sipped water for                     penance in the afternoon to imitate Melanie, and","he quoted her saying, 'We must not drink to satiety, as the animals!' When I saw                     him coming back home, I used to bring a jug of fresh water to his room. One day                     I was late, and found him on the treshold. He asked me, 'What day is today?'                     'Friday,'  I  answered.  'Oh,  if  you  knew  how  much  thirst,  how  many  sins,  how                     much  reparation!  No,  thanks!  The  following  morning  he  told  me,  'Last  night,                     Jesus left me a little thirsty and kept me wide-awake. I suffered willingly, also                     because there was no jug'!\"  Mother Nazzarena used to tell us that the Servant of                     God never satisfied hunger and thirst in full. \"He sipped water, and we thought                     he  did  so  for  penance.\"  \"I  heard  that  he  drank  water  moderately  to  avoid                     satisfying thirst completely.\" Says Father Santoro, \"When he was near to death, I                     suggested to him to drink some cordial, but he faintly answered, 'I never satisfy                     thirst in full'!\"                          Abstinence from fruit was one of his frequent mortifications. For instance, he                     always  abstained  from  eating  white  figs  in  honor  of  the  child  Jesus.  \"He                     abstained easily from fruit.\" \"We witnessed to his acts of mortification restricting                     food  and  drink.\"  \"During  triduos,  novenas,  and  preparation  for  solemnities  he                     suggested abstinence from fruit, giving the example. The saving was given to the                     poor.\" \"During the year, he observed the abstinence from fruit which had been                     drawn by lots in January.\" \"On Saturday, we did not eat fruit. In the solemnities,                     we were relieved from the annual abstinence from the fruit drawn by lots, except                     the Father.\" He often exchanged with people the act of penance, reserving the                     harder one for himself. It usually happened when someone did not accept with              717                     generosity  the  penance  drawn  by  lots.  \"Once,  in  Oria,    he  drew  by  lots  the                     abstinence  from  all  fruits  during  the  whole  year,  and  the  following  year  the                     abstinence  from  all  sweets.  What  a  joy  for  him,  who  did  the  penance                     scrupulously.  We  instead  were  relieved  from  this  kind  of  abstinence  now  and                     then.\"                          To avoid that sweetness remain in the mouth, when cake and fruit were served                     up, the Father wanted the congregants to eat first the cake.  And when various                     fruits were served up, he ate only from one species.                          Reports a sister,                           He liked figs and peaches.  But he confided to me that he was abstaining from                     them  since  25  years  as  an  offering  to  Our  Lady  and  Jesus.  With  regard  to                     peaches, he told me that during his convalescence the brother who was waiting                     on him succeeded to make him eat one; the following year, however, the peach                     tree dried up. He concluded, 'What","we offer to the Lord is sacred, therefore we must never fail  to fulfill our vow.'                     He liked home-made cake; after our insisting he ate a little bit of it. One day I                     dared to present to him a piece of chocolate I had softened in the kitchen because                     of his weakly teeth, but I had to retire. He said that the sisters and the orphans                     could be scandalized by that.                           Says Father Vitale, \"I remember that he abstained from fruit for two years in                     succession.\"  I read in his notes, \"Abstinence from fruit for five  years. I began on                     August  4,  l907\"  (Vol.  6,  page  ll8).  I  have  no  reason  to  think  that  he  stopped                     continuing such a penance, save that the l908 earthquake made it impossible for                     some time.                        8. Instruments of penance                            Cilice and scourge, the tools used frequently by legions of saints, were also                     the instruments of penance used by the Father.                          Writes Father Vitale,                           \"More than once in the morning, I heard him crying meekly while praying,             718                     perhaps because of instruments of penance  he used, e.g. a hairshirt, little chains,                     pinchers, whips, pointed crosses, etc. that did not pass unnoticed to the curious                     eye of his intimate acquaintances. Sometimes his innocent body bled\" (Ibid. page                     3l3).                           In  Oria  we  preserve  a  collection  of  such  instruments:  a  hard  iron  scourge,                     metal strings with sharp iron points, a broad belt full with sharp iron, hairshirts,                     and whips. A Religious thinks that these instruments were not for the Father's                     personal use. He says, \"To my knowledge, the instruments of penance we have at                     Oria were not used by the Father. He took most of them away from the persons                     he directed.\"                          The  witnesses  instead  affirm  that  the  Father  was  familiar  with  these                     instruments. Therefore, most of them, such as the","pointed iron belt, were not taken away from too fervent persons. Sister Gertrude                     testifies, \"The Father wanted two broad body belts: one in Messina, and the other                     one in Oria. Within the cloth we sewed hooked barbed wire projecting outside.                     Both the mother superior and I did it.\"  Witnesses confirm it.  In September, on                     the feast of Our Lady of Sorrows, \"we perceived that the Father was wearing this                     belt because after preaching very compassionately about the pains of Our Lady,                     he kissed the altar by bending his knees and his head, without bending his body.\"                     A sister of Taormina relates, \"One day I found on his bed a belt of strong cloth                     having sharp points like needles. I retired without touching it. Later I heard that                     the Father wore it during the mass.\" \"I heard from the sisters that the Servant of                     God  used  instruments  of  penance,  that  his  shirt  was  sometimes  found  blood-                     stained, and that he himself  sometimes washed his shirt because of the blood,                     perhaps.\" \"Once I saw some cotton wool  soaked with blood in the basin. I do not                     know if that was due to scourge.\" In l9l5, the Father went to Soccorso along with                     Father Chiapparone for priestly ministry, and lived in the Cigala house as a guest                     for eight days. One day he left the door of his room opened, and Mrs. Cigala                     entered to clean the room. She saw a pointed instrument of penance. Back home,                     the Father asked whether anyone had entered his room. The lady had no courage                     to say the truth on that occasion.                          \"Because sometimes he could not bend, we thought it was due to the hair-                     shirts. Once I saw the sheets with spots of blood.\"  \"I often saw some instruments                     of penance in the bedside table that I opened by curiosity. Asked by him who had          719                     moved them, I confessed.  'Keep silent,' he said. 'Don't do it any more'.\" \"On the                     occasion of the l908 earthquake, he recommended the scourge and to wear the                     hair-shirt during the day; later he suggested to wear it only during the mass. I                     think he was the first to do so, because he used to say, 'Let us do penance!'  Since                     he prohibited to make up his bed, we gossiped that he also used such instruments                     in the night.\"                          He used additional tormenting instruments of penance, such as the  pinchers                     to  mortify  his  finger-tips,  eyelids,  ears,  lips,  tongue,  etc.,  especially  when  he                     prayed with raised hands, kneeling.                          Mr. Pisani of Oria relates,                           I  was  a  valet  of  Antonio  Di  Tommaso,  bishop  of  Oria,  when  Canon  Di                     Francia came the first time to talk with the bishop. He lodged in the episcopal                     palace several times. He did so for about a month before","settling his institutes in that town. From the first days I was struck by the spirit of                     poverty and penance of this unknown priest. It was my duty to wait on and to                     clean the rooms. At table he disliked to use more than one plate, and in the night                     he  did  not  use  the  woolen  matress  and  the  pillow,  which  I  found  clean.                     Obviously,  he  removed  them  and  slept  on  the  vegetable  hair  matress,  putting                     them back at their place in the morning. About the cleaning, he always preceded                     me. When I found him cleaning, I impeded him with polite manners, because it                     was my duty. He always refused to light the nightly candle, saying that one can                     also pray in the darkness, nor he used the cake of soap I put on the wash-basin                     (he used common soap).                           The Father laid the foundations of our communities in Oria with penance and                     prayer.                          Occasional  penances  did  not  fail.  At  Montemurro's,  he  was  given  a  cup  of                     milk with salt instead of sugar. He drank it silently. When the cook perceived it,                     he  was  amazed  at,  but  it  was  too  late.  On  another  occasion,  some  boys  were                     playing a low see-saw, and the Father delighted in seeing them. In the rush, the                     plank went over the feet of the Father, who reacted with a smile at the protests of                     the boys, and continued watching their play.                                                                                                                 720                      9. His fight against sleep                             Now let us talk of sleep. He used to say  that he had a weakness for sleep.                     While  traveling  by  train,  he  slept  easily.  But  he  added,  and  wrote  in  his  own                     funeral oration that he slept seven hours a day, on the whole.                          We must admit that fight against sleep is one of the hardest even for the saints                     who  distinguished  themselves  in  mortification.  Saint  Catherine  of  Siena                     confessed  to  Blessed  Raymond,  her  spiritual  director,  that  she  never  found  so                     hard difficulty in anything as in winning sleep (Papasogli, Sangue e fuoco sul                     Ponte di Dio, page 23). The Father's fight against sleep was never-ending.","As to sleep, the Father counted on prayer as he did for mortification. Here is a                     prayer to the most holy Heart of Jesus to win sleep.                           Adorable  Lord  Jesus  Christ,  you  told  us  to  be  watchful  and  taught  us                     watchfulness  in  many  ways.  Please  grant  me  the  grace  of  being  vigilant;                     strengthen my feeble nature and my unsteady will so that I may endure and win                     out over the lethargy of sleep. Our Lord Jesus Christ, I appeal to your Sacred                     Heart that was watchful even when you were sleeping. Heart of my Jesus, excite                     faith, fervor, and zeal in my cold heart in order that I may turn from so much                     sleep and may be fond of prayerful watchfulness. My Jesus, you poured out the                     charity of  your heart all nights, praying in the fields, or the mountains, or the                     caves, or at home in Nazareth. Please grant me the favor of shortening my sleep                     in order that I may spend the extra time before you, crying for the interests of                     your Sacred Heart.                          My  Lord,  you  see  that  the  spirit  is  willing,  but  nature  is  weak.  I  am  very                     miserable and feeble; the donkey wants to lie down. My Redeemer, for the merits                     of your divine vigils, let me win sleep, render me watchful so that I may confess                     you in the heart of night, according to the prophet! Amen.                           Then he invokes the most holy Virgin \"model of the watchful virgins\"; Saint                     John of the Cross, who treasured  \"time wisely,  lovingly  spending the night in                     prayer\"; and his holy guardian angel to \"win a pretty victory over sleep  in order        721                     to  spend  the  night  together  with  him  in  fervent  prayer  for  the  interests  of  the                     Sacred Heart of Jesus\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page 25).                          Seven hours of sleep were on the schedule, but the Father spent nights before                     the Blessed Sacrament when the  material and spiritual needs of the institution                     were urgent - and it was not unusual. A sister remembers, \"Mother Nazzarena                     told me that the Father had to perform his spiritual duties in the night because                     during the day was busy with people.\" Another sister says, \"I often saw him in                     the  heart  of  the  night  in  the  chapel,  and  in  the  morning  he  was  already  there                     before the reveille.\"                          He confessed to be hungry and sleepy, but it was because he ate as a sparrow                     and slept less than it was  due.                          He  called  himself  a  sleeper,  but  at  4:30  a.m.  he  was  out  of  the  bed,  even                     though he went to sleep late. He was often seen in the night going through the                     dormitories with the petroleum lamp, and when we kept vigil, he was the first to                     enter the chapel.                          In summer time, he rested half an hour in the afternoon; in winter time, never.","As to the bed, he was easily pleased. He said that he was unable to sleep on a soft                     matress. His  woolen matress laid down on planks, and he never let people shake                     it up. The change of his laundry happened once a week, he himself made up the                     blankets, and sometimes he slept on the planks, or on the ground.                          Sister  Ausilia  confided  to  me  that  when  the  Servant  of  God  went  to  Saint                     Eufemia in l9l8 to preach on the feast of Immaculate Mary, he told her to never                     make up his bed. At the end of his staying she saw on the matress, dot marks                     from the instruments of penance.  Father Vitale wrote,                           More than once when he was a youth, he spent the night praying or sleeping                     on the ground. In Castiglione, where he preached a triduo in honor of Our Lady                     of Lourdes, people noticed that he did not use his bed; the same thing happened                     at Saint Fratello on the occasion of his preaching to the Daughters of Mary. At                     Torre Grotta in l926, even though he was 75, he slept on the ground because the                     sisters had prepared a comfortable bed with a woolen matress (Ibid. page 6l6).                           While concluding, we point out that the various mortifications of the Father                     did not hinder his activity. \"Despite his penances, I think that the Father worked                     more.\"  \"Despite  his  mortifications,  I  noticed  no  fault  in  the  fulfillment  of  his                     duty.\"                                                                                                                722                      10. Kindness and meekness                              Chastity,  humility,  and  kindness,  or  meekness,  are  linked  together  with                     temperance as subjective or potential parts of it. Here, we speak of meekness.                     We'll treat chastity and humility later.                          Meekness prevents or moderates anger, letting us bear and treat our neighbor                     with kindness, his defects notwithstanding. It is an excellent virtue, whose model                     is  Jesus  (Mt.  ll,  29),  but  is  also  a  hard  virtue  that  implies  the  death  of  our                     interests. In particular,","it  is  the  virtue  of  the  innocent  persons,  in  whom  Jesus  has  established  his                     dwelling.  Bossuet  wrote  that  meekness  is  \"the  true  sign  of  innocence,  either                     preserved or recovered\" (Meditazioni sul Vangelo, giorno 3).                          The Father notices that meekness and humility are closely                     linked together.                           Meekness is a daughter of holy humility, which helps the people to become                     humble.  Each  Rogationist  will  be  most  vigilant  in  the  exercise  of  this  virtue,                     bearing in mind our Lord Jesus Christ's words, \"Learn from me, because I am                     gentle and humble of spirit\" (Lk. ll, 29). Looking to his divine example, each                     congregant will excel in this elect virtue in every circumstance by controlling and                     mortifying himself. Even though one may be somehow angry without sinning,                     while admonishing for necessity, usually we have to be meek while speaking (we                     should  almost  always  speak  in  a  low  voice),  while  commanding,  but  over  all                     while relating with our neighbor so that no one be scandalized (Vol. 3, page 2l).                          Each superior is warmly urged to keep himself calm and perfectly meek in                     every  event,  because  his  excitement  rebounds  on  his  subjects.  It  is  written:                     \"Yahveh was not in the wind\"  (l King, l9,ll), for he is the spirit of eternal peace.                     The superior is not forbidden to feel the impressions of the events, to share them                     intensely, and to act with fervor and concern in the circumstances, but he must                     never loose his internal calmness, for wisdom consists in combining concern and                     fervor with internal quiet, which makes everything proceed in order. Here is the          723                     rub: the superior will never act by passion, which is the source  of these vices:                     anger, furor, and wrath. If he feels them, he must not consent to them (Vol. l,                     page l32).                          Meekness! Saint Francis of Sales says that this virtue should prevail over the                     others  like  oil  floating  on  water.  Such  a  virtue  is  necessary  to  everyone,  but                     especially to the superior for many reasons.                          The  first  reason  is  good  example.  Irascibility  is  common  among  human                     beings, but  emotions of impatience are more spread among the Religious. The                     hellish enemy exploits the persons' inclination to irascibility and impatience by                     working upon it. Unless the superior prevails over this passion perfectly through                     meekness, he is unable to work as he should, and, therefore, he jeopardizes his                     subjects on the devil's behalf!  Very soon his impatience, his very first emotions,                     outbursts, resentments, agitated talks, and the like unbridle each Religious' anger,                     deranging the community in such a way that the spiritual building collapses.                          Each  one  will  be  meek,  but  the  superior  more.    To  reach  this  beautiful,                     beloved  virtue  which  draws  other  virtues  with  itself,  one  must  practice  it  and                     pray for it all his life long. We read, \"In all that is right he guides the humble\"                     (Ps. 24, 9). It means that God guides the meek superior's actions and words in the                     ways of his divine will, enabling him to lead his subjects to Jesus Christ (Vol. l,                     page 204).","Let us glean from the Father's teaching.                           Meekness is a sister of humility, and our Lord Jesus Christ suggests to learn                     from him who is gentle of heart. The merits of this virtue are ineffable. We must                     wish  that  the  Lord  will  always  send  gentle  souls  to  this  institute,  making                     meekness bloom among us. This virtue is a sword which kills the vices of human                     nature, and turns us very dear to God and men. Since each of us is somehow                     tormented by anger, the practice of this virtue engages us in a continuous fight                     against ourselves.  Jesus' example of meekness stands out over the other ones,                     charming  the  people  who  meditate  upon  it.  Jesus  Christ  was  insulted,  beaten,                     outraged beyond any saying. Through the Jews, the hellish enemy endeavored to                     arouse Jesus' indignation against his persecutors, but his divine Heart's favorite                     virtue confused the whole hell.                          After Jesus, the most holy Virgin is a perfect model of meekness. Jesus was                     called \"lamb\"; Mary, \"dove,\" which has no bile. She never got angry against the                     torturers of her  divine son, but loved and prayed for them.                          The saints loved meekness so  much. To  become  meek, they fought against                     their nature with a will for years. Keeping oneself perfectly meek in  any event is                     too hard, but whoever wins himself, he wins the palm of martyrdom. The holy                     Spirit said that whoever wins his own heart, is stronger than anyone.                          The  congregants  will  pay  careful  attention  to  achieve  this  beautiful  virtue.                     They will beware of any fit of anger when they are contradicted, being mutually           724                     meek.  But, when they treat with other people, they will show this virtue more. It                     is written, 'Avoid rash judgements, because it implies sin.' And elsewhere, 'Have                     you ever seen anyone rushing in his talk? It is easier to correct foolishness  than                     such a person.' It is a very good habit to talk slowly, and in a low voice (S.C.                     Vol. l0, page l94).                         11. Prayer for edification                              The Father's life was perfectly corresponding to his teaching.                          He  wrote  in  his  funeral  oration,  \"By  nature,  he  was  irascible,  and                     unfortunately he never subdued his somewhat vulgar anger\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page                     24l). Writing to Father","Vitale  he  renews  the  charge  against  himself,  \"Your  letter  reflects  your  meek,                     candid, gentle soul before which my riotous, harsh soul clashes\" (Vol.32, page                     45). We have no difficulty to acknowledge that he was irascible by nature, but                     saying that he did not succeed to tame himself is incorrect.                          The censors of his writings point out,                           That  he  was  of  vulgar  irascibility  does  not  appear  from  his  writing,  he  is                     rather  incline  to  tolerance,  forgiveness,  and  peace  with  all.  He  writes  with                     resentful  tone  only  the  article  for  the  rescue  of  the  beggars,  who  had  no                     alternative: starving or going to jail (Vol. 43, page 20-23). When he defends the                     rights  of  his  institutes,  he  does  so  calmly  on  the  ground  of  legal  reasons.  He                     recommends patience, moderation, and fine manners to the mother superiors.                           Another censor writes,                           From the results of his writing we cannot say that he was irascible, or worse,                     of a somewhat vulgar anger by nature.                          On the contrary, he is usually sympathetic, benevolent, delicate, tolerant, but                     very firm in the principles; as well as strong-minded and resolute in the matters                     which  were  more  correspondent  to  good  and  to  the  aims  of  his  institution.  It                     seems to us that the Servant of God meant to say that by nature he felt himself                     inclined  to  anger.  We  admit  that  he  may  have    sometimes  showed  signs  of      725                     agitation or impatience, or expressed hard opinions about someone, because the                     Servant of God was a little impulsive and bellicose by nature. All this proves that                     he hardly strove to achieve mental, emotional balance, and self-control, to which                     his writings bear witness.                           In  his  prayer  we  find  the  first  evidences  of  his  hard  efforts  to  achieve                     meekness. We have already quoted the ones for the daily behavior (ch. 7, no. 6)                     and  for  the  mortification  (ch.  l,  no.  4).  Now  we  quote  the  prayer  for  the                     edification.  He  implores  the  grace  to  overcome  irascibility  and  to  achieve                     gentleness and meekness.                           O Jesus, gentle and humble of heart, renders my heart like yours! My supreme                     goodness, even though I do not deserve it, please forgive my defects. See to it                     that this wretched man be not a cause of scandal! Give me holy enlightenment,                     quick reflection, presence of mind, calm  reasonableness, fortitude and patience                     to control myself in any occasion. May I not cause scandal through impatience,                     intolerance, emotion, alteration, nuisance, rashness,  fits of temper, resentments,                     piques,  and  free  play;  as  well  as  through  words  somehow  imprudent,  or  little                     modest,","or little humble. For the sake of yourself, for the sake of the souls for whom you                     paid so dear and you want to edify, grant me this great grace! Above all, bridle                     my tongue! For the sake of your tongue bittered with bile, bridle my perverse                     tongue! To avoid stumbling over the mistakes of my tongue, see to it that before                     talking I consider my words in the light of the evangelical perfection and reason.                     My beloved Jesus, grant me the virtue of knowing how to keep silent, grant me                     the precious virtue of silence! Lord, lock my mouth, and let me talk the words                     that circumstances require.                          Sweetest heart of my Jesus, compress my perverse heart and free me once for                     all  from  the    foolish,  irrational  impulses  of  irascibility.  In  the  moments  of                     irascibility avert the hellish enemy, awaken in my mind the holy considerations                     that disperse the foolish thoughts. If the enemy presses, give me enough strength                     to prevail over him. Let me keep in mind that meekness, control of the impulses,                     and gentleness in talking prevent me from plenty of defects, render me edifying                     to  my  neighbor, get  me closer to  you,  my  supreme  goodness,  and help things                     succeed more than any fit of anger. For the sake of your gentlest heart, hear me.                     O Lord, remember David and all his meekness. Through your efficacious grace                     see to it that I behave among the poor and  children with such edification and                     meekness as to offset the scandal I have caused with my impatience! My Jesus                     restorer, let me make up abundantly and quickly for my errors (S.C. Vol. l0, page                     4).                                                                                                               726                          To  impetrate  such  a  grace,  the  Father  continues  invoking  the  Immaculate                     Heart of Mary, Saint Joseph, the guardian angel, and several saints, such as Saint                     Francis  of  Sales,  Saint  John  of  the  Cross,  Saint  Alphonsus  Mary  Liguori,                     Veronica Giuliani, the angels and saints patrons, and all souls of purgatory. The                     resolves we have quoted at ch. l, no. 5, are added here.                          In a note to his personal prayers, the Father writes, \"Three Hail Marys, and                     three  Glory  to  bes  to  win  irascibility.  Resolves:  do  not  complain  for  personal                     things;  meekness  in  everything;  humble  and  calm    patience  during  opposition                     and suffering\" (Vol. 6, page ll7).","12. His unshakable peace                              As to how the Father was faithful to his resolves, we have already said a lot in                     the past chapters. Now we quote additional evidences.                          To begin with, we transcribe a beautiful page by Father Vitale.                           Tender and compassionate hearted by nature, the Father worked upon himself                     through  grace  and  efforts.  He  also  endeavored  to  duplicate  the  model  of  the                     divine Redeemer in himself with a singular meekness and gentleness.                          While treating with Religious, lay men, great and humble persons, friends and                     enemies, the Father behaved  so affably as to captivate their hearts. They knew                     they  could  count  on  him  for  everything  which  was  in  harmony  with  his  very                     delicate conscience.                          Among the Servants of God committed to charity toward our neighbor, our                     Father has something unusual. In the early times of the institution, when he was                     unable to quickly pay off, his creditors were sometimes determined to manifest                     their heavy remonstrances, up to insult him, if necessary. But, as soon as they                     drew close to him, and he said a word, they surrendered as meek lambs. They                     understood that they were dealing with an exceptional man of the Lord.                          Certainly, several persons abused his kindness, failed in their office, or did not   727                     keep  their  word.  Then  he  mildly  complained  about,  almost  wailing,                     'Unfortunately,  they  do  not  like  the  paternal  government.  They  would  deserve                     rigor.'                          The Father often experienced a contrast  in his spirit.  When  his fortitude in                     meeting the requirements  of the virtue demanded the punishment of the guilty to                     make  him  up,  the  Father  almost    seemed  excessive  in  correcting  and  in                     punishing.  But  a  hint  of  repentance  from  the  guilty  was  enough  to  render  the                     Father mild and gentle. Then, by mitigating or eliminating the punishment,                     he attained the results he was longing for.                          When  the  Father  was  driven  to  be  severe  with  someone  and  seemed    as                     though he was disturbed and unwilling to hear about that person, if he happened                     to know that the guilty had repented, then he sought to talk in any way: through a                     smile or a glance - oh, how gentle it was. He seemed like saying, \"I am always                     your Father, and you my son!\"  Those who knew how to read in his heart, how                     they appreciated him!                          Without  a  true  understanding  of  the  Father's  spirit,  some  acts  of  his                     governments cannot be explained. But now we are unable to touch upon details,                     because they could scandalize instead of edifying.(l)                          More than once he had to dismiss some persons who had no vocation,","or had committed faults grave with respect to their state. Perhaps, other superiors                     would have not received them again in the community, but the Father was not                     this  sort  of  man.  He  could  not  understand  that  a  person  is  unable  to  radically                     change his/her disposition, once the person has acknowledged his/her wrong. For                     this reason he could not help admitting them again, on condition that they resolve                     to improve their lives. Those who sometimes opposed his decision, were mildly                     told,  \"Saint Francis of Sales says that the congregants who are gone out can be                     readmitted up to three times...\"                          He recommended the people who shared the superiority to join firmness with                     gentleness, to avoid demanding the same things from all, and to ban harshness                     and natural strictness which can achieve external discipline, but interior virtue.                     We bore witness to plenty of facts, which revealed how gentle and meek of heart                     the Father was! Once, he made a few wise remarks about my way of acting in                     discipline, and I realized that he was sorry. I felt to beg pardon, and knelt asking                     for  forgiveness.  He  also  knelt  saying,  \"You  must  forgive  me,  because  I  am                     unable to reach certain high levels of perfection.\"  But his kneeling manifested                     his very high perfection...                          In his last  years he did his best to achieve heroism in the practice of these                     virtues. He never lost his temper. Not at all. Even in the low sound of his voice                     he  endeavored  to  be  always  mellifluous.  His  words  penetrated  our  hearts  as  a                     celestial balm. Everyone perceived his utmost attention to practicing meekness in                     the highest degree. He seemed to be willing to prepare himself to death with a            728                     deep peacefulness of spirit, the peace which is the prelude of the celestial glory.                           At this point Father Vitale refers to our Founder, who charges himself with                     anger in his funeral oration. He comments, \"For us who knew him intimately, his                     anger was the zeal of his heart for the observance of the law of God. His fight                     against the defects of nature ended with a splendid victory\" (Bulletin l929, pages                     l05-l08).                           We have heard from Father Vitale that the creditors were rather tolerant with                     our Founder, but not always, nor all of them. In fact, some witnesses testify that a                     few of the creditors threatened him with blows or accusation to the tribunals. But                     he  bore  everything  patiently,  completely  submitted  to  the  will  of  God.                     Meanwhile he generously forgave those who held him crazy and insulted him.                          Even though very busy with several works of zeal and with the needs of his                     communities, the Father kept his peace unshakable","in the midst of very bitter hardships. He had already achieved full self-control!                          How much he had to suffer to do good!                          A sister relates how much was done in Trani in the start of the institute to                     convince the faithful  to send their children to the churches for the catechism.                     The  Father  found  out  that  no  catechism  was  taught  in  the  parishes.  Upon                     agreement with Msgr. Carrano, one day the Father walked through the streets of                     Trani preceded by a youth carrying the cross, accompanied by Canon Tarantino,                     Don Alphonsus Gentile, Don Joseph Rossi,  and followed by  a few sisters. He                     rang the bell and invited the people to the cathedral. The church was crowded,                     and \"the Father talked about the religious education and the parents' duty to send                     their children to the parishes. The sisters would teach them catechism. Because                     the  clergy  did  not  cooperate  with  the  zealous  sisters  at  the  beginning  of  their                     teaching,  they  disheartened  and  liked  to  withdraw.  But  the  Father  supported,                     encouraged, and said to them, \"Be patient, trust in God, and everything will be                     fine.\" Thanks to God, the organization of catechism improved.                          The Father was always resigned to the will of God in the various suffering of                     his life. No one ever heard from his mouth a sharp reproof or a complaint against                     anyone  who  did  evil  to  him.  His  maxim  was,  \"The  Lord  knows  what  he  is                     doing,\"  and exhorted his followers to imitate him. \"He quickly forgave anyone                     who wronged him, also helping him financially, if it was the case. He exhorted                     the  sisters  to  forgive  one  another,  and  to  make  peace  before  receiving                     Communion.\"                                                                               729                         13. Always eager for forgiveness                              Some witnesses remember the tribulations the Father endured with a Christian                     spirit. \"I can hardly think of someone who offended the Servant of God. In such a                     case, he would have imitated the divine teacher. Everywhere he passed through,                     he was respected and common people exclaimed, 'Padre Francia, Padre Francia'!\"                     It is evident that the reporter refers to the esteem the Servant of God enjoyed","everywhere, especially in his last years, but he does not exclude that the Father                     suffered  isolated  affronts  and  insults.  In  fact,  the  Father  himself  speaks  of  an                     'hellish  fight  that  the  city  hall  roused  against  him  when  the  concession  of  the                     Holy  Spirit  convent  to  him  was  put  to  the  vote'.\"  Nor  have  we  to  forget  the                     furious  barking  at  the  city  hall  to  deny  the  Father  the  financial  help  he  had                     requested. \"In the foundation of his institute, he faced plenty of grave obstacles.                     It is well known the revolt of the socialists and their fellows at the city hall and                     outside. They held Padre Francia as their rival, therefore they furiously barked to                     destroy his charitable institution since its beginning. The aid that the city hall had                     granted to the Father in the previous years was denied. The Father attended the                     meeting, but kept calm. The following day he wrote a renowned letter, insisting                     always more on his apostolate of redemption. Above all, he confided in God who                     is the source of any good, and neglected no human means nor natural resources.                     During  and  after  the  fury,  he  said  everything  in  confidence  at  the  foot  of  the                     Blessed Sacrament.\"                          As to the offences, these are the Father's feelings:                          Bewaring  of  nurturing  aversion  or  grudge  against  anyone,  still  less  against                     those who seem contrary or offensive to me, I promise the following:                          l. I will not be prone to believe that I have been offended, I will think instead                     that my imagination and selfishness amplify the  things making them appear grim                     to me.                          2.  If  someone  really  offends  me,  I  will  not  become  indignant,  but  I  will   730                     sympathize, love, and look on him  favorably, recommending him to the Lord in                     order to return good for evil\" (Vol. 44, page l20).                           Let us read the relations. He was eager for forgiveness, and unwilling to leave                     people  displeased.  He  was  so  inclined  to  compassion  and  forgiveness  that  he                     marveled  ingenuously,  because  he  felt  no    lack  of  respect  toward  those  who                     bothered him. Insulted several times especially while begging, he never reacted                     but heartily and easily forgave the people and the insult He kept in his mind this                     saying, \"May the sun never set on your anger.\" All should live in mutual peace                     and charity. \"He loved, forgave, and prayed for  his enemies, exhorting us to do                     the same.\" \"He often exhorted us with solemn and strong words to forgive our                     enemies. Sometimes we announced the visit of a person who had","misbehaved with the Servant of God, but he answered, 'At a greater reason he                     must  enter.'  One  day  he  scolded  some  Daughters  of  Mary,  and  their  relatives                     reacted  badly,  threatening  him  in  the  church.  By  prudence,  Sister  Maione                     suggested to stay in for some time, he instead did not worry and said that he had                     forgiven everything.\"                          \"Lawyer  Guardavaglia  related  to  me  that  at  Taormina  the  Father  was                     persecuted and insulted in many ways by the people who wanted to recover some                     buildings, but he always forgave heartily.\"                              Listen to Father Vitale.                           It is marvelous how the Father forgot the faults! His priestly ministry to his                     communities and souls, the sinners he converted, and the debauched he called                     back to Christian life, gave him occasions to deal with people who had fallen in                     the  abyss  of  very  grave  sins.  Many  of  them  repented  through  the  Father's                     ministry and were treated by him like the candid souls who were around him.                     Furthermore, he seized the opportunity to lay emphasis on their virtues in order                     to cancel any memory of their faults.                          Once, a bishop asked my opinion about a person who had taken a false step,                     but recovered with the grace of the Lord. I took advice from the Father on how I                     should behave. He answered, 'You respond that he is an angel!' Another bishop,                     alluding to a person recovered by the Father, said to me smiling, 'See what Father        731                     Francia wants me to give that converted! Did he forget what happened?...'                          Yes, like our Lord forgets the faults of his children, and hugs them lovingly as                     faithful ones, so the Father did (Bulletin l929, page l07).                           During the investigation of our community in Francavilla, people had ground                     for  believing  that  the    former  orphan  Morgante  worsened  the  position  of  the                     institute  with  his  lies.  The  Father  wrote  to  Father  Palma,  \"In  the  doubt  that                     Morgante  is  responsible,  treat  him  better  than  before,  pitying  and  giving  him                     more alms. We are Christians\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 56).                          When a probationer was dismissed from the institute for lack of vocation, her                     mother  spoke  ill  of  the  Father  and  the  sisters.  The  Father  invited  her  to  the                     institute, and gave her coffee and biscuits. Because a sister complained about, the                     Father told her, \"You must know that I have decided to give her an aid and a                     good loaf of bread every week. We win evil through good.\"                          Lawyer  Giovanni  Parisi,  the  already  quoted  employee  at  the  post  office  of                     Messina, told me another episode. \"A mailman had been dismissed because he                     had unduly opened letters and stolen","money to the prejudice of Canon Di Francia. A few days later, Dr.  Furci, the                     country director of the post office, made the mailman reassumed  and his case                     destroyed. At Parisi's marvel, he said, 'I cannot help. Yesterday Father Francia                     came over and knelt pleading the cause of that man and his family by saying, -I                     forgave him. You too must forgive.- He was determined to get up on condition                     that I hear his plea. Could I deny Father Francia'?\"                          Reports Father Vitale, \"After a sacrilegious robbery in our church, he did not                     worry  about  searching  for  the  thief;  instead  he  ordered  prayers  in  our                     communities for the sinner's conversion\" (Ibid. page 334).                          Canon Celona remembers that when the chapter debated whether to change                     the  schedule  for  the  Lent  preaching  in  the  cathedral,  the  Father  was  treated                     uncharitably by a capitular, but he did not react.                          The  pressures  from  the  poor  were  a  continuous  practice  of  patience  and                     meekness.                          \"Everyone paid respect to him, except some poor who inveighed against their                     benefactor  because  their  pretensions  were  not  satisfied  in  full.\"  He  was  so                     charitable toward the poor as to tolerate and be more generous with them, when                     they abused. If one of them treated the Father badly, the Father had him silent by                     increasing alms. \"The poor who offended him were given more generous alms                     because of the gospel's saying, 'Render good to those who do evil to you'.\"  He                     suffered the insults and even the threats of armed poor with extreme resignation.                     I remember specifically Julius Finocchiaro, a cobbler, who was never satisfied by         732                     the  ordinary  alms  from  the  Father.  \"One  day,  an  old  man  who  felt  himself                     deprived of his right to the soup insulted and pelted the Father with stones. A                     gentleman  happened  to  pass  by  and  rebuked  the  old  man  saying  that  Father                     Francia should be respected. But the Servant of God began whispering to him,                     \"Let it ride, I deserve more than this for my sins!\"                          The Father was beaten twice in Naples. An old man related to Father Carmelo                     that the Servant of God received a blow in his face from an unknown man out of                     hatred for the clergy. As a matter of fact, they did not know each other. But the                     Servant of God told the man, \"May God forgives you!\" Father Redento narrated                     that when the Father took him from the streets of","Naples, (he was a scugnizzo), two hoodlums insulted the Father and one of them                     slapped  him.  The  Father  reacted,  \"What  have  you  done,  son?  One  must  not                     behave so with a priest.\" The Father put into practice his own teaching. Writes                     Father Vitale, \"He always repeated to us the exhortation of our Lord, 'Learn from                     me because I am meek and humble of heart'  (Mt. ll, 29). He wanted all of us to                     be  tender hearted even when we had to admonish and correct.                           \"A superior was giving orders with a domineering voice; she was told:  'Sister,                     I never give orders to the sisters'; instead I say: 'Would  you mind doing this?'                     Please be so good as to do...' Because of this gentleness, any action against this                     virtue was forbidden. For instance, he once said about killing a chicken: 'That                     can  be  done  by  the  gardener.  Let  the  people  do  such  things'\"  (Father  Mary                     Hannibal Di Francia, page 327).                           We  move  from  chicken  to  sparrows.  It  is  worthy  remembering  an  episode                     narrated by Father Carmelo. Snow had fallen abundantly in Oria. From behind                     the window the Servant of God was observing a flight of sparrows in search of                     birdseed on the white sheet of snow. Thinking of them as creatures of God, he                     told  someone  to  bring  some  crumbs  to  feed  them.  Father  Carmelo  brought  an                     abundant  provision.  The  Father,  however,  was  displeased  because  the  grains                     went deep into the snow. We had to find a table, and the sparrows feasted on it...                          Now we move from sparrows to doves. The Father told the sisters of Padua to          733                     visit the saint at the basilica once a week, and to bring food to the doves which                     are on the square. Furthermore, he dictated a prayer that the sisters had to say on                     that occasion in order to become doves of purity and simplicity.                          Notes                              l.

Foundation of the spiritual life                              Our divine Redeemer told the apostles,  \"When you have done all you have                     been commanded to do, say, 'We are useless servants. We have done no more                     than  our  duty'\"  (Lk.  l7,  l0).    Through  these  words  Jesus  Christ  made  us                     understand  the  foundation  of  Christian  perfection,  i.e.,  the  knowledge  of                     ourselves and the confession that we are nothing (Vol. l0, page l5). The Father                     began a Marian preaching in l877 by expounding this sovereign doctrine of the                     divine teacher, which he repeated and recommended to us as the foundation of                     the religious life.                          We   must   clear this thought in order to avoid   any contradiction between it                     and  the  Father's  previous  statement  that  mortification  is  the  foundation  of                     perfection (Ch. 22, no. l).                          More than a single virtue, mortification is a combination of virtues, and the                     first step to all virtues\" (Tanquerey, Compendio di  teologia  ascetica,  etc.  no.                     754).  Not only the area of mortification is wider than the area of humility, but it                     also  exerts  influence  on  humility.    Mortification  is  a  habit  of  the  will,  which                     drives  the  people  to  mortify  selfishness  and  directs  the  spiritual  and  bodily                     pleasures to the glory of God\"  (De Guibert, Theologia spiritualis, etc. no. 350).                     Humility instead is the virtuewhich makes us know and love our littleness, upon           736                     which the mercy and love of God work wonders.  It is the negative foundation of                     the  supernatural  life  since  it  eliminates  the  obstacles  which  hinder  grace.                     Scripture says,\"God resists the proud, but bestows his favor on the lowly\" (Jas. 4,                     6).","2. From his writings                              From  the  Father's  writings  upon  humility  we  quote  the  following  one                     regarding the practice of this virtue.                          \"The sacred writers hold humility as the foundation of the spiritual building.                     Saint Augustine teaches, 'If you want to build a spiritual skyscraper, take care                     that the base of humility be profound.'  The more a person is holy, the more he is                     humble. Nothing hinders so much the sanctification of the people and their union                     with God as pride...  Therefore, let us hold humility in great esteem.                          Humility must be internal and external.                          Internal  humility  requires  that  we  form  the  poorest  opinion  of  ourselves,                     fighting  selfishness  and  our  own  disorderly  esteem.  Let  us  acknowledge  our                     nothingness, and consider ourselves worthy of punishments and eternal reproof.                     By seizing any occasion to humble ourselves, we have acknowledged that we are                     not humble enough.                          External humility requires that we humble ourselves in words and actions. We                     should  never  boast  of  our  actions  and  things,  nor  should  we  seek  our  glory,                     esteem, and praise.  When someone reprimands us for our faults, we must not                     excuse ourselves.  On the contrary, we must apologize and assent with humility                     of heart both to the reprehension and the punishment. If the superior sees any            737                     fault in us, we have to conform our opinion to his, even when we think of being                     faultless.    Or  better  yet,  in  this  case  we  are  to  humble  ourselves  twice:    first,                     because of the fault, and second, because we are unable to see it. By necessity,                     we can explain our reason with humility and low voice, but will keep silent as                     soon as our reason is dismissed.                          Humility in the works requires that we love a humble and poor state.  God                     forbid that anyone of us will wish honor, prominence, and dignity. It would be                     the sign that the building of the spiritual life is tottering! The practice of holy                     humility  also  requires  the  reparation  of  our  faults  in  discipline  by  humbly                     begging forgiveness and penance.  If we have set bad example and are told to                     remedy the prejudice to others, we have to do so willingly, before rendering the                     account to the tribunal of God.  Therefore, none will receive Holy Communion                     before  remedying  his  faults,  because  he  wouldn't  receive  any  benefit.  Should                     anyone","offend  a  brother,    he  will  beg    pardon    from    him  before    approaching  the                     Eucharistic table\" (S.C.  Vol.  l0,  page l92).                         3. Starter, not founder                              The state of life the Father chose would be enough to make us have an exact                     idea of his humility.  Since he renounced the benefits of his noble condition and                     his natural gifts, and decided to live in the midst of the poor as one of them, he                     had to face the judgments of the many who held him crazy. To feed his orphans,                     he begged from door to door in the city for over 20 years, and sometimes went                     on the ships to have the pots filled with soup.  If that is not heroic humility, what                     does it mean to be humble?                          Discussing about the Father's humility, we begin with his own funeral oration.                     It turned out to be his last solemn document of humility. He wrote:                           \"I beg my survivors in all the houses, specifically the superiors, not to praise                     me after my death because in such cases overstatements are made that, in my               738                     opinion, instead of relieving the soul, make it suffer. They make the soul suffer                     because it did not get the perfection, or the works, or those virtues that they have                     attributed to him\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 240).                           Even though the Father acknowledges that he had been endowed with good                     qualities  and  a  few  merits,  still  he  charges  himself  with  deficiencies  and                     imperfection,  as  we  have  remarked  here  and  there,  and  will  do  when                     circumstances require so.                          He  complains  for  the  gaps  in  his  culture.    He  says,    \"At  the  seminary  he                     studied  hastily  and  superficially\"  (S.C.  Vol.  7,  page  240).    He  attended  the                     courses of his time.  Father Vitale says that the seminary in the Father's time was                     different from ours, because of the political movements. The chair of morals was                     held by Ardoino, dogma by Filocamo, philosophy by Catara Lettieri, and letters                     by Bisazza.  These were the teachers of his literary and","sacred culture...  As soon as our Founder took the cassock, and certainly when he                     became a deacon, he turned out to be the most requested preacher in the city and                     the villages.  When I was ordained a priest, he told me, \"Avoid preaching for five                     years, and apply yourself to study.  Thus, you will avoid what happened to me:  I                     ruined my health and the maturity of the study.\"  But, his writings prove that the                     Father was a teacher of asceticism. This was the science he needed to direct his                     communities. However, he always sought to fill the gaps and implored the Lord                     to achieve this goal. We call to mind his prayer to achieve ecclesiastical science                     (ch. 2, no. 7).                          When the Father tried to convert learned people, by humility he asked Father                     Vitale to be a companion, because he thought he was not up to the debate by                     himself. So he thought.                          With regard to the institution, being the founder is the first merit of the Father;                     but he does not acknowledge such a merit. He wrote:                           \"From now on, the people must know that the true, effective, and immediate                     founder of this pious institute is Jesus in the Holy Sacrament (Vol.  l,  page  96,                     cf.  ch.  9,no.  l). The Eucharistic Heart of Jesus is the absolute, effective, and                     immediate  superior,  and  Immaculate  Mary  the  absolute,  effective,  immediate                     superior, as well as the guide and the teacher\" (S.C. Vol. 9, page 26, 29).                           He considered himself as the \"very unworthy vicar.\"  He said that he was not         739                     the founder of the institutes; the Lord would send the real one.  Once, a sister                     addressed a letter to him with these words:  Father sfondatore, whose meaning is                     the opposite of founder.  The Father immediately showed the address saying that                     the good sister had guessed right.  \"The Servant of God never wanted to be called                     founder, but starter.  The founder was the Heart of Jesus, and the superior, Our                     Lady.  He  signed:  the  priest  starter.\"  \"He  didn't  call  himself  the  founder,  but                     'sfondatore'.\" \"I heard him saying, 'Please don't call me founder, but 'sfondatore';                     who knows whether my works ruin the work of God'!\" (U. l2, 39).                          The  following  incident  is  gracious.  One  year  the  community  of  Trani                     celebrated  the  Father's  name's  day,  and  children  sang  a  hymn  with  the  refrain                     which ended with, \"Long live the founder!\" As soon as the Father heard it, he                     extemporized  some  verses  against himself,  singled out the best singer,  and                     made her sing them on the stage.  Unaware of the meaning, the little girl sang                     them with enthusiasm.  Despite the unwilling sisters, the Father  made the girl                     sing it up to the end.","Instead of parading his merit through the institution, he took advantage of the                     institution to proclaim his inability. Writing to the mayor of Oria he said,  \"The                     institute is an enterprise above the feeble strength of a man with scanty spirit and                     wits, as I am\" (Vol. 4l, page 48). Another time, speaking of ideals, aspirations,                     wishes, and hopes for the institution, he added,  \"In the moments of depression, I                     incline to qualify them illusions of my imagination\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page 2l2).                         4. Only to God honor and glory                              The Father expounded his thought about human cooperation in the works of                     God with an article in Heroine of Mansfeld.  It is a special issue published by the                     Geltrudine of Naples, in l9l4.                          After hinting at the troubles which hinder an institution at its beginning, the                     Father assures:                            The    virtues  which sooner or  later triumph are the following: \"constance,                     pure and tender love for human beings, spirit of sacrifice, the faith in God (in          740                     whose  hand  man  is  an  instrument),  holy  ideal,  continuous  activity,  and                     immolation of oneself.  But, woe to the people who take possession of an atom of                     such good! It is not  man who plants,  saves, and nurtures the tree by the long                     boughs, but God! Therefore, only to Him honor and glory!\"                           What about the little institutions?                           Whoever  received  one  talent,  will  work  with  that  one,  humbling  himself                     before the heroes of Christianity who received 5,000 talents and coped with them                     so well! As to us, we'll say, \"Thank you, Lord, for the talent and the grace you                     benigned to give us in order to cope with it.\"   People often say, \"That institution                     cannot continue because of the person who undertook it.  He is unable, nor up to                     it.\"  Be careful. Isn't it true that God chooses the feeble things of the world and                     the despised ones, and those that are nothing?  Only to God honor and glory!                     The critics   fall into another error when they compare a new institution with","the ones founded by the heroes of  Christianity, the  saints.   They say to the                     undertakers of a charitable institution,   \"How do you dare to imitate Blessed Don                     Bosco,  or  Blessed  Paola  Frassinetti,  Saint  Vincent  de  Paul,  Saint  Jerome                     Emiliani,  Blessed  Cottolengo,  and  the  like?  Please  stop.  You  are  not  an                     extraordinary man, nor a heroine.\"  By saying so, they make a big mistake. It is                     God who plants the institutions, and he chooses either saints, or poor men, or                     poor women. These are not up to the saints, nor to their wonders.  To follow the                     holy impulse of doing some good on earth, without pretending to do wonders like                     the saints, is enough for a founder. God accepts and blesses him/her!  We have                     charitable institutions all over the world, such as orphanages, asylums, and the                     like,  whose  founders  were  merely  good  Christians.    And  yet,  their  works  are                     from God! God performed them, in spite of human and hellish oppositions.                          Who was Tata John in Rome?  A poor layman, who felt compassion for the                     street-urchins,  began  gathering  them  around  himself,  and  began  building  the                     ample institute that the Popes protect.  That was the beginning of his institute                     (S.C.  Vol.  l, page 84).                        5. Showy flowers and meadow-flowerets                                                                                                                741                          We  know  how  humble  and  humanly  insignificant  were  the  origins  of  our                     institution.                          The Father informs Father Cusmano:                          \"I find myself in the beginning of some foundations without almost knowing                     the how.  It seems to me that God wants so.  He chooses the least things.\" The                     Father  acknowledges  that  the  Avignone  institution  is  \"really  beautiful  and                     sublime\"; the only false note is him. \"The great inconvenience is the lack of a                     holy man who may push it forth.\" For this reason he prays to the Sacred Heart                     that he deign to provide this institution with an apostolic man, and repeats the                     words Moses said before the burning bush: \"If you please, Lord, send someone                     else!\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 33).                          The Father repeats his wish several times while writing.  At the end of the                     rules for the novices, he writes:                           The good Jesus may bless and sanctify these my daughters, and send to them                     a spiritual, holy master of the spirit who will edify them with","good examples, leading them to holiness. I am not up to that (Vol. 2, page 42).                     My  daughters,  pray  to  the  most  holy  Heart  of  Jesus  to  send  a  holy  master,                     because things go wrong with me. Be always zealous for the salvation of souls.                     Let us present ourselves to the Lord humble, but trustful in his kindness. We are                     nothing, nevertheless we hope in his mercy (Vol. 34, page 6).  Pray to God that                     He will provide you and the Pious Institution with a man of the Lord (S.C. Vol.                     5, page 9).                           He was always in expectation FOR the holy man, and asked God for him in                     his prayers, urging his coming. In l9l4, at the end of a letter to Father Palma, he                     wrote this foot-note, \"Pray that the work of the Rogate may have the boss! (S.C.                     Vol.  7,  page  70).  And  to  Father  Vitale  in  l9l6,    \"The  Lord  makes  me  see  so                     clearly my nothingness and the wrong I have done that I wish my departure from                     earth.  May the Lord send his elect! Let us hope and pray!\" (Vol.  3l, page 75).                     He could not accept believing that the elect was himself!                          \"Humble  as  he  was,  he  confined  himself  to  resort  to  other  congregations,                     asking  them  to  take  over  his  work.    Only  after  they  refused,  he  thought  of                     founding  the  two  orders.\"  Says  Father  Vitale,    \"He  told  me,  'Canon,  do  not                     believe that we are thinking of doing great things like the Salesians.' As a matter                     of fact, at the entrance of Avignone Quarter the Father had written in big letters:                     'Be not afraid, little flock'!\"                          At the renovation of the vows he said:                                               742                           What do we pretend with this annual liturgy?  Are we wishing to become a                     great religious order in the Church like the orders by the saints, or the religious                     congregations that stretch out their branches like marvelous trees, giving shelter                     to the birds, as in Nebuchadnezzar's dream?  Not at all. We must get rid of any                     ambition, even of spiritual one. The only thing we wish, is to do God's will and                     to achieve the last end of our existence, the best we can... We should remember                     that the Church is a vast field with various plants:  trees, showy flowers, plants                     growing profusely, and meadow-flowerets.  Are they useless? Doesn't the owner                     of  the  field  like  them?  Yes,  he  does,  because  they  are  an  ornament.  But,  the                     consideration  of  the  principle  of  humility  must  lead  to  the  formation  of  a                     religious  community,  without  hindering  the  common  life's  aim,  which  is  our                     sanctification... Dearest sons, the Lord wants it!  He wants us to look after our                     sanctification and to form this least institution for the consolation of the Lord, for                     his glory, and the salvation of souls.  In","other words,  we must favor  the  aims  of the institute according to the will  of                     the Lord. That's all (S.C. Vol. 6, pages 93, 94).                           The  Father  seized  any  occasion  to  abate  his  merits  as  a  founder  of  the                     institute.                          From the beginning of his mission he greatly counted on the prayers of the                     Morning Star Sisters of Naples.  One of them, Sister Lucy of the Sacred Heart, a                     soul  full  of  supernatural  gifts,  wrote  to  him:  \"The  Lord  Jesus  will  form  this                     institution, but it takes time.  Me and others who are the founders, we'll see the                     completing of it from heaven.\" The Father comments with true satisfaction:                           O mysteries of the Lord! I strove believing that I was founding an institution,                     but  my  useless  efforts  were  coming  to  nothing  without  this  puissant  help!  I                     thought  of  becoming  the  founder  through  my  know  how.    An  inspired  virgin                     instead let me know that her zeal, prayers, offering, and tender entreaties to the                     Heart  of  Jesus,  gave  herself  and  the  other  sacred  virgins  the  right  to  call                     themselves founders (Vol. 45, page l38).                           Founders  and  co-founders  were  originated  from  the  Father's  humility.  He                     writes to Mother Anthony Lalia:                           The more the institution appeared beautiful, the more people and hell opposed        743                     it.  Perhaps, it was even tested by God who permitted so painful events.  A very                     important reason why he institution has been through all these events, is lack of a                     founder! On one hand, I am somehow the starter of the foundation, but on the                     other hand my work was fitting for destroying more than for edifying it! If I did                     not  succeed  in  destroying,  it  is  because  the  institution  belongs  to  God,  who                     prevented me from destroying it! Since my miseries and sins continue hindering                     the institution, an idea has crossed my mind during the mass, a few days ago.  I                     have to invite the people who love Jesus and the interest of his divine Heart to                     spiritually support the formation of these works.  They have to do so with Jesus                     and the most holy Virgin, who are the founders, and Saint Joseph, who is the co-                     founder. These people will be called the spiritual co-founders of Jesus, Mary, and                     Joseph\" (Vol. 38, page 8). Their task consists in offering prayer and sacrifices to                     the  Lord  for  the  formation  of  these  institutions  which  are  entrusted  with  the                     divine Rogate.","6. The bungler                              The  Father  charges  himself  with  the  difficulties  the  institution  has  faced.                     \"The  main  reason  of  the  tardy  development  and  the  combination  of  so  many                     painful events has been lack of a founder\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page l56).                          Despite  his  endless  charity,  the  Father  complained  that  he  afflicted  many                     people. We read in his funeral oration:                           \"The  late  canon  wants  people  to  know  that  during  his  life  he  made  many                     people suffer and many hearts grieve; therefore, he begs God and you to pardon                     his bad example and the grief he caused to any person\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 24l).                           He writes to Father Palma:                           I realize that I did nothing, but ruining everything.  My life   has been a chain                     of  mistakes,  errors,  oversights,  inexperience,  temerity,  and  what  is  worse,  bad                     examples.  But calling other people to suffer with me grieves me most! \"I toiled                     in vain and for nothing, uselessly spent my strength\" (Is.  49,4).  Please implore                     from the Heart of Jesus hope, trust, courage, and patience, because I need them                     very much! If I experienced them, I would feel strong and safe (Vol. 30, page 2l).        744                           To remedy these presumed faults, he said 33 masses for the people he had                     made suffer, etc.\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page 88).                          Writing  to  the  Father,  Canon  Vitale  called  himself  a  bungler.    The  Father                     responded, \"Please avoid speaking of bungler and not bungler... I am the bungler                     of this institution, from the beginning; but our Lord sent Canon Vitale to remedy                     the grave mistakes I had heaped up...\" (Vol. 33, page 99).                          When the sisters of Saint Benedict of Oria were granted to set the sacramental                     oratory, they made a Eucharistic feast, in the absence of the Father.  He wrote to                     Bishop Di Tommaso, \"I received from the Lord the privation of being absent, but                     I have understood better what I am experiencing from many years, i.e.,","that the communities do better and progress when I am absent. God lets me see                     how useless I am\" (Vol.  29, pages 7l, 2). Congratulating Father Vitale on the                     happy results of some affairs, the Father wrote,  \"I always say to myself,  'When I                     am out, things go better, and several difficulties disappear'\" (Vol. 3l, page 40).                     \"Saint Anthony grants you the miracles that he denies to me.  I do not deserve                     them.  Praised be God and Mary! (Vol.  32, page 42).  \"Praised be God! You                     succeed in what I wouldn't and couldn't\" (Vol.  33,page l5).  With regard to some                     inconveniences caused by people who kept silent when they shouldn't, he writes,                     \"Mute  devil!  It  is  over  forty  years  that  I  am  battling  him.  He  causes  grave                     damages  to  our  institutes,  but  I  have  not  succeeded  in  getting  him  out.    The                     gospel says that the person willing to drive away the one staying in the courtyard                     and  to  deprive  him  of  the  weapons  must  be  stronger!  And  I  am  not.  For  this                     reason, for over forty years I have seen him taking possession even of the elect in                     our houses\" (Vol. 32, page l26).                          The Father writes to the superior general of the Bocconiste that he entrusts our                     institute  to her founder.  \"I  managed it so badly, but  was  unable to destroy  it                     because our Lord Jesus protected it against my inexpertness\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page                     229). To save the institution from the abyss in which he had thrown it down with                     his  temerity,  the  Father  says  to  the  Lord,  \"The  means  are  failing,  and  my                     temerities fall down on my head! The work of my presumption, temerity, pride,                     ambition, and caprice is before me like an abyss, which      I cannot fill! I have                     dug abysses of miseries for my neighbor, I have deceived, and deceptions fall             745                     down on my head! My Lord, have mercy on me! Have mercy on all these people.                     My Lord, save, save this institution!\" (Vol.  4, page 72).                          The Father is convinced that his presence attracts the punishments of the Lord                     on the institution.  In the first months of l9l5, foreseeing the entry of Italy into the                     war,  he  writes  from  Apulia  to  Father  Vitale,  \"If  complications  set  in,  where                     should I stay?  Also Oria is important, even though I fear that where I am, there                     we expect more slaps...\"But he combines humility with confidence.  \"We have                     the Heart of Jesus who stretches out his hands to protect us\" (Vol. 3l, page 59).                          In  an  evening  during  his  last  disease,  the  Father  spoke  about  the  Lord's                     mercies on our institution. I witnessed to a new proof of his humility. He said:                           What  is  this  foundation  in  God's  mind?    I  imagine  it  like  a  great  adorned                     palace, with courtyards and halls; or like an immense garden","with parks,  villas, and houses. How much good can be done here! How many                     souls can be saved! How much glory and consolation it can bring to the Sacred                     Heart! Would it be the same foundation if God had chosen another person to start                     it, or if he had found more loyalty in me?  My sins have reduced it to a poor plant                     having a life of drudgery... in the misery of Avignone Quarter!                           This  spirit  of  humility  should  be  always  at  the  head  of  the  institution's                     progress.                           When the vocations grow in number and the youth are well formed, they will                     be ready for new foundations, avoiding to wish them for ambition, levity, vanity,                     and vainglory, which would prevent the Lord from blessing them.                          ...They will work in the holy Church and in the mystical harvest of God for                     the divine glory, for the consolation of the most holy Heart of Jesus, and for the                     salvation of souls (Vol. l, page l82). We repeat: we must avoid seeking to found                     any house by ambition, seeking big cities for a worldly reputation or for large                     profits; on the contrary, we must work for our Lord Jesus Christ's glory and for                     the poor who are not cared for by other institutions (Ibid. page l84).                        7. Humility, outcome of prayer                                                            746                            The  Father's  humility  was  the  outcome  of  prayer.    He  never  grew  weary  of                     asking the Lord for this virtue.  Perhaps there is no supplication in which the                     Father  forgot  to  implore  humility.  However,  all  his  prayers  are  inspired  with                     feelings  of  sincere  humility,  which  made  the  Father  annihilated  in  the  divine                     presence.                          A significant episode.  Soon after the first world war, the faithful of Italy said                     a prayer before the Blessed Sacrament to impetrate victory to Poland, which was                     attacked by Russia. As soon as the Father began the prayer (he always said all                     them), he gave the paper to the assistant cleric and kept silent.  One evening","he explained to Father Vitale,  \"What sort of prayer  is that  one?  I feel unable to                     say it! We should tell the Lord to remember the merits of that nation... Not at all.                     We should first humble ourselves in the prayer... The just charges himself at the                     beginning of the speech!\"                          The Father expatiates on speaking about how humbly we have to present our                     petitions to God, \"Happy the person who puts himself in the divine presence and                     prays with a treasure of humility in his heart! How many graces he will obtain                     for himself and others!\" (Vol. l, page 65).                          The Father noticed the spirit of prayer of Father Cusmano when that Servant                     of God preached in Avignone.                           When he described the annihilation of the soul before God, which   makes the                     prayer pierce heaven, he himself seemed annihilated before the Most High. Or                     better  yet,  he  looked  like  reproducing  the  profound,  intimate  humility  and  the                     perfect  loving  trust  with  which  he  used  to  annihilate  himself.  He  showed  the                     feeling of his nothingness before the divine presence. Thus, he cast his heart to                     Jesus with the fervor, which snatched out plenty of graces from the Heart of the                     divine Redeemer (S.C. Vol. 9, page l45).                           Unaware, the Father described himself.                          We  refer  to  chapter  one,  and  to  the  several  prayers  of  the  Father  for  his                     conversion. His petition on October 2, l888, starts from the life of Saint Dominic,       747                     and praises the Lord for having been humbled and defeated. It reveals enough the                     spirit of the Father.                           My Lord Jesus Christ, I thank, praise, and bless you for your infinite kindness,                     charity,  and  gentle  liberality  through  which  you  granted  your  beloved  Servant                     Dominic  everything  he  asked.  I  thank,  praise,  and  bless  you  for  your  perfect                     justice and impenetrable disposition, through which you deny me what I ask you                     with wails and sighs.  My sovereign Lord, I acknowledge your infinite wisdom                     and the admirable dispositions of your divine will.                          For  this  reason  you  are  endlessly  worthy  of  praise  and  blessing.    O  Most                     High, you covered me with humiliation and ignominy; defeated and placed me                     before my iniquities; left my prayer out of your presence; closed my ways with                     square stones, and left me in the hands of my foolish counsel. Most High, I kiss                     the  most  holy  rod  that  beats  me,  annihilating  myself  before  you,  my  true  and                     sovereign owner. As a","poorest slave, I am at disposal of your divine will. Do what you want with this                     worm! Amen! (S.C. Vol. l0, page 6).                           If the prayers of the Father are not granted, he charges himself with failure.                     For instance, when Father Vitale was expecting graces for his spirit, the Father                     wrote that he had visited some shrines in Rome, Naples, and Pompei. Then, he                     added,  \"Everywhere  I  implore  peace,  health,  and  sanctification  from  the  most                     holy Heart of Jesus and the sweetest mother Mary. If you get nothing, the blame                     is on me.  But let us always hope.  Always!\" (Vol. 3l, page 4l).                          To  amend,  the  Father  notes  his  defects  with  precision  during  his  spiritual                     retreats (see ch.   l). In l887, he happened to have a picture of the child Jesus                     squatted  near  a  wounded  donkey  lying  on  the  ground.  The  child  is  leaning  a                     caressing hand on the donkey's neck, and holds a cross with the other one.(l)  The                     Father sees himself in the wounded donkey, and writes this prayer on the back of                     the picture:                           O  Jesus,  Good  Shepherd,  have  mercy  on  your  little  donkey!  See  how                     wounded and languishing it is.  Feed it with your fat pastures, and water it at                     your clear springs! O Jesus, Good Shepherd, ride and excite it with the power                     and the sweetness of your word, making it walk your ways and carry you where                     you  want.  Under  the  government  of  your  merciful  hand,  render  it  obedient  to                     your  will!  O  Jesus,  Good  Shepherd,  if  your  donkey  is  unwilling  to  surrender   748                     perfectly to your signs, beat it with your holy cross, and make it perfectly docile.                     See to it that the little donkey acknowledge you as the only owner and serve you                     with patience, humility, and meekness. May it always carry you where you want!                     Amen (S.C. Vol. 8, page 6).                           One day he mailed the picture to Melanie, and acknowledged himself in the                     donkey. \"Please place the picture near the child Jesus, or under the beloved feet                     of my child Lord, who is in the oratory. He deigned to be my Good Shepherd\"                     (Ibid.).","8. \"The reproaches                             of my Lord to me,                             a wicked slave\"                                Msgr. Guarino loved the Servant of God so much, and one day told him                     playfully that he was like a horn. The Father held this word seriously, and wrote                     in  his  notes,  \"Msgr.  Guarino,  Archbishop  of  Messina,  defined  me  wisely  in                     August l887, 'You are like a horn: empty, hard, and sharp'.\" Then he commented,                     \"I am empty of virtue, sense, vigor, spirit, knowledge, science, etc. I am hard,                     because  I  am  obstinate,  hard-headed,  insensible  to  the  grace  and  call  of  God;                     hard-hearted with my neighbor, etc. If I am beaten, I do not soften, etc.  I am                     sharp,  because  I  am  punctilious.    I  prick  my  neighbor  with  my  tongue  and                     actions, offend, hit, wound, and kill.\" He concludes with this prayer, \"My Lord                     Jesus Christ, change me into a chosen vessel, full of your mercy, strong enough                     to keep the treasure of your grace, and steadfast. Amen\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page 6).                          We  read  in  the  gospel  how  our  Lord  lashes  his  enemies  for  their  pride,                     repeating tremendously,   \"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you frauds!\" (Mt.                     23, l3-l5). The Father fits those diatribes to himself, giving a splendid example of                     humility.                                                                                 749                                              THE REPROACHES OF MY LORD                            The  reproaches  of  my  Lord  upon  me,  a  wicked  slave!  ...    Woe  to  you                     hypocrite, who neglects seeking the kingdom of God for souls: you do not look                     after perfection, but impede others to get it, because of your defects!                          Woe to you hypocrite, who feed lavishly upon the alms of the poor, but are                     inattentive to prayer and canonical hours. You will give a more severe account!                          Woe  to  you  hypocrite,  who  travel  around  to  make  a  proselyte.  Then  you                     scandalize, making him like you!                          Woe to you, blind director who say, \"This is good, this is not.\"   Fool and                     blind, isn't your duty to know what is convenient, and what is","not? Whoever tries his best to know, but he does not succeed, he is not a sinner;                     whoever instead doesn't try his best, is at fault.                          Woe to you hypocrite, who gather orphans, give alms, say prayers, but neglect                     the  works  of  justice,  the  law,  the  priestly  ministry,  and  charity  with  your                     neighbor.    You  should  do  those  things  without  neglecting  these  ones.    Blind                     leader, who drip a midge, but gulp down a camel!                          Woe to  you hypocrite, who show  yourself a devotee,  but inside are full of                     robbery,  anger,  vanity,  misery,  pride,  negligence,  obstinacy,  selfishness,                     falsehood, and thousand of sins. Blind! First purify your inside, setting right your                     intentions; then show yourself a devotee.                          Woe to you hypocrite, who are like the whitewashed sepulchers, beautiful on                     the outside, but full of dead bones and dirty inside. You seem good to men, but                     inside are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.                          Woe to you, who build the walls of the orphanages and adorn the rooms of the                     orphans saying, \"If I had means, I wouldn't let perish plenty of children.\"  Thus,                     you  bear  witness  to  yourself,  who  act  worse  than  those  having  means,  letting                     souls perish.  if you have no means, you are the cause. You overflow the measure                     of those who don't try their best for the salvation of souls. Little serpent, viperish                     race, how do you escape the judgment of the fire?                          I send to you warnings, good books, inspirations, teachings, good occasions,                     but  you  don't  pay  attention  as  you  should.    You  are  indebted  to  the  grace  of                     conversion and to priesthood, being liable for your faults in the service of my           750                     people and my altar. I truly tell you:  you deserve the punishment for all these                     faults!                          Soul, soul, who are negligent in corresponding to my grace and service! How                     many times I tried to purify and draw you close to me as a chick under the wings                     of the chicken, but you held out against!  Behold!  Your soul will be left desert                     and empty of grace!  I tell you,   \"You won't see me again until you heartily say,                     \"Come, O Lord, because I converted to you!\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page 3l).                           In an ardent supplication to the most holy Bambinella Mary, on September 8,                     l905, he asks the most holy Mother to have her merits recognized before the most                     holy Trinity, in favor of the institutes:                           It  is  over  27  years  since  I  committed  myself  to  this  institution,  how  much                     moved by selfishness and false zeal!   Oh, difficulties which would be so little for                     the master spirits were for me hard, rough mountains for me! What is worse, I                     myself created harsh, grave difficulties to me and others! I would like to  shed  as                     many  bloody tears as  the  waters  of  the  ocean. Everything got","spoiled in my hand! Everything stopped because of me! Who will free me from                     want of persons, buildings, and means? This is the triple treasure I have heaped                     up!  Oh, if I had answered the divine graces! Oh, in what vile vessel the Most                     High deposited the great word of the divine zeal of his loving Heart! (Vol. 7,                     page 87).                           Moved  by  such  feelings,  we  do  not  wonder  at  the  following  words  of  his                     funeral oration:                           \"To tell the truth, the Pious Institution he started did not improve because of                     him! He tried four to five times to form the priestly Rogationist community and                     never  succeeded  because  he  lacked  something,  and  sometimes  he  himself                     destroyed it for false zeal\" (S.C.  Vol.  7, page 24l).                           For this reason  he  attributed to others the merit of the foundation. \"On the                     evening of June l3, l926, he had a speech in the church at the second vespers of                     the saint thaumaturge.  For the sake of truth, quoting the gospel's words \"the truth                     will  set  you  free\"  (John,  8,  32),  he  declared  that  both  the  works  and  the                     Anthonian movement shouldn't be attributed to him, but to God; and after God,                     to Father Palma for the economics, and to Father Vitale for the spiritual gifts. He                     repeated the same thought in a leading article of God and Neighbor of the same                     year. Besides, he had already qualified himself in words and writing, the starter.        751                     Because  Father  Vitale  succeeded  in  fostering  the  clerics,  \"the  Servant  of  God                     said smiling to them, 'You are Vitalini.' I am not up to such a work.\" \"The clerics                     were  called  Vitalini  because,  according  to  the  Father,  only  Father  Vitale  was                     entitled to the merit of their formation and of the fortunes of the congregation.\"                     On one occasion he wrote, \"The founder of the Rogationists is Father Vitale, on                     behalf of the Blessed Sacrament, the divine founder\" (Vol. 33, page 42).                          One  year,  on  the  name's  day  of  Father  Vitale,  one  year  the  Father  wrote  a                     hymn  to  Saint  Bonaventure,  imploring  the  protection  of  the  saint  upon  Father                     Vitale,  who  had  joined  the  \"falling  Hannibal\"  in  the  institution.  Father  Vitale                     replaced \"falling Hannibal\" with \"fervent Hannibal.\" But the Father sent back the                     paper qualifying himself in rhyme \"glutton, sluggard, jester, and the like, in such                     a way that the words stood out in the song!\"","9. Teaching...                              We can easily understand the role of humility in the Father's teaching.                          One day, while we were vivaciously playing, the Father happened to pass by                     and called, \"Children!\"  All of us ran to him... \"What virtue have we to practice                     more to please the Heart of Jesus?\" \"Humility, humility,\" we answered in chorus.                     \"Yes, children, just humility...\" He went away pleased. We had met his thought.                          \"The  word  humility  was  often  in  his  lips  to  admonish  us.\"  \"He  frequently                     exhorted  us  to  achieve  and  practice  this  virtue.\"  \"In  the  community  he  often                     spoke of this virtue to foster our interest in it.\"                          Reminding us of the evangelical parable, he recommended to always choose                     the  last  place.  When  he  was  afflicted  by  opposition  or  hitches,  he  humbled                     himself,  seeing  in  the  events  the  punishment  of  God  for  his  sins.  He  begged                     pardon, and surrendered to the infinite mercy of the Lord, trustfully.                          \"In  his  lectures,  he  often  told  us  that  the  Lord  delayed  the  progress  of  the                     institution because of his sins.  He took this idea as a motive for exhorting us to                     be humble like useless servants. \"When he noticed some pieces of carelessness in                     the  sisters,  he  wrote  to  the  mother  general,  \"I  hope  that  these  pieces  of                     carelessness  toward  me  and  other  persons  come  to  an  end  when  I  will  be  no                     longer. Such things happen for punishment of my sins\" (Vol.  36, page l6).  If he         752                     perceived feelings of pride in us, he became sad and rigorous.                          \"He  always  recommended  humility  to  us,  saying,  'among  the  religious                     communities, you are grass, i.e., empty of virtue'.\" \"He taught us that humility is                     the foundation of the virtues. The strutting of some probationers was a negative                     sign of vocation; therefore, he tried his best to make people humble also in the                     appearance.\"                          Listen to a Religious of ours. \"When I was a boy, I deserved","the  punishment of kneeling in the refectory because of a  little fault.  Then, by                     rule I went to beg pardon from the Servant of God, but I did not kneel before                     him.  To teach me how one should beg pardon, he admonished me solemnly and                     he himself knelt showing the way how to do it.\"                          He exhorts Father Vitale to insist on cultivating the virtue in the Religious,                     even at the risk of losing youths of talent. \"The matter of importance for us is to                     hold in esteem and to seek humility, and the love of Jesus, whatever they may be                     the brains we lose.  But, more than losing, we gain. We must never put our trust                     in creatures, because the humble, simple souls form the institution, not the brains,                     as you teach me\" (Vol. 32, page 45).                          When the Father began the seminary in the institute, he wrote this beautiful                     prayer for the youth:                           O most holy Virgin, you held yourself as the lowest among creatures, despite                     you were full of grace, and born without original sin.  Grant us perfect internal                     humility along with compunction of spirit and love for humiliations. By humility,                     you  drew  God  from  heaven  to  earth  in  your  purest  womb;  please  infuse  the                     precious habit of this great virtue in our heart!  We beg you for the sake of your                     humility,  which  made  you  the  Mother  of  God;  for  the  sake  of  your  divine                     motherhood,  which  came  about  for  your  humility;  and  for  the  sake  of  Jesus                     Christ your only Son, who loved and taught the virtue of holy humility.  Holy                     Mother, see the mission into which we are initiated, if divine clemency destines          753                     us to priesthood.  See to it that we prepare ourselves perfectly with the practice of                     internal and external humility. May we always acknowledge our nothingness and                     place ourselves in the last place, following the teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ!                     Amen (Vol. 7, page l9).                           When the religious community was better organized, the Father replaced this                     prayer with a daily Hail Mary to the most holy Virgin.                          When  a  religious  student  happened  to  scold  a  religious  brother,  the  Father                     intervened with an extemporary, long, and so tender exhortation to be humble                     that Father Franze' of the Friars Minor told me,  \"I got out more from it than a                     month of retreat!\"                          On one occasion the Father admonished the novices, and they accepted his                     words with virtue.  He was pleased, but insisted on humility:                           I      delighted      in  hearing  that  you  have  accepted  my  admonishment  with                     humility.    It  must  be  done  so,  without  thinking  whether  you  deserved  it.  You                     must say within  you, \"It is right. I deserve it.\" Humility pleases the Lord, but                     displeases the devil, who endeavors to convince people that","they  deserve no punishment. Blessed daughters, I exhort  you always to renew                     your spirit, rising from your faults, humbling yourselves, and taking again to the                     road of the virtues with courage.  I thank you for your wishes, but high seats are                     unfitting for me.  May the good Jesus keep me under his divine feet, under his                     celestial table! (Vol.34, page l).                           A youth who fancied to become a sister wrote to the Father. She said   she                     would  perform  great  things  as  a  member  of  the  community.  The  Father                     responded, \"My daughter, none is able to perform great things. On the contrary                     we should aspire to perform plenty of beautiful little things and make ourselves                     little. Great is only God, who is able to do great things\" (Vol. 42, page l36).                        10. ...And examples                              When  the  Father  did,  or  thought  of  having  done  something  rash  while                     punishing  or  correcting,  he  humbled  himself.  By  doing  so,  he  grew  in  our                     esteem. Says a witness, \"Once he told us that he had decided to dismiss a sister                     because of her faults. But after she acknowledged her faults in public, the Father        754                     forgave  her  and  said,  'I  am  wrong.'  Furthermore,  at  lunch  time  he  gave  the                     repentant sister the fish I had cooked for him.\" \"In cases of misunderstanding, he                     apologized with the sisters, and recommended to keep in mind the evangelical                     parable  about  humility.\"  Says  a  former  orphan  who  was  in  charge  of  the                     typography. \"Like a child, he had no ambition to stand out to the prejudice of                     others. I  myself at  the age of 22  reprimanded him  because he removed a  boy                     from a machine, running the risk of causing damage. As guilty on the spot, he                     apologized very humbly.\"  Says a sister, \"When we were in the garden, some                     boys threw stones at us, and a sister answered back with a stone.  I was accused                     with that, and the Father deprived me of Communion. As soon as he knew that I                     was guiltless, he knelt at my feet in the presence of","the community, asking forgiveness.\"                          In  Rome  he  met  a  monsignor  who  was  going  to  Padua  for  the  first  time,                     without reserving any place. The Father addressed him to Battizocco family, and                     gave a hundred liras for the expenses. On occasion, this monsignor could return                     the  favor  to  the  Father,  and  so  he  wrote  to  Father  Vitale,  \"He  may  help.\"                     However, soon after he thought over it and added, \"Certainly, Saint Vincent of                     Paul  and  Cottolengo  would  have  reprimanded  me  for  putting  my  trust  in  a                     creature, because of a hundred liras! But I am, 'I am not'!\" (Vol. 3l, page 40).                          His humility made him discover defects in his own virtues. We read in his                     funeral oration:                           \"VIRTUES - Certainly, we cannot speak of heroism here, and before God's                     inquisitive eyes, this man has been less than nothing.  We cannot deny that he                     had mercy on the poor, and many times he sympathized with them and tried to                     help them, even though we do not know if he went beyond his bounds because it                     was his duty to raise the sheltered orphans through the procuring of alms\" (S.C.                     Vol. 7, page 24l).                           In  l92l,  the  community  celebrated  the  seventieth  anniversary  of  the  Father                     with a performance.  At the end of it, the Father said, \"You have come here to                     honor me and to delight in my institutions; but I think that the Lord is not pleased                     by my work. From the priests he shall demand an explanation of the things they            755                     have omitted to do.\" Mr. Micalizzi, a creature of the institute, almost always used                     to recite some verses in Sicilian dialect, at the closing of the feast on July first.                     By  unfortunate  idea,  one  year  he  began  speaking  of  the  Father  and  his                     institutions.  He was immediately silenced.  That day was the feast of the Blessed                     Sacrament. That was the topic one should speak of.                          We have said several times that the Father helped the Morning Star Sisters in                     many  ways,  but  he  also  wrote  to  them,  \"Don't  hold  my  advices  as  infallible.                     Obey your superiors and do everything with the prayer; this is the surest way\"                     (Vol.  39, page 74).  When they thanked for his helping hand, he pointed out,                     \"You say that without my help  you wouldn't know how to do.  Ah,  you know                     better than I do that God is helping you.  God uses whomever he wants! Either                     the cock crows or it does not, God rises the sun! Certainly, I am obliged to God                     more than you, because he deigns to use me!\" (Vol.  39,  page l0). When their                     institute was struggling through difficulties and want, the Father quoted passages                     from the bible to excite their confidence in God. He wrote to the mother superior,                     \"Isn't it an evident miracle of","divine kindness toward your institute the fact that  a poor  priest burdened with                     fourteen communities send hundreds and thousands of liras to you in these hard                     times?  Therefore, trust in God!  As to us, let us thank the divine kindness that is                     pleased to help your holy institute through me, despite my demerits!\" (Vol. 39,                     page l4).                          His humility shines even when he asks for prayer.  He asks Melanie,   \"Pray                     so that the most holy Heart of Jesus be superabundantly atoned for the pains I                     have caused him\" (S.C. Vol. 8, page 3). On the occasion of a slight ailment, the                     Father writes to Father Vitale, \"Do not make people pray much for my healing,                     because the institute's affairs are of a greater importance and have precedence\"                     (Vol.  3l, page 30).  To the Morning Star Sisters:  \"Two doctors kept me under                     observation. They didn't find anything serious.  Therefore, do not strive praying                     for  me,  but  for  the  urgent  affairs  of  your  institute.  May  the  omnipotent  child                     Jesus make everything succeed according to his wishes\" (Vol.  39, page 36). On                     another occasion: \"As for my health, please do not strive praying.  Say one Hail                     Mary a day. That's enough.  You have to say so many prayers, you cannot tire                     yourselves therefore, above all the old ones\"  (Vol.  39, page 40).                          Owing to an abscess to a leg, the Father was compelled to stay in bed. He                     wrote to the pious Virginia of Aquila.                           You informed me that Father Ferretti has told you on my behalf to pray for                     me, because I am sick.  There must be a misunderstanding.  I told him to say              756                     some prayers, but not many for this trifle. Instead, you have to pray much for the                     interests  of  the  Heart  of  Jesus,  for  the  conversion  of  sinners,  and  my  own                     conversion; for numerous, holy priests to the holy Church, and holy rulers; for                     the propagation of faith, and other serious affairs (S.C. Vol. 5, page ll3).                           Even  when  the  Father  prepared  the  circular  about  his  own  death,  he  was                     moderate in asking prayer from the Sacred Allies of the institute.                           The undersigned Canon M. Hannibal Di Francia from Messina, passed into                     eternity  on...at...o'clock,  at  the  age  of...  Through  this  printed  paper  written  by                     himself, he announces the news of his death to the prelates of the holy Church...,                     to  the  venerable  convents,  friends,  acquaintances,  lords,  and  Rev.    Fathers  in                     order that they want to charitably dispose some suffrages for his poor soul...","He thanks very  humbly and promises to pray for those who will pray for his                     poor soul.  He does not demand that so many people spend excessive time on                     him  in  these  bad  times,  when  they  have  to  pray  more  profitably  for  the  main                     interests of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the holy Church, the salvation of the souls,                     and  everything  concerning  the  universal  triumph  of  divine  love  (S.C.  Vol.  7,                     page 239).                       11. \"Humility goes before honors\"                              We do not leave out an epoch-making episode to us.                          We quote a report:                           \"A learned person who did not agree with the Father upon a subject, in the                     ardor  of  the  discussion  labeled  him  with  injurious  epithets.  Even  though  the                     Father was not convinced by the contrary arguments, he not only faced the insult                     with  patient  silence,  but  also  retired  apologizing.    The  debate  was  about  the                     Messina  traditions  on  Saint  Anthony,  which  the  learned  person  denies  in  the                     biography of the Saint.\"                                                                                                               757                          After so many years, we can handle the subject more clearly.                          During  the  national  Eucharistic  congress  in  l924,  our  Founder  met  Father                     Vittorino  Facchinetti  of  the  Friars  Minor  (l8..-l950)  in  Palermo.  Author  of                     various  studies,  especially  upon  Franciscan  saints,  Father  Vittorino  was  later                     elected Apostolic Vicar of Tripolitania. He had published an abridged edition of                     Saint Anthony's life for the youth, condemning the Anthonian traditions of Sicily                     as tales unworthy remembering. Very sensitive to the religious traditions of the                     island, the Father wrote a letter to the author, insisting upon the value of those                     traditions, which cannot be erased by a stroke of pen.                          Father  Facchinetti  did  not  answer.  When  they  met  in  the  sacristy  of  a                     Franciscan church, the Father apologized thoughtfully for his letter, in case his                     interlocutor had found motives of offense. Father Facchinetti took up the subject                     immediately, and the Father opposed his arguments by saying, \"My Father, it is a                     mistake to deny a tradition because of lack of documents; it is a mistake to deny                     it without having positive proofs.\"                          We don't know the condition of spirit of Father Facchinetti in that moment.                     Helped by a fellow member of his order, who","qualified himself as the lector general,  he went out of  bounds saying,  \"Saint                     Anthony's  second coming to Sicily is false, is a lie, and you are in bad faith, you                     are a conceited dolt...\"                          These epithets blew out the Father's ardor in defending the cause.  He mildly                     said, \"Well, my Father, please recommend me to the Lord, pray for me in the                     holy mass...\" and was going out to avoid an indecorous debate in a holy place in                     the  midst  of  priests...  But  the  other  one  continued  insulting,  so  the  Father                     repeated, \"Recommend me to the Lord in the holy mass; recommend me to the                     Lord.\"  But the interlocutor insisted, \"Your criteria would make of you a good                     historian... I am going to publish a big life of Saint Anthony, and when I meet                     this subject, I will place a foot-note saying that Saint Anthony's second coming to                     Sicily can be admitted only by Canon Di Francia's odd brain...\"                          The  Father  took  his  leave,  recommended  himself  to  the  prayer  of  his                     interlocutor, and went away accompanied by new undeserved epithets.                          Then came true the Scripture's saying, \"Humility goes before honors\" (Prov.                     l5, 33). Father Galileo Venturini, S. J., one of the speakers in the clergy session,                     at  the  end  of  his  speech  at  the  national  Eucharistic  congress  in  Palermo,                     introduced  the  padre  to  the  audience  who  cheered  enthusiastically.    The...                     bishops... showed great satisfaction at seeing him in the meeting. Some of the                     clergy moved closer to hear him from nearby while others stood up on chairs.                          With his usual calm and with simple words vibrant from this great love for                     souls, the padre began speaking of the Rogate to which are joined the fortunes of         758                     the Eucharist.                          A few days later Facchinetti passed by our institute and asked of the Father.                     Did he wish to apologize?  The Father, however, was in Rome.  I met Facchinetti                     in Assisi,  in l948 or l949.  He was already a bishop. He said only, \"I have known                     Canon Di Francia: a holy man...\" No more, no less.(2)","12. More witnesses                              If we gathered what the people have said about the Father's humility, a long                     work  would  come  out.    We  make  a  choice  instead.  \"The  virtues  which  shone                     more  in  him  were  humility  and  charity  for  God  and  neighbor.\"  Spending                     joyously  good  part  of  his  life  in  the  midst  of  the  beggars  is  a  monument  of                     humility.  \"Averse  to  presumption,  he  avoided  any  circumstance  which  could                     make  people  believe  he  had  feelings  of  pride  and  ambition.\"  \"In  my  frequent                     relations with him I noticed that he was a humble person never seeking himself,                     but the glory of God.\"                          \"Humility shone in his behavior: it was delightful to approach him because of                     his suavities.\" \"Humility shone in his dress, walk, and his way of handling the                     people.\" \"He was very humble. Even common people perceived this virtue from                     his walk. He always used third class train, except in his last years, because he                     was compelled by his children's love. Toward the end of his life, to move about                     in Messina he used a calash pulled by a little donkey. It was like a symbol of his                     poverty and humility... For the sake of humility, he loved so much washing and                     kissing the feet of people, above all the male comers in his institute. He did so                     with  me  and  my  companions.  He  also  used  to  wait  on  at  refectory.  To  pay                     homage  to  Saint  Alphonsus,  he  volunteered  to  wait  on  the  Fathers  of  Via       759                     Merulana (in Rome), but he was denied.\" \"His humility was always hieratic, I                     ever saw it so.  To my knowledge, he never failed in such a virtue.\" \"Taking into                     consideration the nothingness of the human things, he held humility in profound                     esteem...\" \"One day I asked him,\" says Father Vitale,  \"whether he was a friend                     of His Excellence Blandini, the Bishop of Noto.\" \"A friend?  A Servant!   He                     responded.  After  outlining  the  Father's  humility,  Father  Vitale  concludes,                     \"However, never did he forget the duties of his office, the priestly dignity, and                     the splendors of worship.\"                          \"From his speaking and treating, the people noticed how humbly he thought                     of  himself.\"  \"The  Servant  of  God  shone  in  humility...  One  day  I  caught  him                     humbly bent in the chapel, confessing to a priest that I esteemed the last one in                     the city of Trani.\" \"On the Father's name's day, a sudden storm flooded his room                     in Trani. With simplicity, he took off his shoes and began drying up the floor                     with the clothes he had at disposal.","Then  he  let  others  help  him...  More  than  once  he  said  to  us,  above  all  in  his                     name's day, 'A worm was born, which became a beast. Pray for this sinner who                     was born on July 5. He hinted at himself.\"                          \"He excelled at humility by humbling himself with the superiors, his equals,                     and his subjects.\"  \"His customary way of asking was, 'Sister, (or brother), can                     you give, or do this, please?\" \"He accepted canonry by obedience, after refusing                     it several times. He wouldn't have resigned himself to wearing honorary insignia.                     He  thought  that  insignia  and  daily  shopping  for  the  Avignone  poor  were                     incompatible.\"  \"He delighted in bending before people lower than him. He often                     said in public, 'Lord, have mercy on me for the times I have offended you, even                     unwillingly!  Children, ask the Lord to hear me'!\" \"He had the gift of humility.  I                     saw him dealing with all classes of people, keeping the same attitude.\" \"On the                     eve  of  the  main  feasts,  he  ate  kneeling  in  the  refectory.  On  Holy  Thursday                     evening, he washed our feet, kissed them passionately, and had a moving speech                     for us.\"                          \"His admonitions were almost always about humility, and he practiced this                     virtue first...  When the act of penance in the month of May was about humility                     and mutual forgiveness, he was the first to beg pardon.\"                          \"He   cultivated humility profoundly, and when someone congratulated him                     upon his institutions, he responded quickly, 'Everything is due to God and my                     cooperators.'  One day he asked me for the scissors to have his hat's tufts cut.                     Because  I  was  amazed,  he  said  that  tufts  weren't  worth  wearing.\"  \"He  openly   760                     held  himself  as  a  useless  servant  in  the  hands  of  the  Lord.    His  humility                     appeared   from his attitude and   his   continuous confession, as well as from his                     warm exhortations to achieve this virtue.\"                          The Father's last visits at Taormina are well remembered. \"In the last visit but                     one, we gathered in the chapel. He wanted all of us present, and said, 'We won't                     see one another on earth any longer.  I humbly beg your pardon if I have not                     answered your expectations and my duties.'   At our hiccups, he changed tone                     and unusually let us kiss his hand.   When he mildly demanded the master not to                     rebuke the orphans for their pulling and  kissing his  hands,  he seemed Jesus                     repeating  'let the little  children come  to  me'  (Lk.  l8,  l6).  Some days later he                     came again","unexpectedly,   because  the  archbishop  refused  the  luxurious hospitality at                     Saint  Dominic  hotel.  Instead,  he  asked  to  dwell  in  our  house,  and  asked  the                     Father to accompany him in the pastoral visit to Taormina.  To the humiliation of                     the Servant of God who narrated the fact, the archbishop sat at the left of the                     Father  in  the  car,  out  of  politeness.    The  faithful  perceived  the  archbishop's                     esteem for our Founder's virtue, and rejoiced.  The archbishop dwelt six days; the                     Father, three. Those were days of martyrdom for him; he was crushed by grief.                     He asked me humbly, 'Do you think I should ask the archbishop to let me leave?'                     As a matter of fact, while saying mass he seemed to breathe his last on the altar.                     Also,  the  religious  brother  who  assisted  him  lovingly  had  not  come.    On  my                     urgent  demands,  or  else  I  myself  would  have  done  so,  the  Father  asked  the                     archbishop to let him leave. That was his last visit.\"                        13. An objection                             We conclude this chapter with an objection against the Father's humility.                          He  commissioned  Teresa  Basile  to  paint  a  picture  of  several  persons,  who                     would stand for Saint Margaret M.  Alacoque, Saint Francis of Sales, and the              761                     saint of Chantal.  While commissioning the piece of art and communicating the                     scheme to the artist, the Father specifies, “I would like to be part of the picture.                     You could paint a priest at the foot of the altar kneeling in adoration before the                     Holy Sacrament, between the Salesian Sisters and the Daughters of Divine Zeal.                     To  see  the  priest's  face  has  no  importance.  A  hint  of  his  profile  should  be                     enough\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page l26).                          Someone said that the Servant of God's humility did not shine in this case.                          And yet, it shone! We give further details.                          First,  the  Father  curtly  opposed  to  show  off  himself  in  any  circumstance.                     When  the  young  painter  Adolph  Romano  asked  him  insistently  to  pose  for  a                     portrait, because he liked to start his career   with the Servant of God, the Father                     told him, “Paint a","Portrait of Father Vitale.   He is better known and   more appreciated than I am in                     Messina.\" And he denied posing.                          Years before, he wrote to the painter Basile, \"I listened to hearsay from mine                     in Trani about a portrait of me, etc.  I beg you: do not meddle. I don't want any                     portrait. Not at all.\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page l25).                          I  add  that  the  Father  never  permitted  to  expose  any  of  his  pictures  in  our                     houses.                          Let us return to the painting by Basile.                          This isn't a worship painting, but a living room decoration. It is in Messina in                     the mother-house of the Daughters of Divine Zeal. The Father mailed a photo of                     the painting to all the houses saying to expose it in the community, not in the                     church, nor in the oratory\" (Vol. 34, page 227).                          The reason and the meaning are the following.                          For  long  years  the  Father  nurtured  the  dream  of  a  union  between  the                     Daughters of Divine Zeal and the Visitation Sisters by Saint Francis of Sales and                     Saint Jane Frances of Chantal.  He prayed so long to make his dream come true                     because of the revelation to Saint Jane and her apostolate for the Sacred Heart in                     the world through her order.  By so doing, the Father aimed at drawing a new                     protection and mercy from the Scared Heart upon the Daughters of Divine Zeal;                     as  well  as  at  calling  the  attention  of  the  Visitation  Sisters  upon  the  divine                     command to spread the prayer for good workers to the holy Church.                          The Father had this scheme exemplified in a painting, which shows the Holy           762                     Sacrament on the altar, whence the devotion to the Sacred Heart came forth, and                     where  all  devotions  converge\"  (Ibid.  page  225).  Immaculate  Mary,  Saint                     Margaret, (who holds a picture of the Sacred Heart with the Rogate), the saints                     founders Francis of Sales and Jane of Chantal are around the Blessed Sacrament.                     A group of Visitation Sisters is on one side, and a group of Daughters of Divine                     Zeal, on the other, whereas a priest is kneeling in adoration at the foot of the                     altar.                          Suppose that the Father had thought of showing himself at the foot of the altar                     to  meet  his  longing  for  staying  in  perennial  adoration  before  the  Blessed                     Sacrament. Would it be an act of pride?  We do not call Saint Teresa of the child                     Jesus a foppish because she delighted in mirroring herself in the paten, when she","was a sacristan.  By doing so, she thought that the consecrated host could almost                     rest on her face.                          But the matter went the other way round. People can think of whatever about                     the Father's desire when he commissioned the painting. The fact is that we see                     the priest in the picture from the rear -- perhaps for humility's sake.  Furthermore,                     the Father explains:                           \"At the foot of the altar also a priest is kneeling in adoration before the Holy                     Sacrament,  the  divine  Heart  of  Jesus,  and  Immaculate  Mary.  He  could  be  the                     Blessed Father De la Colombiere, an intimate cooperator of the Blessed Margaret                     for the spreading of the devotion to the adorable Heart.  But he may represent all                     the Rogationists, because he is praying to the most holy Heart of Jesus to send                     out good workers to the holy Church\" (Vol. 34, page 226. See Vol. 38, page l5).                        Notes                             (l)  The  Father  received  the  picture  from  the  Servant  of  God  Rosa  Gattorno,  the  founder  of  the                     Daughters of Saint Anna.  He kept it very dear.                                                                                                               763                          (2) In l925, Facchinetti published the big volume Anthony of Padua - The Saint - The Apostle - The                     Thaumaturge printed by S. Lega Eucaristica of Milan.  He treats the second coming of the saint to Sicily,                     but differently from the language he used with the Father.  \"It seems sure that Anthony returned (from                     France) to Italy by sea. He boarded the ship at Marseille. He was granted it for the sake of God by the                     captain who set sail for the Tyrrhenian sea.  Either the storm brought him again to Sicily, or he himself                     wished to  see again the  hospitable shores and the Religious of that province,  who received him  from                     Morocco, the tradition   makes him landing again on the island of the sun. Track of his short staying are a                     few  tardy  monuments  and  tales  of  the  wonders  he  worked\"  (page  3l7).      However,  Facchinetti                     acknowledges, \"The early hagiographers make the saint go directly from Province to Padua, which was to                     be the most fruitful field of his zeal.  But, this way, we find a gap of two years in the Anthonian history,                     i.e., l227 to l229\" (Ibid.).                          Are we able to think of Saint Anthony confined in any place without preaching the divine word, before                     reappearing at Padua out of the blue?  He, the saint, the apostle of fire? If we don't have any documents                     about  the  saint's  two  year  activity,  we  can  rightly  think  that  he  spent  this  time  in  Sicily,  instead  of                     speaking  of  a  short  staying  there.    Thus,  the  tradition  handing  down  that  the  saint  founded  several                     convents in the island remains vindicated.  Also, it","is commonly admitted  that  the ancient legends,  i.  e., the collection of the saint's stories, have been                     mutilated.  Viscardi writes about \"the terrible crisis in he order of the Friars Minor after the death of the                     patriarch. Both the Conventuals and the Zealots...  aimed at presenting Anthony as one of theirs, thinking                     that the authority of his name was of a great moment for legitimating opinions and doctrines.  They did so                     with firmness ... but without respecting chronology, sometimes\" (Viscardi, Saint Anthony of Padua - A.E.                     Formiggini,  Rome,  l93l,  page  l4).  Facchinetti  himself  calls  our  attention  to  \"the  internal  fights  that                     tormented the order in its first three centuries.\" During this time, the friars who were nicknamed \"the                     advocates of slackening,\" battled fiercely against the ancient manuscripts, the pure, candid, but very true                     biographical legends\"  (Page l6).  (See the wonderful  study  by Prof.  Salvatore Ribilotta:  La tradizione                     messinese nella storia di  S.  Antonio di Padova, published on God and Neighbor, July l933).                          Therefore, the Father had good grounds to firmly uphold the Anthonian traditions of Sicily.                                                                                                                              764","24                                                                                  RELIGIOUS                                                                                             VOWS                                           l.

Notes","1. On Saint Joseph’s feast                              We  have  already  pointed  out  that  the  Father  put  his  religious  communities                     under the particular protection of Saint Joseph, who is the patron of interior life.                     For this reason he disposed the taking of the garb and the vows on Saint Joseph's                     feasts.  Specifically:  the  Daughters  of  Divine  Zeal  on  March  l8  or  l9;  the                     Rogationists  on  Saint  Joseph's  patronage,  the  third  Wednesday  after  Easter.  It                     was a solemnity in that time, transferable to the following Sunday.                          On these occasions the Father always intervened to arouse the religious fervor                     with his warm, persuading word and to make the people taste the happiness of                     belonging  to  the  Lord  in  our  community.  The  order  was  so  unpretentious  in                     means and development, but was so pleasant to God that he entrusted his divine                     Rogate to it.                          Only one of these speeches was singled out for the press. It was printed in                     Giarre  (Catania)  by  a  periodical  of  sacred  eloquence,  and  is  included  in  the                     volume of the Father's speeches (Vol. 45, pages 384-400). The numerous outlines                     of  the  other  speeches  however,  are  enough  to  reveal  the  Father's  thought  and                     spirit  (S.C.  Vol.  6,  pages  8l-l46).  The  opinion  of  a  theologian  censor  is  the                     following:                                                                                                               766                          The  speeches  of  the  Servant  of  God  are  not  extraordinary,  but  are  well                     devised and full of sound doctrine. When he speaks of the religious life, of its                     benefits and rewards, etc., he becomes eloquent and his thoughts gush out of his                     heart. He displays in a lively and convincing manner the truths he has absorbed                     in  years  of  study  and  prayer.    Unaware,  the  Servant  of  God  unveils  his  spirit                     totally leaning to God and looks for wings to fly higher through the gift of the                     religious  vocation.  The  empty  rhetoric  is  totally  absent  from  these  speeches,                     which are as fresh as they were in the Father's mouth.                           Because we have already treated the vow of the Rogate in chapters 4 and 5,                     now we look at the Father in relation with the","religious vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience. For historical reason we let                     our readers know that the sisters also took a fifth vow in those days: the vow of                     charity.                        A.  Chastity                       2. From his writings                             We  refer  our  readers  to  the  Rogationist  Anthology  (pages  266-270),  and                     report other thoughts of the Father.                          The  rules  for  the  probationers  at  the  beginning  of  the  order  require  of  the                     youth  \"to  accustom  themselves  to  the  holy  practice  of  the  virtues  of  perfect                     chastity, voluntary poverty, and exact obedience.\" Even though the probationers                     do not take these vows, \"still they will embrace them heartily, making them the                     object  of  their  resolves.\"    With  regard  to  chastity,  the  Father  emphasizes  its                     importance and indispensability with these grave words: \"May God see to it that                     this little community be an elect garden of pure lilies, pleasant to the One \"who                     browses  among  the  lilies\"  (Sng.  2,  l6).  Were  it  otherwise,  we  wish  God  to    767                     destroy this little seed at its rising!\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page l69). He writes to the                     Religious:  \"Perfect  chastity.  Our  Lord  said,  'Blessed  are  the  single-hearted  for                     they shall see God'\" (Mt. 5, 8).                          The  pure  of  heart  are  the  chaste  souls.  They  are  compared  to  the  angels                     because they resemble them in the freedom  from  matter and in the life of the                     spirit. For this reason chastity is called the virtue of the angels. It is so sublime                     and singular that only the fortunate souls understand it, according to the saying of                     the infallible witness of the truth, \"Not everyone can accept this teaching, only                     those to whom it is given to do so\" (Mt. l9, 11). Called by God to religious life,                     the  fortunate  souls  must  love  this  angelic  virtue  jealously.  Therefore,  their                     thoughts, works, words, and desires, must be very chaste. To be faithful to the                     vow, the Father recommends the following means:","l. Daily Eucharistic Communion received with a tender love for Jesus Christ. 2.                     Special devotion to the most holy Virgin, Saint Joseph, and the guardian angel. 3.                     Prayer and daily meditation upon the last truths and the Passion of our Lord Jesus                     Christ. 5. Work, avoiding idleness. 6. Humility, because chastity is a reward for                     humility. The proud are never chaste. 7. Mortification of the senses, especially                     sight and gluttony.                           The  Father  ends  with  this  grave  warning,  \"Woe  to  the  soul  consecrated                     through  the  religious  vows  who  staggers  on  this  fundamental  virtue  This  soul                     becomes  quickly  corrupted,  and  goes  into  ruin.  The  enemy  of  souls                     endeavors...to drive it to evil. Because of that Jesus warned us, 'Be on guard, and                     pray that you may not undergo the test\" (S.C. Vol. l0, page l88).                        3. A page of Father Vitale                             The Father says in his funeral oration, \"To the Lord's glory he declares that he                     never  knew  the  actions  that  people  call  dishonest,  obscene,  etc.,  and  he  never                     understood what pleasure people find in them\" (S.C. Vol. 7, page 242). It came            768                     to our knowledge from various witnesses that to qualify himself for confessing                     the faithful, the Father needed explanation on this subject.                          As a youth before knowing his priestly vocation, the Father had a fleeting idea                     of forming  a  family,  thinking  of  a  creature unknown  to  us.  This  event  left  an                     ineffable  sadness  in  his  spirit,  all  his  life  long.  Prof.  Nicotra  let  us  know  this                     episode.  He  adds  that  the  Father  was  always  pure  and  deeply  grieved  by  that                     human  affection  which  pulled  him  away  from  the  love  of  God,  at  least  for  a                     moment, in his way of thinking.                          We continue with this eloquent page of Father Vitale:                           We can say that Canon Di Francia was an angelic man. From the early years                     of his innocent life, he appreciated the priceless treasure of","the virtue without feeling inclined to opposite vice, due to God's grace. From his                     disclosure,  from  his  behavior  in  some  necessary  and  risky  incidents,  from  the                     counsel he asked for, we detect that if ever an obscene thought crossed his mind,                     it  did  not  affect  him.  This  is  not  an  over-statement;  he  himself  wrote  the                     following: \"To the glory of our Lord, I declare that I never knew about actions                     that  people  call  dishonest,  obscene,  etc....  and  never  could  I  understand  the                     pleasure of such actions.\" And yet, he tortured his body and behaved with much                     prudence not only in dealing with immediate problems, but also in working out                     distant risks. Sometimes in his pure conscience, he considered whether he had                     behaved properly about a delicate matter for the good of souls, but later he told                     me: \"For God's grace, I do not know such temptations.\"                          Nonetheless, he was inflexible, harsh against any sign of this vice that could                     harm souls even slightly. A look less than sober, a frivolous touch of a hand, and                     spending  of  time  with  people  of  the  opposite  sex  beyond  what  was  necessary                     were reasons for serious measures.                          One day, seeing a cleric looking here and there on the street, he told me: \"It                     would be better for him to go back to the world.\"                          To caress children, he generally laid his hand lightly on their heads.                          He  used  to  recommend  that  preachers  speak  about  making  people  love                     virginity rather than speaking of the opposite vice beyond what was necessary.                          Performances for youths dealing with worldly matters, which were improper                     and dangerous for them, were forbidden. Sometimes he reproached a missionary              769                     and made him stop a movie because of pictures of naked Indians.                          He never allowed clerics, under pretext of literary culture, to read books or                     magazines hinting at erotic matter; rather he devised a way to lead them away                     from suspicious places and circumstances.                          A young priest reports: \"Once I was with the padre on a bus. All of a sudden,                     he called me and gave me a newspaper he had open in his hands. I thought that                     he  wished  to  save  himself  the  trouble  of  reading;  therefore,  I  began  reading                     aloud. But he told me to read it to myself. Then I understood: he gave the paper                     to divert my eyes from the people coming and going.\"                          He seemed to lose  his natural  mildness in the presence of certain dress for                     young girls, reproaching the parents harshly and running the risk of making them                     react  unfavorably.  Trying  to  convince  him  that  baring  one's  neck  or  chest                     moderately  could  be  tolerated  was  useless.  He  could  not  agree  because  \"the                     small\" would grow \"great.\" He wanted the girls to dress modestly. This was due                     to the purity of his soul.                          How  many  times  he  repeated  Saint  Augustine's  saying:  \"Your  talk  with                     women must be brief and austere\" (Ibid. 32l-322).","4. An angel                              Witnesses confirm this beautiful page of Father Vitale.                           \"To  my  knowledge,  the  Father  always  kept  chastity.  I  deduce  it  from  his                     talking  and  walking.\"  \"He  was  much  reserved  in  his  sight,  especially  with                     women, and was very strict in the observance of this virtue among us.\" \"Walking                     through  the  streets  he  was  very  modest;  I  accompanied  him  often.\"  \"I  can't                     specify anything about chastity, but his holiness appeared from his face.\" \"I can't                     say anything of his innermost, but his external behavior showed an exemplary                     holiness.\" \"I suppose he has always been innocent. I saw him modest in the sight                     -- always.\" \"He walked modestly and recollected. When people saw him, they                     said,  'The  saint  is  passing  by'.\"    \"To  my  knowledge,  his  behavior  was  always                     serious and grave, demanding trust and respect from the priests, sisters, and lay                     people. When he talked of chastity, he always called it the angelic virtue.\"                           On  various  occasions  we  heard  a  few  statements  on  this  subject  from  the                     Servant of God. \"I heard the Servant of God saying that he had known certain                     sins from the study of morals.\" \"With regard to an apostate, he confessed to me                     that he had never had a hint of such temptations; and yet, he coped with world            770                     and church going women. I lived with him more than 27 years; I don't know if I                     am wrong, but I affirm that I smelt such a perfume of holiness.\"                           It is not a marvel, therefore, if the witnesses called him \"an angel\" in their                     reports. \"In such a matter I found nothing different from an angel's purity.\" \"In                     the community we thought of him as of an angel.\"","5.  He spoke of the virtue                              He recommended the caution by Saint Francis of Sales, i. e., to preach on the                     virtue instead of the vice. He disliked the new expression of the catechism, \"You                     shall not do impure actions,\" and in the booklets for our institutes replaced this                     expression with the old one, \"You shall not fornicate.\"                          Speaking of chastity, the Father spoke of its odor, never of the opposite vice.                     \"On the taking of the garb, or the vows, his preaching on the chastity's beauty                     was suggestive, but he never spoke of the opposite vice.\" While teaching that\"                     chastity requires sacrifices, he made us understand that it becomes a source of                     inner  delights  beyond  comparison\"  (Vol.  45,  page  22l).  He  was  very  reserved                     about such a matter in his preaching, nor did he allow other priests to come to                     details, above all about the opposite vice.\" \"He was merciless in supervising the                     performances, and removed any hint of worldly love.\" Msgr. Lojacono, Bishop                     of  Ariano  Irpino,  gave  the  Father  the  works  by  Parzanese:  four  volumes  of                     preaching, and four of poetry. The Father appreciated the gift and was delighted                     in reading the speeches. He read some passages to us, sometimes. However, after                     the Father's death, we found only three volumes of poetry. He had eliminated the                     fourth one, in which the poet sang the chaste love of his town's country people.                     And yet, such people lived in the simplicity of the morals of those times (l800-          771                     l850).                          Nor did he allow the community to read something disturbing. \"In May he                     warned me, because we read a meditation by Father Muzzarelli on the purity. He                     withdrew the booklet from circulation, saying,  'It is unfitting for the orphaned                     girls, and for you, the sisters'.\"  \"I was reading at refectory a rather delicate story,                     but instead of paying  attention to its  meaning, I was looking at the somewhat                     grotesque attitude of a punished probationer; so, I burst into laughter. The Father                     was eating in a nearby room; he thought I was laughing about the reading, and                     got up to call me to order. In private he told me not to laugh at the story which                     regarded the offense to the beautiful virtue.\" \" He was very reserved with us. I                     think that the beautiful virtue was sovereign in his soul. In fact, when I read a                     book  at  refectory  touching  upon  the  opposite  vice,  he  told  me  at  the  end,                     'Daughter, skip those pages. Some of the youth could misunderstand,","receiving evil instead of good'.\"                          A Rogationist who has been many years an assistant to the boys points out,                     \"We were forbidden to discuss with boys inconveniences about morals. It was                     reserved to the Father, or Canon Vitale.\"                       6. With the sisters                            To guide and to form the sisters and the youth, the Father had founder-subject                     relationships. Hence, a certain perplexity, lest he should act against conscience.                     Then he submitted his doubts to Canon Pennino of Palermo, the former confessor                     of Father Cusmano. He responded,                           After reading your letter I think that you behaved egregiously with the sisters                     and the orphaned girls of your communities. So did Father James Cusmano; so                     does  his  successor  Father  Mammana,  a  priest  of  pure  conscience;  so  do  the                     founders. Therefore, Your Reverence may be peaceful, you are in good company                     (September l4, l897).                           The witnesses report, \"As to chastity, to my knowledge he never let women            772                     kiss his hand.\" A sister, \"He was kind and reserved, but his attentions for us were                     carried out by the mother superior. He did not allow us to kiss his hand, and the                     few times we were allowed, we did it, crossing our arms.\"                          I remember:                           It was l924 or l925. Very tired, the Father sat on the landing of the stairs to                     rest a little while. The sisters passing by asked him with filial affection for the                     blessing and how he felt. He stopped that fuss rather sternly, and said to my ear                     (perhaps to teach me, I was a new ordained priest), 'Your talk with women must                     be brief and austere.'                          Because  the  Rogationists'  institute  was  under  construction,  the  Father  was                     compelled to dwell in an apartment at the Holy","Spirit. Due to his health fatally waning, he was cared day and night by a brother.                     Almost every evening we went over there to visit him and receive orders. More                     than once the sisters asked us for necessary information about the house and the                     institution. When the Father realized it, he appeared on the threshold of the door                     and dismissed us with resolute gesture. He prescribed by rule not to let women                     kiss our hand, following his example.\"                          He didn't allow jokes of hands among us, nor to touch one another.                          One day he warned two aspirants when one of them took away an ant from                     the shoulders of the other. He thought it was a gesture of kindness. The witness                     points out, \"It seems excessive, but for the saints it is not.\" The same episode is                     narrated in details by another witness. During the play activity the Father had the                     bell rung for a meeting: he thought that a probationer had laid hands on another                     one, but it resulted that she had took away an ant from the cape. The Servant of                     God remained humiliated.\" \"A probationer who had touched a companion with                     the blessed branch of olive, smiling  (it was on Palm Sunday),  was scolded by                     the Father. She had to ask the mother superior for forgiveness and for a penance.                     A sister who said to an orphaned girl,  'How beautiful you are!'  was admonished                     by the Father.\"                          \"As to chastity, the Father was irreproachable. In our ring-a-ring o'- roses, the                     Father  told  us  to  join  our  hands  with  the  handkerchief  to  avoid  touching  one                     another.  He  used  to  say,  'Whoever  is  chaste,  is  humble  and  obedient'.\"  \"We                     sisters were not allowed to touch one another.\"                                           773                        7. With children                              We  have  said  enough  of  the  Father's  hearty  kindness  toward  children.  But                     someone compared them to the consecrated host, which is touched as necessity                     requires. So did the Father with children.                           After noticing that the Father sometimes washed the feet of the Religious, a                     witness adds, \"But I never saw him washing the feet","of children. He did not do so for modesty sake, I suppose.\" And again, \"I have                     said that the Father didn't wash the feet of children, nor he caressed them;  he                     only  put    his  hand  on  their  heads,  demanding  of  us  the  same  behavior.  He                     prohibited the sisters who took care of the kindergarten children in Rome to wash                     them. A widow was hired for that.\" \"Children were caressed on their heads; we                     were forbidden to carry children in our arms, or to caress them. Once, the Father                     censured me severely because I took a crying child in my arms to console him. I                     was told to deliver him to his parents and mine, who had come to visit me.\"                          The Father did not want the Religious to kiss children. A mother superior who                     asked the permission to wash the feet of the sisters, was told by him, \"I don't                     grant it. If you want, you can do so to children as a mother, for hygiene sake                     only, now and then every other week, but without kissing them\" (Vol. 34, page                     34).                          A sister relates that when she was a probationer, her parents brought a recent                     born niece. The youth kissed her in the presence of the Servant of God. In the                     evening, at the end of the procession of Bambinella Mary, everyone approached                     to kiss her. When the probationer approached, she was told by the Father, \"You                     havekissedyourniece,that'senough.\"                          The rules of another community of sisters taking care of children stated, \"The                     sisters are not allowed to kiss children with much effusion.\" The Father remarked                     to the mother superior, \"Who can bridle an internal effusion, which can easily                     follow? Where will the sister confine the child Jesus, with whom the consecrated          774                     soul enamored of Jesus has to exchange kisses and caresses?\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page                     220). Msgr. Sebastian Militto was distinguished in piety and doctrine. A former                     vicar general, he was fond of the Father and his institution, to which he  sent                     several vocations. Once he brought a  two  years old  orphaned girl to the Holy                     Spirit to be sheltered, and while leaving kissed her good-by in the presence of the                     Father. The Servant of God drove him to the room contiguous to the parlor to                     make him notice that such a manifestation of innocent affection is unfitting for a                     priest. That should be avoided to make the priestly life shine. Relating the fact                     after  so  many  years,  Militto  showed  admiration  for  the  Father's  delicacy  and                     charity, saying that he had kept the brotherly and fatherly warning as a kindest                     memory.","Also Father Messina, a guest of ours for several years, relates a similar episode.                     At  Guardia,  a  baby  was  moving  joyously  in  the  hands  of  his  mom,  leaning                     toward  the  priest  with  raised  hands.  Father  Messina  approached  the  baby  and                     kissed him as to please the mother. The Father called and told Father Messina in                     secret that the tenderness and kindness of the priest toward children should be                     never signified by kisses.                          The  sisters  were  prohibited  to  kiss  one  another:  \"He  recommended  mutual                     charity  and  permitted  to  seal  it  up  with  the  kiss,  but  on  second  thoughts,  he                     decided against the kiss.\"                          We notice a delicacy of his own in a letter about the rite of admission to a                     congregation:                           When the priest questions the candidate, your ritual has, \"My daughter,\" etc.                     These  are  fond  words  between  the  priest  and  the  candidate.  Such  words  are                     unfitting for that solemn moment when the soul must be full of compunction and                     touched for surrendering herself to Jesus, her adorable spouse and divine lover.                     The word 'daughter' should be more than enough, because of its broad meaning:                     daughter of God, of the Church. It is also a hint to a young age that implies and                     makes  the  renunciation  to  the  world  more  beautiful;  and  it  is  fitting  for  the                     Scripture's saying, \"My delights are with the sons of men,\" which we apply to                     Jesus.  Therefore,  the  word  'daughter'  by  itself  should  refer  to  a  simple,  pious,                     innocent soul, in which Jesus wants to find his delights. He separates her from           775                     the world and binds her with his love. The word 'my' hurts all these beautiful                     meanings! (S.C. Vol. 5, page 2l8).                        8. Against fashion                              Knowing the Father's criteria, we can imagine what he thought of fashion.                          In  September  l9l5,  when  Italy  was  already  at  war  since  May,  the  Father                     published  an  article  on  God  and  Neighbor.  After  stating  that  war  is  a  terrible                     punishment of God because of men's sins, he describes the extremes in which                     humanity had fallen. He thinks that the scales of the divine justice were keeping                     balance, but a new sin made them turn.                           \"This great sin is the women's very immodest dressing since","a few years. Their very immodest dressing aiming at making the body appear is                     dreadful. It is the devil that invented it to ruin men and women. But to see how                     the  damned  fashion  has  caught  women  is  more  dreadful  and  causes  surprise.                     Even  the  church  goers,  who  hear  mass  and  go  to  confession,  use  it  without                     shame\" (S.C. Vol. l, page l7l).                           The Father was very strict. A worker remembers: \"One day I entered his room                     having my shirt-sleeves rolled up to the elbow. He told me,  'What's that? There                     are the little girls here!' Looking at him was enough to understand that he was an                     angel in the flesh.\" When he was sick at Guardia, a daughter of a worker went to                     visit him. The Servant of God warned the girl and her father because her clothes                     were not quite decent.\" A witness says, \"As for me, there was nothing wrong.\"                          \"Once, the Father refused an alms from a bare-armed lady, and turning round                     said, 'Please go away, do not scandalize these children'.\"  A sister declares,                           \"The porter had veils in stock to cover the indiscreet devotees coming to pray                     to Saint Anthony in the oratory. The orphaned girls were wearing a long dress to                     atone  the  immodesty  of  the  world's  ladies.  The  Father  also  scolded  his  little                     nephews (Toscano), and he himself sometimes unfolded the newspaper to cover                     their legs, when they sat in his room. The sisters told me that they all laughed                     when the Father related that he had covered with a handkerchief the chest of a                     lady while traveling by train, and that having hired a coach with a lady not quite        776                     decently dressed, he challenged her by saying, 'Or you cover yourself, or I get                     out'.\"                           The Father's delicacy of conscience reached the highest point, when he had                     the pictures of his room covered to act easily.                          Not even in the sacred pictures the Father suffered the nude. He saved from                     the debris of the earthquake a painting of Our Lady of Providence with the child                     by Rodriguez, and kept it at the Holy Spirit. But the Father felt uncomfortable                     before the child painted nude, and called upon Father Catanese, who delighted in                     painting,  to  have  the  child  covered  with  fluttering  clothes.  Is  it  exaggeration?                     Perhaps,  but  even  in  this  the  Father  is  in  a  good  company  with  Saint  Charles                     Borromeo (A. Deroo, S. Carlo Borromeo, il Cardinale riformatore, page l95), and                     Saint Vincent Pallotti. The latter had a veil painted around the hips of the child,                     who is at the center of the altar-piece in the chapel of Saint","Charles, at the new church\" (F. Amoroso, Saint Vincent Pallotti, romano, page                     l06).                          Says a witness: \"Speaking of Raffaello's Logge, some people refer a Father's                     saying, \"Were I responsible, I wouldn't bear them one day.\" I myself heard the                     Father saying to Father Vitale, \"I would like to be the Pope fifteen minutes to                     cover the nude of the Vatican rooms.\" Besides, this is not an original thought of                     the Father. In fact, when the Sistine chapel was opened, Rome was scandalized,                     and people protested against it. Still Michelangelo living, Pope Pius IV, perhaps                     also  advised  by  his  nephew  Saint  Charles,  had  the  nude  of  the  Universal                     Judgment  covered  by  Daniel  Ricciarelli  of  Volterra  (l509-l556),  who  was                     nicknamed  \"Bragettone.\"    Saint  Pius  V  had  this  worthy  job  finished  (Daniel                     Rops, La reforme catholique, page 98, ll2).                          One  more  witness.  \"The  youth  who  visited  Rome  with  the  Father,  were                     advised to see streets and monuments which had nothing against the virtue.\"                        B. Poverty                        9. The Father's thoughts                                                                                                                777                            The Second Vatican Council reminds us, \"The poverty embraced of one's own                     free will to follow Christ, is a sign very appreciated today. Therefore it exhorts                     the Religious to cultivate it carefully (P.C. l3). If we follow the Father's teaching                     (Rogationist  Anthology,  pages  252-259),  we'll  comply  with  the  Council's                     prescriptions. We report additional thoughts of the Father.                           Before the birth of Jesus, the virtue of holy poverty was entirely unknown to                     the world. Our Lord made a chief demonstration of it. By his will he was born a                     poor, lived as a poor, and died in greatest poverty. Besides giving a very splendid                     example, our Lord exalted poverty with his doctrine. He narrated the parable of                     the  pearl  hidden  in  a  field,  which  a  smart  dealer  bought  by  selling  all  his                     belongings;  called  the  poor  happy,  but  the  rich  unfortunate;  and  promised  an                     everlasting exaltation to","evangelical poverty... All saints were enamored of this virtue, considering it in                     our Lord Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary. From God, he made himself a very                     poor man needy of everything; his Mother was his perfect imitator.                          Saint Francis of Assisi called poverty his beloved spouse, and out of love for                     it he became the model and the teacher of this religious virtue. Also Saint Joseph                     Labre  was  a  spectacle  of  poverty  to  the  angels  and  the  world,  because  he                     combined extreme poverty with abjection! Oh, how these champions of the holy                     Church were rewarded by God!                          Holy  poverty  is  the  source  of  several  virtues  such  as  humility,  patience,                     temperance, and holy detachment. It is the real treasure which is hidden to the                     world. To get this virtue, we must sell the glory of the world!                           The Father recalls a circumstance which binds the Rogationists to poverty:                           The  congregants  of  this  least  order  will  have  a  loving  enthusiasm  for  holy                     poverty.  They  are  called  to  it  by  God  with  a  particular  vocation  because  of                     Avignone. This quarter is notorious for its poverty and abjection; our community                     is born here; and all of us  surrender to the divine providence, because we are                     lacking everything in the midst of a poor flock. Therefore, going out of this holy                     start would be a worse crime for us, since the provident hand of the Lord  placed                     us in it. By God's help may our small religious family appreciate our luck, and                     hold  evangelical  poverty  as  our  own  precious  dowry.  If  we  want  the  noble      778                     uniform  of  poverty  to  form  our  honor,  we  must  love  and  hold  it  with  its                     inconveniences, as the provident God wants. We must never pretend the honor of                     poverty and the comforts of the riches. \"It would be a too big ambition,\" said the                     holy bishop of Geneva.\"                          To avoid that the devil swerve us from these principles under the pretext of                     good, the Father recommends attention and watchfulness.                           Beware of a trick of the devil. Because we are fortunately committed to the                     salvation of souls, to the relief of our neighbor, and to the formation of this least                     religious  order,  we  need  plenty  of  means.  May  God  help  us  search  for  such                     means with purity of intention and without any thought of self. May he free us                     from the enemy of the virtue and souls, because he tries to distort such purity.                     Let us be vigilant on this matter, holding that the sound works of religion and                     Christian  charity  are  formed  with  the  practice  of  the  holy  virtues,  such  as                     humility,","patience, and faith in God, not with money or terrestrial means. The practice of                     pure  charity  combined  with  evangelical  poverty  is  a  perennial  source  of                     providence for usand others! (S.C. Vol. l0, pages l9l-l92).                       10. The first poor of Avignone Quarter                              The Father devoted himself to the poor, living among, and for them. For this                     reason Father Vitale wrote, \"Our padre, the first poor man of Avignone, seemed                     envious of those he fed and clothed. More than once, he seated himself and ate                     with them to enjoy their company and to be one of them\" (Ibid. page 3l9).                          \"The  spirit  of  poverty  he  cultivated  sprang  his  majestic  institutes.\"  \"We                     understand the Servant of God's spirit of poverty from his giving up everything                     for the poor, and from his holding the poor as the owners of the money he ran.\"                     \"His observance of the vow of poverty was illuminated by charity for others and                     by  self-denial...  He  taught  us  that  the  blooming  of  the  communities  is  due  to                     poverty, whereas their ruin is due to contempt of it. He used to say that begging                     is a practice of poverty,  'Whoever asks is a poor'.\"  \"He recommended poverty as                     the guardian of our communities; in default of it, the Lord would punish them.\"           779                     \"He lived the spirit of poverty, and proposed Saint Francis of Assisi along with                     Saint Joseph Labre as models.\"                          \"Strictly  observant  of  poverty,  and  to  save  money  for  the  poor,  more  than                     once he prohibited me to buy expensive fish. Also our clothes were cheap, and he                     himself checked the price saying,  'The poor too have to eat.'  Money was for the                     poor and the institutes; we had to conform to this tenet. The Father checked our                     belongings to see if poverty was observed.\"                          \"He dressed as a poor man, and poor was his dwelling room. He often ran out                     of his underwear, because he gave it up to the poor, even while traveling. I heard                     that  his  fellow  canons  mumbled  when  he  was  elected  a  canon  and  appeared                     among them wearing used clothes. But he used to say calmly, 'Leave me","alone,  I  have  my  poor”!\"    \"It  came  to  my  knowledge  that  he  bought  used                     canonical clothes. He taught us that the spirit of poverty draws upon us special                     graces from the Lord.\"                          \"He was imbued with the spirit of poverty. The sisters once hired a second                     class hearse; they were admonished by him, 'These are useless expenses. For me,                     do not even hire a third class hearse. When I die, a hand-cart will be enough for                     me'.\"                          A sister remembers, \"When I was given a nickel silver-ware as a present, I put                     it at the Father's seat at refectory. As soon as he came, he asked me if we had tin-                     ware. I had one. I cleaned it and gave it to him. He said, 'I like it. It is useful'!\"                          \"The mother superior at the Holy Spirit replaced the curtains of the reception                     room  with  better  ones.  When  the  Father  saw  them,  he  said,  'No,  no.  This  is                     contrary  to  the  spirit  of  poverty.'  We  had  to  remove  them.\"    Another  sister                     reports, \"I found in the drawer of the mother superior a penknife with a piece of                     paper. I read, 'The Father forbade to use it, because it is stylish.' I said to myself,                     'Where is the style?' It was a common penknife which is sold on the booths; but                     the handle was of nacre, and the Father refused it.\"                          He wrote:                           The  mother  superiors  will  avoid  spending  unnecessary  money  for  the                     community's maintenance, remembering that they have taken the vow of poverty,                     that they must use (and not abuse) the divine providence's affluence, otherwise           780                     they offend our Lord, stopping him from helping us. The community  must be                     provided with the necessary food, clothes, furniture, accessories, etc., avoiding                     the surplus. The necessary objects will be of the lowest grade, except the ones for                     the use of noble guests. Do not say that some things are cheaper because they last                     more; even those of low grade may last if they are given careful attention. It is                     also of no avail saying that some elegant things are given free. We must avoid                     the devil's snare. Sometimes we have to renounce such gifts, and when courtesy                     obliges us to receive them, we can sell the marketable ones, putting the others in                     the  guest  rooms,  or  reserving  them  for  the  noble  persons,  but  never  for  the                     Religious (Vol. l, page 222).","11. The father's room                              The  communities  founded  by  the  Father  reserved  a  room  for  him;  it  was                     different from house to house, even though a poor and modest one. Obviously,                     the witnesses talk about the room they saw, and for this reason their relations are                     different.                          \"I have always noticed that the superior's room is more comfortable than the                     room of others; but, the room of the Servant of God was not. The priests told me                     that he used to foster the spirit of poverty through instructions.\" Out of poverty,                     he kept the holy water in his room in a glass.                          \"Extreme poverty reigned in Avignone: floor of rough wood, chairs of rope,                     and earthenware. Father Cusmano of Palermo said that the place was suffocating                     the institution.\" \"His room was lacking everything; it was one of the slum. When                     a  religious  student  came  from  Oria  to  Messina  to  continue  the  study  for                     priesthood, he wrote, 'Saint Francis would be envious of our Father's poverty!'                     When people began taking the vows, rigor of poverty was somehow moderated                     in order to preserve vocations.\"                          \"He loved so much the little cells of the former Alcantarine convent in Oria.                     He dwelt willingly in them, and disliked any remodeling. When a Religious did                     so  without  informing  him,  the  Father  told  him  sadly,  'You  are  an  anti-        781                     Franciscan”!\" Listen to the transformer,                           How many times he complained about the remodel I made in the floor of his                     cell in Oria! It was of earthen pots, rubbles, and lime worn out. I replaced it with                     variegated tiles, which were cheaper than the previous system of floor. But he                     told me that we must distinguish between economy and poverty. Not everything                     which is cheaper is fitting for a Religious. For instance, the friars perhaps pay                     more for the clothes established by rule. When I made him notice that the floor of                     the orphans' dormitories was better, he let me consider that the orphans do not                     take the vow of poverty. As to food and clothes, he made all sort of sacrifices.                     And yet, he was so generous and refined toward the sick and the strangers. His                     room was bare. On the occasion of a bishop's visit, we were arranging something                     from other rooms, but he stopped us calmly by saying that after all the bishop                     was visiting a poor Religious.                           The  community's  matresses  were  on  wire  net  bedsteads;  the  Father's,  on                     planks supported by wooden trestles.","\"For  about  ten  days  after  the  opening  of  the  institute  of  Oria,  we  slept  on                     emergency  beds,  or  mats,  or  blankets;  the  Father  slept  on  planks  covered  by                     sheets. He said that an old man's bones are more resistant than children's. And he                     was  the  cook  and  the  scullion  for  two  weeks,  doing  everything  fairly  well                     naturally, and giving examples of poverty and humility. A terra-cotta cup on a                     system of his own at refectory had many uses. He had the earthen plates from                     Grottaglie inscribed with moral sayings, and each of us used one plate only.\"                           Other relations about these episodes emphasize quite a few details. \"He hardly                     suffered the change of his room's floor, remodeled in his absence; but he kept his                     matress on planks laid on wooden trestles.\"  We can still see his poor room in                     Oria: his bed with planks and wooden trestles; a rope to lay out his washing; long                     nails,  wrapped  in  fabric,  as  clothes  hooks.  From  his  spirit  of  poverty  we                     understand why he liked to be in the midst of the poor, eating like one of them.                     \"The  Father  lectured  frequently  on  the  spirit  of  poverty,  and  did  so  solemnly                     during the nine days of preparation for the renewal of the vows.\"                          \"He  wanted  his  room  simple  and  whitewashed,  a  few  pieces  of  furniture,                     sacred pictures, and some papers. Every object of the house should be kept with                     care, else it would displease him.\" A sister remembers, \"Accompanied by another                     sister I entered his little room to talk to him. I marveled at the bare walls and his                     big, reddish slippers, which I judged unfitting for a priest.\" \"His room was poor,                     but rich of sacred relics closed in a board. He often exhorted us to live the spirit      782                     of poverty, following the example of our Lord, Saint Francis of Assisi, etc.\"                          \"In Trani, the Father prohibited to replace the wooden floor with tiles.\" His                     small, poor cell was like a Franciscan one. \"When we were willing to prepare a                     better  room  for  him,  he  told  us  with  simplicity,    'No,  daughters,  I  am  very                     comfortable. Not even in Messina I enjoy these comforts'!...\"                          The mother superior of Taormina community made her attempts to replace his                     hard matress with two new ones.                           \"I wish I never did! I was solemnly scolded and ordered to return the old one.                     I  thought  of  eluding  the  order  by  forming  one  matress  from  the  two,  but  I                     exposed myself to additional admonitions, being defined as narrow-minded and                     obstinate.  I  lost!...  His  furniture:  two  chairs,  a  desk,  a  rough  clothes-hook,  an                     earthen basin, a chest-of-drawers, a crucifix, some books, and some","pictures on the walls, among which his very dear Saint Joseph Labre, the saint of                     the lousy. Woe if anyone tried to change something under any pretext. But he                     thanked me smiling when I gave him five volumes by Martini.\"                        12. His clothes                              Modesty and poverty had their own marks on the Father's clothes, and we had                     to take care to renew them. We had to suggest to him the changing of his hat or                     clothes  when  they  were  shabby,  or  worn  out,  or  he  was  going  to  a  meeting                     requiring better clothes. He, however, was scrupulous about personal hygiene.                          Humble, colorless clothes, and shoes often mended were his attire. More than                     once Saint Vincent de Paul society provided him with cassock, because the one                     he was wearing was indecorous. Also other benefactors helped him with clothes,                     but such gifts often finished up in the hands of the poor.                          Once, Father Catanese bought a new hat for the Father, and did away with the                     old  one  to  have  him  wear  the  new  hat.  The  sisters  sometimes  made  a  new                     cassock for him, but he was not satisfied. He said that money could have been                     given to the poor, whereas his old cassock could last longer. Anyhow, his clothes         783                     should be ever of common fabric, and underwear of rough cloth.                          Say the sisters,                           \"One day that our founder was going to the Holy Father - say the sisters - we                     concealed his mended shoes and gave him a new pair. He didn't give in: we had                     to return the old ones. We do not know why, but the shoemaker once decided to                     make a squeaking pair of shoes for the Father. Hearing the squeaking, the Father                     became indignant, and exclaimed, 'What is this vanity?' He had that pair of shoes                     immediately burnt.                          When a Religious was wearing a new cassock without any good reason, the                     Father became sad and invited him to change it.                          A sister remembers: \"One day the Father told the master to lecture me because                     not only had I repaired and cleaned his","cassock,  but  I  also  tried  to  iron  it.  He  said  that  it  was  against  the  spirit  of                     poverty.\"                          Poverty  and  cleanliness  get  on  well  together,  and  the  Father  showed  it  by                     combining the spirit of poverty with the sense of hygiene. He loved so much the                     hydrotherapeutics by Kneipp. His sight proclaimed a clean poverty.                          Writes Father Vitale,                           \"Everyone agreed, however, that he concentrated more on cleanliness than on                     showiness. Later, even when his cassock was mended and his shoes were worn                     and repaired, or when his mantle turned yellow with age, he would be spotless                     and  dust-free.  His  clean  spirit  was  reflected  in  his  immaculate  exterior\"  (Ibid.                     page l6).                        13. Always poverty in everything                             Poverty  while  traveling.  We have  already hinted  at it, but let us read  more                     witnesses. Remarks Father Vitale:                                                                                                               784                          \"In his old age, he was forced to lessen the strictness of his poverty regarding                     food,  travel,  and  accommodations,  especially  because  of  the  ailments  of  his                     sickness. But he always remained interiorly detached from these comforts\" (Ibid.                     page 32l). Health reasons forced him to lessen the strictness, but he never wanted                     a  second  class  ticket.  \"He  often  traveled  by  third  class  train  to  visit  his                     communities in Sicily and Apulia.\"  \"Once, while preparing to travel, he thought                     that the sisters were buying a second class ticket for him. Quickly, he entered a                     third class car leaving the sisters to risk missing the train\" (Ibid. page 32l). One                     day, however, the Father traveled in a sleeping car... Listen to Father Carmel:                     \"He always traveled by third class car, but once. He traveled in a sleeping car                     from Trani to Rome by order of the doctor, because he suffered from leg disease.                     The citizens of Trani were amazed. I myself left from Oria to assist him during                     the trip.\" It happened in September-October when the Father","was busy buying the house in Rome.                          In his last days, he refused the automobile and preferred the calash pulled by a                     donkey.                          A gentleman of Ceglie owned a mare that was the marvel of the town. After                     the first world war, he bought a car and had to get rid of the animal he loved so                     much. He decided to sell it at a very cheap price to Father Palma for the orphans.                     When the Servant of God traveled to Oria, Father Palma went to the station to                     pick him up with the mare. As soon as the Father saw the animal, he exclaimed,                     \"No,  Father  Palma.  This  mare  is  for  lords,  it  is  unfit  for  us.\"  Father  Palma                     defended himself by explaining that it was almost a gift, etc., but the Servant of                     God didn't want to listen to any reason and ordered the return of the mare to the                     owner. While Father Palma was trying to convince the owner to retake the mare,                     this mare slipped downhill Saint Benedict, dashed against the cathedral's walls,                     and  died.  Afterward,  Mrs.  Martini  donated  a  lame  horse,  which  the  orphans                     nicknamed tripod. Looking at it, the Father said, \"This is fit for us. The other one                     was for lords, and God took it away.\"                          Instead of a leather bag, he carried books and personal things under his mantle                     in a big colored handkerchief. He did the same while traveling, as a farm-worker.                          The canonical vestments were implemented by a pair of buckles on the shoes                     and the ring at the finger. Father Vitale narrates how the Father got rid of his                     buckles  by  giving  them  to  him  (Ibid.  page  320).  The  ring  served  him  several                     times, when he had no money. A sister testifies: \"The first time I saw the Father         785                     at Palmi, he was wearing the ring. In Messina I never saw him wearing it.\" That                     ring went back and forth as a pledge at the pawnshop, or at the Marchioness of                     Cassibile  when  the  Father  borrowed  money  for  his  charitable  works.  Father                     Russello says that more than once he and Father D'Agostino redeemed that ring.                     At last, the ring was placed on the finger of the statue of Immaculate Mary, in the                     church of Saint Francis (Vitale, Ibid. page 320).                          The Father sought poverty in everything. Writes Father Vitale:                           \"One day, we were at table as guests of a religious community, and the padre                     had  doubts  about  something  that  could  harm  poverty  at  dinner.  But  when  we                     realized  there  was  a  lack  of  glasses  (some  of  them  that  were  there  were  even                     damaged), then the padre said joyfully: 'I am going to rejoice! We are among                     poor; there is no danger'!\" (Ibid. page 32l).","This  was  the  spirit  he  infused  in  the  communities.  \"As  to  the  spirit  of                     poverty,  at  the  beginning,  in  Avignone,  we  used  the  terra-cotta  cup  and  the                     earthen plate for the first and second dish. The poor used the same plates after                     being washed. To wash, we used a small bowl.\"                          Poverty in the food. \"When the Father saw grated cheese on the macaroni at                     Taormina, he felt bad (the sisters had put it for the Father's presence). Back to                     Messina, he asked the mother superior how the matter of cheese was regulated.                     She answered that it was used at Christmas, Easter, July first, and on the name's                     day of the mother superior. He approved such a procedure and sent a circular to                     the houses to recommend the spirit of poverty.\" \"Once I was warned about the                     spirit of poverty for having used one more plate while waiting on him.\"  \"One                     day  the  Father  asked  Mother  Nazzarena  whether  the  trimmings  of  the  second                     dish  would  amount  to  a  third  dish;  in  such  a  case,  they  should  be  eliminated                     because of poverty; for the same reason he recommended to serve only one kind                     of fruit.\"                          When the Father happened to cause some damage to the house... he repaired.                     \"While saying mass at Taormina, he broke a cruet. To make up for the loss, he                     knelt at refectory, eating bread only and drinking water. He used to do so every                     time he happened to cause a damage.\"                           Due to his perfect spirit of poverty, he wrote on pieces of paper and sent a                     circular  to  the  convents  he  helped,  advising  against  writing  every  other  page.   786                     Thus, he would take advantage of the blank ones. The Father did so to settle an                     example.                          \"He inculcated all  of us with the spirit of poverty. At refectory, he wanted                     nothing to be wasted.\" \"I was warned about the spirit of poverty for having oiled                     a  paper  while  roasting  a  fish.\"  \"While  recommending  to  waste  nothing  in  the                     kitchen, he used to say, 'When lead is enough, do not use gold.' And he referred                     above all to pottery. But when the matter was the house of God, he taught us to                     be generous in everything, except in the things used by him.\"                          Witnesses  about  the  use  of  money  end  this  topic.           He  used  to  have  no                     money.(l) It was the mother superior who helped the religious institutions, while                     the door keeper took care of the ordinary, small alms. \"He had no money; the                     brother who accompanied him took care of it.\"  \"Money never reigned","in  his  pocket.  He  said,  'Generous,  but  secret  alms'!\"    \"Sparing  for  himself,  he                     wanted the others to lack nothing.\" The Father wanted the necessary never to fail,                     and recommended to abhor superfluous things.                       C. Obedience                        14. Listen to the Father                              Today's  strongest  contestations  in  the  Church  regard  obedience.  But,  the                     Christian who wants to perfectly live his faith will also follow the magistery's                     teaching  on  obedience.  Besides,  Perfectae  caritatis  (no.  l4)  and  Evangelica                     testificatio (no. 23-29) teach the nature and the pledge of this virtue. We quote a                     few  teachings  by  the  Father  which  agree  with  the  recent  documents  of  the                     Church.  While  the  Church's  documents  discuss  the  subject  theologically,  the                     Father develops its ascetic importance.                           Inanimate nature obeys divine will perfectly and continuously. Men should do                     the same, but because they fail in such a matter, the Religious must make up for          787                     such a failure. They consecrate themselves to God to be at disposal of his divine                     will.  This  adorable  will  cannot  be  fulfilled  but  through  holy  obedience  to  our                     superiors.                          The vow of obedience is the most special feature of a religious institute. It                     cannot be conceived without perfect obedience. Whoever consecrates himself to                     a religion, he must be aware that he devotes himself to obey the superiors: their                     will, will be his will. The more the Religious is obedient, the more he will be                     perfect and holy, exteriorly and interiorly, temporally and spiritually!                          Oh, admirable mysteries of Wisdom! When the Religious depends perfectly                     on the will of others, he seems to have lost his own liberty, becoming a slave. In                     reality,  the  Religious  who  sees  God  in  the  superiors,  depends  on  God,  not  on                     men. God himself takes over this elect by governing, ruling, guiding, and leading                     through  the  superiors.  The  superior  seems  to  do  what  he  wants  with  this                     Religious, but it is God who is performing his own will jealously. The perfectly                     obedient Religious belongs to God; he cannot be a subject or a slave of human                     will. He enjoys the true, great freedom of the children of God.(2)","Besides, holy obedience drives the Religious to a great holiness in short time,                     enriches him with virtues, and makes him very dear to the most holy Heart of                     Jesus.  Everything  he  does  by  obedience  will  bloom,  will  be  blessed  by  God.                     Even  the  least,  or  unimportant  actions  will  become  a  source  of  temporal,  and                     spiritual treasures!                          These  are  the  delicious  fruits  of  an  obedient  Religious.  The  fruits  of  an                     obedient community may be seen in the orders blessed by God, which have given                     so many saints to the Church. A community of perfect obedience is an invincible                     fortress; hell can do nothing against it. It is like a plant whose profound roots                     neither the winds nor the storms are able to root out; it is like a temple, where                     God reigns as in heaven; like a fertile soil producing flowers and fruits of virtues                     and good works. It is a congregation of saints, and an image of paradise! The                     community  of  perfect  obedience  is  blessed  by  God  and  by  the  charity  of  the                     Heart of Jesus. Unfortunate whoever raises the flag of rebellion, and opposes the                     orders of obedience in an observant community! Other members will follow the                     example making Satan reign instead of God! (S.C. Vol. l0, page l89).(3)                        15. Always obedient                                                                                                                788                            First, let us see the Father's obedience in his family. He was always obedient                     to his mother, except when he took the cassock. Says Father D'Agostino, \"I knew                     from him that while a boy he longed for riding a bicycle, but he didn't because                     his teachers prohibited him.\"  \"I heard him saying, 'I always obeyed my parents,                     except when my mother tried to oppose my vocation.\"   Mrs. Schiro', a niece of                     the Father, testifies, \"My mom said that the Servant of God was always obedient                     to her. When she complained to the archbishop for her son's complete dedication                     to  the  poor,  up  to  neglect  his  elementary  needs,  the  Father  told  her,  smiling                     humbly,  'Mom, what have you done'?\"                           As  a  founder,  he  was  the  superior  of  the  institution  and  everyone                     acknowledged such an office willingly.  But he performed everything in the spirit                     of obedience, the virtue he loved in","a special way. He found the will of God in the obedience, and wanted us to do                     the  same.  He  held  obedience  as  the  mother  of  the  vows.  The  sisters  say  that                     before undertaking anything of importance, he took advice from them. \"He told                     us  that  obedience  is  the  royal  virtue  leading  to  paradise,  and  he  himself  took                     advice  from  the  mother  superior  before  making  a  decision.\"  \"He  never  did                     anything without the permission of the bishop, or the mayor, or the pastor, and                     demanded that we do the same.\"  \"He often relied on the mother superiors' or the                     sisters' counsel and opinion, when he deemed it was better.\"  A sister submitted                     to his approval a list of acts of penance for Lent time; one of her penances was                     'blind obedience.' The Father added in writing,  'All life long.'(4)                          Sometimes,  the  Father  found  a  way  to  obey  his  subjects.  \"For  practice  of                     obedience  he  often  asked  his  subordinates,  even  lay-brothers,  for  drinking                     between meal, making use of something, going somewhere, etc. He used to say                     that  there  is  also  a  way  to  obey  the  subordinates.  He  often  recommended  the                     obedience by faith. To emphasize it, he once placed a child of about six years                     among us saying, \"If I appoint him as your superior, you must obey him as you                     obey me.\" \"He always asked advice from the mother superior and the Rogationist                     Fathers, following their proposal willingly.\"                          \"To  drink  between  meal,  we  used  to  ask  permission  from  the  immediate                     superior. Once, the Father asked from Brother Mariano the permission to drink.                     Amazed,  Brother  Mariano  said  'no'  to  signify  that  the  Father  should  not  ask                     permission from him. The Servant of God stuck to the letter of his 'no' and any           789                     attempt  to  convince  him  to  drink  was  vain.\"    \"Sometimes  the  Father  asked                     permission for little things from Father Vitale, or Father Palma, or an old brother                     like Mariantonio,  who used to accompany  him. Being the superior, the Father                     took these occasions to practice obedience. I know that he asked and followed                     the  counsels  of  the  ecclesiastical  superior,  or  Father  Vitale  and  Father  Palma.                     Father Vitale told me that the Servant of God sometimes acted contrary to his                     own way of thinking. Upon request of the reason, he manifested with gravity and                     simplicity who had counseled him to do so.\"                          His  respect  toward  the  ecclesiastical  authorities  was  more  remarkable  than                     toward the civil ones. Strictly regarding the parish's rights, the Father asked the                     permission of the pastor to do some work at the Holy Spirit on Sunday, or to                     accompany  a  dead  person  to  the  cemetery.  He  also  invited  the  pastor  for  the                     Easter blessing to the house of the Holy Spirit. Says a daughter","of the Sacred Side, \"When he visited our communities, he was respectful of the                     pastors and the bishops, exhorting us to do the same.\"                        16. With the bishops                              Writes Father Vitale,                           \"He was like a lamb in the hands of the ecclesiastical authorities: as soon as                     he knew their wishes  he worked  expediently and precisely according to them.                     Not  only  for  himself  but  also  for  our  example,  he  never  followed  his  own                     opinion; instead he obeyed superiors not only overtly but also on the inside by                     conforming to their opinions and points of view. In certain circumstances when                     his  superiors'  point  of  view  was  the  opposite  of  his  own,  he  turned  to  their                     opinions.  One  day,  he  protested  against  someone  who  tried  to  stop  him  from                     perfect submission and exclaimed: 'He is my superior; that is enough for me to                     follow him blindly'!\" (Ibid. page 3l7).                           Let us read additional witnesses \"His  mail eloquently  speaks of his perfect        790                     obedience to the Ordinaries.\"  Perfectly obedient to the Holy Father, he disliked                     hearing  the  distinction  between  the  Pope  speaking  ex  cathedra  and  not  ex                     cathedra. He followed not only the orders, but also the counsels of the bishops.\"                     \"His  reverence  toward  the  bishops  results  from  his  recommendations  to  us  in                     Oria. He said, 'Children, attention! As soon as you see the bishop in the street,                     run to him, kneel, kiss the ring, and ask for the blessing, as you do in Messina.                     The bishop represents the Lord, and your behavior will set a good example to the                     citizens of Oria, who are little expansive with the bishop'.\"                          Specifically, let us see some of the Father's relations with Msgr. Di Tommaso,                     Bishop of Oria, and Msgr. Razzoli, Bishop of Potenza.                          Sometimes the Servant of God had an opinion different from","Msgr. Di Tommaso. \"Msgr. Di Tommaso, Bishop of Oria, sometimes said that he                     had points of view differing from the Servant of God, but in the end the Father                     always conformed to him.\" The following witness is more exact. \"He was always                     obedient  to  the  bishops.  For  instance,  when  the  Servant  of  God  asked  the                     permission to have the Blessed Sacrament permanently in the oratory, Msgr. Di                     Tommaso denied his request. The Servant of God responded, 'That is vital for us.                     Nevertheless, God's will be done. I am happy.' The bishop in return said, 'And I                     grant  you  the  permission  because  of  your  obedience.'      The  bishop  himself                     narrated this happy incident.\" However, in his narration the bishop shortens the                     times, because the Father's obedience of a few years bent the bishop in l9l7. On                     that occasion the Father thanked Msgr. Di Tommaso and begged his forgiveness                     for having insisted several times. He added, \"Surely, the Holy Spirit appointed                     the  bishops  at  the  government  of  the  Church;  therefore,  they  are  specially                     enlightened. To oppose such enlightenment is temerity. We should rather respect                     it in silence without inquiring.\" (Vol. 29, page 7l).                          Msgr.  Di  Tommaso  understood  the  work  of  the  Father,  and  said,  \"You                     evangelized Oria!\"   As a  matter  of fact, before our arrival at  Oria, the  priests                     were  the  target  of  carrots,  tomatoes,  and  cores  from  children.  Our  school  of                     catechism along with the rewards and plays attracted and regenerated children.\"                          Keeping  silence  about  dispositions  from  superiors  recalls  an  episode                     regarding Father Occhiuto. He served the Daughters of Divine Zeal for several                     years as a chaplain at Saint Eufemia of Aspromonte. He writes, \"In l925, I was            791                     smitten by my superior because the bishop of Mileto took action against me after                     people insinuated suspicions about him. I went to Messina and asked the Father                     for  advice  and  intervention.  He  encouraged  me  to  be  patient  in  my  suffering,                     saying mildly,  'Silence changes a misinformed superior's mind.'   He talked by                     experience. With time, my silence proved the truth of his advice.\"                          We have already treated the Father's unexceptional behavior in his relations                     with  Msgr.  Razzoli  in  our  reference  to  \"The  Father  and  the  Daughters  of  the                     Sacred  Side.\"  Now,  we  confine  ourselves  to  quoting  one  of  those  sisters  and                     Msgr. Farina, a former apostolic visitor to the institute.                          \"When the Father was forbidden to come over to our house of Potenza,\" says                     the sister,  \"I along with a few of the postulators protested against the prohibition.                     But,  he  told  us  thoughtfully,  'We  must  obey  blindly.  The  superiors  represent                     God.'   Besides, in his lectures he often said, 'Practice scrupulous obedience to","the priests and the bishops.'  Before making a final decision, he used to say, 'We                     must inform the bishop, and follow his opinion'.\"                             Msgr. Farina vouches:                           I  was  struck  by  his  respectful  behavior  toward  the  ecclesiastical  superiors,                     included Msgr. Razzoli, Bishop of Marsico and Potenza, who was ill-disposed                     against and dealt with him very severely. I never heard from his mouth a word of                     complaint, nor a word of grumbling against anyone.                           Regarding the prohibition of Msgr. Razzoli, he says,                        Canon  Di  Francia  received  the  hard,  humiliating  disposition,  and  obeyed                     perfectly.  While  talking  with  me,  he  spoke  of  that  prelate  with  all  respectful                     regard, even though he disagreed upon his judgment about the two sisters. On the                     whole, I was always edified by his peace and composure, even though he was                     suffering opposition and ingratitude to his direction of the nascent institute. And                     yet, he had accepted the burden of the direction by reasons of charity; as well as                     to  keep  so  many  initiatives  of  good  alive;  such  initiatives  are  humble  in                     themselves, but very useful to humble towns.\"                                                                                                                792                      17. With his ordinary                              Touching upon the Father's relations with various bishops, we must recall the                     Ordinaries  of  Messina  under  whose  government  he  developed  his  activity.                     Specifically,  Cardinal  Joseph  Guarino  (l875-l897),  Msgr.  Letterio  D'Arrigo                     (l898-l922), and Msgr. Angel Paino (l923-l927).                           Let  us  see  the  Father's  condition  of  spirit  on  this  matter.  I  remember  him                     saying that if the superiors dismissed him from taking care of the institution, he                     would obey heartily, asking God for being peaceful. When the two congregations                     were  approved,  he  wrote  to  Father  Vitale,  \"If  Monsignor,  or  whoever  on  his                     behalf, orders me not to take care of the sisters any longer, I am","ready to obey quickly and joyfully with the grace of the Lord\" (Vol. 33, page                     ll9).                          Cardinal Guarino.  At the beginning of his priesthood, the Father went to Oria                     to visit Maria Palma. On that occasion he was invited to preach a triduo upon                     Our Lady of Lourdes in Saint Dominic's church, and to introduce her devotion in                     the town. He would have accepted the invitation immediately, but he liked to ask                     the permission from his archbishop, and wrote to him,                          \"Even though I long for preaching in honor of the most holy Mary, still I want                     to say not even one ejaculatory prayer without a clear, explicit, and spontaneous                     permission from Your Eminence (the underline is by the Father). I am convinced                     that everything done without obedience is lost, and I do not want to be told, 'You                     worked all night, and caught nothing'.\" (May 2, l878).                          A witness testifies,                          \"The Servant of God was heartily submitted to the bishops, and his spirit of                     initiative  was  hardly  tested  when  Msgr.  Guarino  told  him  to  have  patience,                     because  Marchioness  of  Cassibile  would  have  built  both  the  church  and  the                     institute. He waited in vain for five or six years. It happened the same when the                     Father  was  told  to  assist  his  brother  sick  of  neurasthenia.  He  pretended  that                     Hannibal be at his side always.\"                           Father Vitale remembers: \"When Cardinal Guarino heard someone knocking                     at  the  door  in  the  night,  he  used  to  say  facetiously,  'This  must  be  Canon  Di                     Francia asking for an obedience.' - He hinted at the nightly visits of the Father         793                     who  wanted  to  be  enlightened,  taking  advice  from  the  Ordinary  for  his  own                     initiatives in order to be absolutely dependent on the ecclesiastical authority in                     his priestly ministry.\" Besides being submitted and obedient to the ecclesiastical                     superiors,  the  Father  was  also  very  devout  to  Archbishop  Guarino,  who  was                     created  a  cardinal.  At  his  death,  the  Father  took  care  of  the  funeral,  said  the                     eulogy, and printed a special issue of one sheet for his memory. In the eulogy we                     read of Guarino's benevolence toward the Father's orphanages, \"which were the                     object of tender love and deep compassion of the illustrious deceased\" (Vol. 45,                     page 32).                          Msgr. Paino declares,                          \"In  my  relations  with  him  I  was  always  very  edified  and  touched,  feeling                     admiration for his fervent piety, living faith, endless charity, zeal and ardor never                     satisfied. He always supported, and more than once preceded me in the works of                     charity that I was going to undertake to meet the needs of the diocese. He did                      so by comforting and encouraging me with so  a vigilant, affectionate, and tender                     care  that  I  cannot  help  remembering  him  without  shedding  tears.  I  felt  to  be                     before, and under the protection of a saint.\"                           Writing to Msgr. Parrillo, the Father pays homage to Msgr. Paino:","I must confess the truth: I along with the male and female members of my                     institutes  hold  Archbishop  Angel  Paino  as  an  angel  of  charity,  kindness,  and                     ardent zeal for the glory of God, as well as for the temporal and spiritual good of                     his mystical flock! He is about to undertake sublime works. As far as we can                     understand, we have noticed very singular virtues in this elect of the Lord, such                     as a purest intention, a deep piety, a very tender compassion for the poor and the                     sick, and an untiring activity. He combines these virtues for the glory of the Lord                     and  for  the  temporal  and  spiritual  good  of  all,  in  contempt  of  his  health  and                     comfort.    Unfortunately,  he  happens  to  experience  how  true  is  the  apostle's                     saying, \"Whoever wants to live in Jesus Christ, will suffer persecution.\" He finds                     persecutors among the clergy, above all among those to whom he proves himself                     strong by conscience. But me and Canon Vitale encourage and comfort him (Vol.                     29, page 48).                           To conclude, I emphasize that if the Father died at Guardia, it happened by                     obedience to Msgr. Paino. The Father felt himself dying, and he wouldn't have                     liked  going  over  there;  but  he  did  so  willingly  to  obey  the  will  of  the  Lord                     manifested through the archbishop.                        18. Msgr. D'Arrigo, Archbishop of Messina                                                 794                             In  the  l908  earthquake,  Msgr.  Letterio  D'Arrigo  was  the  archbishop  of                     Messina. The rebirth of the city on the same place is due to him. That's his chief                     merit. When General Mazza told the archbishop that the new city should be built                     in the plain of Milazzo, and invited him to abandon Messina","because its ruins were about to be bombed, he met a flat denial from D'Arrigo.                     As a result, the city-planning scheme was changed, and the city was rebuilt in the                     same place.                          In the appendix to La Scintilla (Jan. l955, l58-l62 installment), Father Caudo                     outlines a flattering eulogy of D'Arrigo's life and activity, and concludes, \"That I                     was able to say of the great Archbishop Letterio D'Arrigo.\"                          We are not going to question his eminent merits, zeal, and love for the native                     city; as well as his untiring care to make the city traditions revive in the fullness                     of Christian spirit after the December 28, l908, catastrophe. But, Father Caudo                     adds,  \"History  is  history,  which  cannot  be  mutilated,  or  altered.  This                     contemporary  history  will  be  handled  by  many  people  and  by  the  accurate                     historical archive of Messina.\" We emphasize that history must pay homage to                     the truth. Eulogy is fitting for epigraphs on the tombs, but where the rights of                     third  parties  are  at  stake,  truth  and  justice  cannot  be  compromised.  Both  the                     Father and Father Vitale are joined in this matter.                          As  for  the  separation  of  Roccalumera,  so  for  this  subject  we  rely  on  the                     Father's biographer, who will clear the events. Meanwhile, we outline them to                     make our readers understand the chief points.                          Before being appointed a bishop, Msgr. D'Arrigo was a Canon at the cathedral                     of Messina, and had hearty relations with the Father. Certainly, he shared the bias                     of the clergy, and said, \"The blessed Canon Di Francia had set himself into the                     mess of Avignone, and was unable to get out...\" Even though he was generous to            795                     the  Father,  D'Arrigo  now  and  then  warned  him,  \"Play  the  Canon  instead  of                     embarking these enterprises!\" However, any time debts and needs compelled the                     Father to resort to  D'Arrigo, who was rich  and generous, he never came back                     with empty hands. Furthermore, the Servant of God himself more than once says                     that  D'Arrigo  always  refused  the  restitution  of  borrowed  money.  Before  being                     appointed a bishop, D'Arrigo attended the feast of July first at Avignone every                     year. Meeting the wish of the Father, he also became the spiritual director of the                     Servant of God's mother and sister. As a professor of morals and canon law at the                     seminary, he had a predilection for the Father's clerics. In l98l he dedicated his                     church to the Sacred Heart.  On that occasion, the Father wrote the inscriptions                     which  were  carved  on  the  ornamental  marbles  of  the  altars.  At  last,  when                     D'Arrigo's mother died in l897, the Father wrote the inscription which was hung                     at the church's door for the funeral.","As a canon, D'arrigo shone among his colleagues in doctrine and goodness of                     heart.    He  was  the  dearest  disciple  of  Canon  Ardoino,  illustrious  professor  of                     morals. He was also the favorite of Archbishop Guarino and his Vicar General                     Joseph  Basile.  But,  all  at  once  his  relations  with  the  ecclesiastical  authority                     darkened. Father Caudo touched upon this matter on La Scintilla, and wrote two                     reports on  our request. Because the reasons  are alien to  our subject, we won't                     dwell  upon  them.  However,  it  is  necessary  that  we  point  out  to  the  sad  and                     painful consequences, because they regard us deeply.                          The clergy of Messina divided into parties. On one hand the priests faithful to                     the  legitimate  authority,  on  the  other  hand  the  opposers,  who  linked  up  with                     Canon D'Arrigo. Usually, the opposers met at D'Arrigo's Arcipeschieri house to                     speak  ill  of  the  superiors.  D'Arrrigo's  mother  was  grieved  by  hearing  them                     always speaking ill of the cardinal. Once she couldn't help speaking out, \"Leave                     him alone. What evil did he do to you?\" The hostility of the opposers against the                     archbishop, who was already created a cardinal, went so far that they set up a                     clandestine  publication  by  the  title  The  Diocese.  It  reached  a  serious  gravity                     during  the  preparation  for  the  golden  jubilee  of  Cardinal  Guarino,  who  was                     already struck by paralysis.                          The topic is sad and painful, therefore it would be better to hush it up. But, if                     we  did  so,  we  couldn't  understand  the  nature  of  the  relations  between  Msgr.                     D'Arrigo and the Father.                          Needless  to  say,  the  Father  disapproved  Canon  D'Arrigo's  behavior.  He       796                     supported the principle of authority and stood for Guarino, because he was his                     bishop. What the Father would have done to induce D'Arrigo to respect and obey                     his superior! But he was not in the condition of doing so personally.  His twin                     soul,  Father  Vitale,  did  his  best  to  achieve  reconciliation,  but  in  vain.  Father                     Vitale was allowed by the cardinal to invite D'Arrigo to preach the retreat to the                     clerics; as well as to take over the chair of morals at the seminary, after Father                     Muscolino's  death.  The  good  offices  of  Canon  Vitale  made  no  difference  in                     D'Arrigo's behavior.                          Cardinal  Guarino  died  in  September  l897.  Msgr.  Basile  was  elected  vicar                     general in the first election, but he renounced the office. D'Arrigo was elected                     vicar  general  in  the  second  election.  His  friends  began  launching  a  publicity                     campaign to make him","archbishop  of  Messina.  Writes  Father  Caudo,  \"They  made  a  clandestine                     subscription  of  few  people.  The  followers  of  D'Arrigo,  however,  above  all                     Bruno,  made  a  public  campaign.\"  Bruno  was  a  priest  who  had  abandoned  the                     diocese  because  of  disagreement  with  Guarino.  As  soon  as  D'Arrigo  was                     appointed  vicar  general,  he  recalled  Bruno  at  the  seminary,  and  made  other                     political  exile  priests  return.  Thus  a  good  group  working  to  make  D'Arrigo                     archbishop  was  formed.  Father  Caudo  names  some  bigwigs  who  supported                     D'Arrigo. He was elected archbishop, and entered Messina solemnly on March                     25, l898.                        19.  With the new diocesan curia                              Immediately,  Msgr.  D'Arrigo  designated  his  friends  canons:  Mangraviti,                     Bruno,  De  Francesco,  and  Carnazza,  setting  up  the  new  curia.  There  is  no                     objection  against  it,  because  he  chose  his  confidential  men.  Caudo,  however,                     writes, \"He treated with little liking the affectionate of Guarino who stood for the                     ecclesiastical authority during the opposition, or were neutral.\" This is the painful                     point of D'Arrigo government. He did not seek, or did not succeed in repairing            797                     the  scission  of  the  clergy  that  had  happened  before.  He  considered  the                     affectionate to Guarino as enemies, thinking of being hated by them. He always                     used these words. The division in the clergy lasted several years. In the time of                     Don Orione it was still alive.                          We state more precisely: Msgr. D'Arrigo did not persecute the affectionate to                     Guarino, nor did he make his government felt; on the contrary, he favored and                     made good to them on occasions. But, he did not trust them, always considering                     them  as  enemies.  We  use  these  words,  because  he  used  them.    He  did  not                     understand that at least the Father and Father Vitale were for, and with Guarino                     because Guarino was the superior. Likewise, when D'Arrigo was appointed to the                     office of superior, they stood for him.                          Let us return to the thread of the story. Writes Father Caudo,                          \"Canon Di Francia never shared the disagreement between","the archbishop and the followers of D'Arrigo, but his affection to Guarino was                     enough to make himself looked upon with suspicion by the new curia.\"                           Furthermore,  D'Arrigo  shared  the  Messina  clergy's  bias  against  the  Father,                     and the scission of Canon Francis in the foundation of a house at Roccalumera                     worsened things. Listen to Father Caudo.                           \"I  was  in  the  houses  of  Avignone  teaching  some  youth,  such  as  Russello,                     Chiapparone,  Pergolizzi,  etc.  therefore,  I  often  heard  speaking  of  the                     disagreement among the two brothers. But I noticed the following: Don Hannibal                     never spoke ill of his brother; only now and then he cleared himself of what his                     brother was charging him with.\"                           An additional source of misunderstanding was the union of the Father with                     Father Vitale. They knew and loved each other since l886. Since then Di Francia                     became  the  Father,  and  Vitale  showed  himself  as  a  loving,  faithful  son.  This                     strong  friendship  aroused  suspicion,  because  Vitale  had  been  favored  by                     Guarino. In fact, he was designated spiritual director at the seminary, and was                     elected canon at the age of 28. It is true that Father Vitale gave several proofs of                     esteem and reverence to D'Arrigo, but he had the original sin of having been a                     favorite of Guarino. Therefore, Father Caudo points out,                                                                                                               798                          \"Vitale  was  hardly  respected  by  the  new  archbishop,  who  held  him  a                     hypocrite!\"                           D'Arrigo is to be pitied... so far he was seduced by those who surrounded him!                     Father Caudo felt badly, and was so struck as to write,                           \"I felt in my heart a great decrease of my esteem for D'Arrigo's virtues.\"                           We have touched upon this subject to explain the  mood of Msgr. D'Arrigo                     toward the Father. Thus, we can understand several witnesses.                          The  Father  couldn't  help  understanding  the  spirit  of  the  archbishop,  but                     charged himself with fault. In fact, in his funeral oration he writes, \"He isolated                     himself and the Pious Institution from Msgr. D'Arrigo, Archbishop of Messina\"                     (S.C. Vol. 7, page 242).","20. His friendship with Don Orione                              After the l908 earthquake Saint Pius X designated Don Orione vicar general of                     the diocese of Messina. He held the office from June 25, l909, to February 7,                     l9l2.  The two Servants of God understood each other, but their friendly, fraternal                     relation was another reason why Msgr. D'Arrigo distrusted the Father.                          In l967, Msgr. Pantaleone Minutoli, vicar general of Messina, published the                     fourth book of Messina ieri e oggi. It treats mostly about Msgr. D'Arrigo's work.                     While congratulating him upon the publication, I remarked, \"It is a pity that from                     the  processes  of  Don  Orione  and  the  Father  some  shadows  fall  down  on  the                     memory of Msgr. D'Arrigo, which is impossible to dissipate.\"  He responded to                     me, \"I do not agree upon your writing about Msgr. D'Arrigo. If you want, not                     only the shadows will disappear, but the three personalities will illuminate one                     another, becoming three stars in the sky of Messina. I venerate the three. Let us                     help one another. I would like that also the children of Don Orione understand                     this.\"  How kind and dearest Minutoli was. He has been my side by side fellow                     student of theology for four years at the seminary of Messina! But, may he rest in                     peace, facts are at stake here, not will. Facts are facts, and history is history!                          The Father knew of Don Orione in l900 and congratulated him because still a                     young  priest  had  consecrated  himself,  spirit  and  body,  mind  and  heart  to  the   799                     service of our Lord Jesus Christ. He pledges his daily prayer for him and augurs                     a meeting in Sicily, because Don Orione had opened a house at Noto (S.C. Vol.                     7, page ll8). Such a meeting happened in the tragic event of the earthquake. They                     understood each other perfectly, and their friendship became like David's  and                     Jonathan's (l Sam. l8, l). When Don Orione  came to Messina in l922 or l923,                     Father Vitale introduced him to us as a great friend of our Father. Don Orione                     underlined these words with pleasure by saying, \"A real friend, a real friend!\"                          That being stated,  we cannot pass  over in silence  that the vicariate of Don                     Orione in Messina was a very martyrdom! We confine ourselves to saying that                     Msgr.  D'Arrigo  did  not  understand,  nor  did  he  trust  Don  Orione!  I  reveal  no                     secret by recalling what the postulator of the Orionini published in the articles for","the apostolic process of Don Orione. Msgr. D'Arrigo described Don Orione at the                     congregation of the bishops as \"a man of half conscience who is able to make a                     settlement  with  everyone,  avoids  the  conflicts,  and  trumpets  against  the                     archbishop,  boasting  of  being  under  the  ample  protection  of  the  Holy  Father\"                     (art. l25).                          What a difficult environment for Don Orione! But the Father supported him                     openly. Don Sante Gemelli of the Sons of Divine Providence said that Canon Di                     Francia was the visible guardian angel of Don Orione, in that time!                          Don Orione and the Father bound fast, we can imagine how Msgr. D'Arrigo                     and his friends regarded the Father.  Given this environment, we understand the                     following  relation,  \"After  the  l908  earthquake,  I  knew  incidentally  from  the                     archbishop's  secretary,  Msgr.  Mangraviti,  that  some  people  murmured  against                     Msgr. D'Arrigo and that Don Orione and Canon Di Francia shared in this group.\"                     For  this  reason  Msgr.  D'Arrigo  dissuaded  Canon  Celona  from  living  together                     with the Father.                         2l.   Msgr. D'Arrigo                             and the Rogationists                                                               800                                  Let  us  see  some  relations  about  Msgr.  D'Arrigo's  attitude  toward  the                     Rogationists.                           \"I  heard  incidentally  that  the  Servant  of  God  along  with  Father  Vitale  was                     charged with having little affection to Msgr. D'Arrigo, Archbishop of Messina.                     Such a situation dated back to the election  of D'Arrigo as vicar general.  The                     point  is  that  the  archbishop  wished  the  institute  at  disposal  of  the  diocese,                     whereas the Servant of God looked beyond.\"                          Evidently,  the  witness  ignores  the  precedent  we  have  talked  about,  and                     confines the dissent to the nature and aim of the","institute. The institute was born with the title \"Regular Clerics for the Poor of the                     Sacred  Heart,\"  and  Msgr.  D'Arrigo  blessed  it  on  the  feast  of  Saint  Joseph's                     patronage,  May  6,  l900.  But  he  thought  of  a  college  aiming  at  preparing  the                     priests for the diocese. In fact, as soon as the youths were ordained priests, he                     destined  them  to  the  parishes.  The  Father  instead  wanted  a  religious                     congregation,  and  from  the  beginning  he  announced  a  regular  novitiate  at  the                     proper  time.  But  the  youth  held  firm  to  the  priesthood  without  thinking  of                     religious life. So, when the Father proposed the novitiate in l904, they left the                     Father and were received in the seminary by Msgr. D'Arrigo.                          The Father had to begin over again. The recognition of the institute by Msgr.                     D'Arrigo was by words, so the Father asked him in l909 for the decree of erection                     (Vol.  29,  page  26).  After  the  earthquake,  the  Father  had  grounds  to  ask  the                     decree, because its institute was already beyond the limits of the diocese. But,                     Msgr.  D'Arrigo  deemed  to  have  a  new  reason  to  deny  it  for  the  presumed                     collusion with Don Orione; therefore, he did nothing. Nor did he do anything in                     l9l9,  when  the  Father  submitted  the  constitutions  of  the  institute,  which  were                     elaborated according to the new canon law (Vol. 29, page 32).                          However, we must point out to the change of Msgr. D'Arrigo's ideas about the                     institute. It happened in his last years.                          In  fact,  by  admitting  the  first  Rogationists  to  receive  the  tonsure,  he                     renounced  relying  on  them.  He  made  them  swear  that  they  were  ordained  on                     behalf of the Rogationist congregation existent in fact, and that they would hinge        801                     to the diocese of Messina if the congregation would not achieve the canonical                     erection.                          If Msgr. D'Arrigo did not arrive at approving the constitutions, it depended on                     his character of centralizer, who wanted to do everything by himself.  He himself                     wrote in full the list of the masses to be celebrated!  Therefore, the manuscript                     laid for years on his table, buried under an avalanche of papers until the Lord                     called the archbishop to paradise.","22. \"We couldn't be of God...\"                              In September l922 Msgr. D'Arrigo celebrated the golden jubilee. Wishing him                     all  the  best  with  the  communities,  the  Father  said  some  words,  among  which                     these ones, \"Excellence, the nothing that we are, are yours; and we couldn't be of                     God if we were not yours!\" (Vol. 45, page 550).                          \"Very well! Enthusiastically said Msgr. Paino, who received a new proof of                     the  Father's  good  spirit.  But,  over  so  many  years,  Msgr.  D'Arrigo  did  not                     understand it.                          The principle of faith in the authority was the golden rule which guided the                     Father all his life long. For him, authority represented God!                          His exhortation to Saro Marchese is significant. Mr. Marchese had dealt with                     Canon D'Arrigo familiarly for long years; but when D'Arrigo became a bishop,                     the Father insisted that Mr. Marchese venerate his dignity. \"I still remember his                     warnings. When I was before Archbishop D'Arrigo, I had to consider the bishop,                     the apostle, not Msgr. D'Arrigo. Therefore I had to kneel and to kiss his ring with                     great  devotion.\"    Father  D'Agostino,  a  former  Rogationist,  remembers,  \"When                     the  Father  had  to  obey  the  superiors,  he  flew.  I  suppose  that  one  day  Msgr.                     D'Arrigo suggested the Father to reduce my tasks so that I might dedicate myself                     to the study as preparation for priesthood. As soon as he came back home, he              802                     told me, \"Do not worry about anything, but study!\"                          More  witnesses:  \"Even  though  Archbishop  D'Arrigo,  the  successor  to                     Cardinal  Guarino,  was  not  fine  with  the  Father,  the  Servant  of  God  never                     opposed or disobeyed him. I realized that from persons who were disgusted by                     the  opposition  of  the  ecclesiastical  authority  to  Canon  Di  Francia  and  his                     institutes.  But  the  Servant  of  God  never  complained,  nor  did  he  speak  ill.\"                     \"Before I entered the institute I knew that the diocesan curia had a grudge against                     the Servant of God... he instead bound himself more","strongly to the Heart of Jesus. I have been on the Father's side for 22 years, and                     never heard a word of regret against his superiors.\" \"A few sisters told me that he                     was obedient to Archbishop D'Arrigo, even though the Ordinary was not always                     benevolent with him... but I knew nothing from the Father. On the contrary, he                     always spoke well of the archbishop, exhorting us to obey.\"                          When a disposition by the curia hurt some feelings, the Father did his best to                     justify the curia. Once, a sister hinted at the bishop's previous dispositions against                     our religious clerics. The Father intervened, \"Silence, silence. The Lord speaks                     through the superiors. Were they to destroy the congregation, I would be happy                     the same in order to obey.\"                        23. Always faithful                              Not only the Father was obedient to D'Arrigo, but also faithful to him, giving                     proofs of affection and devotion.                          For the vitality of the institution the Father confides in the protection and the                     moral help of the shepherd: \"Without this protection and help we would fail like                     little plants which wither as soon as they sprout in the field\" (Vol. 29, page 24).       803                     He declares, \"The formation of a congregation depends on the favor and blessing                     of the spiritual shepherd more than on the human protections and the plenty of                     terrestrial means. We say with the prophet, 'Some confide in the cars, others in                     the horses, but we in the name of the Lord'.\" He concludes imploring \"a copious,                     effective  blessing  that  like  celestial  dew  penetrates  our  souls  giving  grace,                     fertility,  perseverance,  and  life\"  (Ibid.  page  l3).  On  another  occasion  he                     confesses,  \"The  protection  of  the  bishop  for  us  is  the  greatest  treasure,  the                     palladium of our existence, and the safety shield in any conflict\" (Ibid. page l4).                          We have also a lyric poetry for the name's day of Msgr. D'Arrico (page 265),                     as  well  as  other  works  for  his  sacred  visit  to  Taormina  and  Graniti.  On  the                     seventieth anniversary of the archbishop, the Father published two speeches; on                     the golden","jubilee, a speech and five prayers, as well as verses for the solemn triduo in the                     cathedral, which began with the preaching by the Father.                          Eugenio Toscano, an editor of a city newspaper and  a cousin of the Father,                     published a scornful phrase in l907. The Servant of God defended the archbishop                     in these terms:                          My dearest Eugenio, in the last issue of Germinal you gave me, I read that our                     archbishop is named \"The Sacristan D'Arrigo!\"                          I was scandalized!                          I am very sorry for you who are throwing yourself into an abyss! You begin                     offending God seriously, grieving his divine Heart! Bit by bit you are losing the                     consideration  and  the  remorse  for  what  you  are  doing!  It  may  be  that  other                     people wrote this scornful phrase against the anointed of the Lord, but you are                     the editor, the representative of the newspaper. Therefore,  you are responsible                     before God and your conscience.                          Great is the dignity of the priests; greater that of the bishops. Jesus Christ said                     of them, 'You are like gods,' and, 'Whoever despises you, despises me.'                          You  can  object,  \"But  the  bishop  and  the  priests  do  not  comply  with  their                     duties.\"                          First of all, it is not your duty, nor are you qualified for judging whether the                     bishop  is  up  to  his  sublime  ministry.  If  all  of  us  are  forbidden  to  judge  our                     brothers - the apostle said, \"Who are you to judge your brother?\" - at a greater                     reason we are forbidden to judge the ecclesiastical superiors. You instead judge          804                     and scorn your superior! Know that you are a subject of the bishop; he has the                     ecclesiastical power over the consciences.                          It  may  be  that  some  priests  fail  in  something.  And  so  what?  Everyone  is                     forbidden to scorn people, all the more the priests; none is allowed to publish the                     faults of others, all the more of the anointed of the Lord! When Cam jeered at his                     father Noah sleeping naked and benumbed by wine, he was cursed by Noah. On                     the  contrary,  Sem  and  Japheth  approached  him  backward  out  of  respect,  and                     covered him with a blanket. By doing so, they were blessed by Noah!                          Like  Ham,  those  who  publish  and  deride  the  faults  of  the  priests  will  be                     cursed by God. Like Sem and Japheth,those who excuse and conceal the faults of                     the priests will be blessed!                          God is jealous of his priests and wants them unoffended. It is written, \"Do not                     touch my anointed.\"                          My  dearest  Eugenio,  the  way  you  are  walking  is  very  bad!  As  a  priest,  a                     friend, and a cousin I warn you that God can punish you severely! He can render                     you unhappy in this and the after-life! Do not","think of God leaving people doing for ever what they want. He reserves his day                     to make justice!\" (September 9, l907).(5)                           We  point  out  another  intervention  by  the  Father  pro  Msgr.  D'Arrigo  in  a                     painful circumstance.                          The  last  years  of  the  archbishop  were  poisoned  by  foolhardy  persons  who                     published a clandestine libel by the title The New Diocese (June l920). The sub-                     title was \"Qui gladio ferit, gladio perit!\" That is, those who use the sword are                     destroyed by it! It was an evident reference to the Diocese which was published                     against Cardinal Guarino.                          The Father was grieved beyond any saying. One day the Servant of God and                     Father Vitale were at table with Father Catanese and Vicar Antonuccio of San                     Pier Niceto. They talked of the event which had aroused the indignation of the                     city. I was waiting on them. At a certain point of the discussion, the Father said,                           \"There is one thing in this painful event that worries me most. The citizens of                     Messina  know  very  well  the  archbishop;  they  will  not  let  themselves  cheated.                     The archbishop is calm because of his pure conscience. But the thought which                     grieves  me  is  the  following:  the  writers  of  the  paper  are  surely  priests  who                     commit a grave fault, and we think that they say mass sacrilegiously...\"                           Meanwhile,  none  in  the  city  was  taking  an  initiative  in  favor  of  the     805                     archbishop.  Then,  the  Father  dictated  a  vigorous  \"Protest  of  Messina  Clergy                     Against a Slanderous Libel About the Venerable Excellence Msgr. Don Letterio                     D'Arrigo,  Archbishop  and  Archimandrite  of  Messina.\"  We  quote  only  the                     following paragraph:                           \"We protest not because our action is necessary to give the lie to the charges,                     or to make up His Excellence. We know very well that like gold our archbishop                     doesn't  blacken  when  he  is  touched  by  mud.  But  we  protest  to  have  the  high                     honor  of  manifesting  our  sincere,  profound,  sacred  homage  and  filial  love  we                     have always nurtured for our very deserving shepherd\" (S.C. Vol. 5, page 296).                           Such a protest was published and spread under the signature of the members                     of the chapter, and the priests.                          Msgr.  D'Arrigo  died  suddenly  in  the  morning  of  December  l8,  l922.  The                     Rogationists  informed  the  Father  by  telegram,  and  he  left  immediately  from                     Taranto to Messina. I remember the","meeting of our community with him.                          Sad and grieved, the Father told us, \"Msgr. D'Arrigo died!\" He began talking of the                     archbishop's merits and virtues, adding: \"Surely, we cannot forget him. He was so good                     and  fatherly,  always  giving  us  full  freedom.  He  never  meddled  in  the  affairs  of  our                     community, nor he asked an account of them, even though he had the right to do so. We                     always did what we wanted...\"                          Our  community  said  the  prayers  for  the  late  Msgr.  D'Arrigo,  but  the  Father                     celebrated  seven  masses  for  him,  as  he  used  for  the  priests.  Then,  taken  into                     consideration  the  responsibility  of  the  bishops,  the  Father  added  a  course  of  thirty                     Gregorian masses.                          The January 2l, l923, the First Department of the Youth Explorers commemorated                     the late archbishop. The Father not only placed the Holy Spirit's hall at their disposal,                     but also accepted the invitation to say the commemoration speech. Before the crowd he                     sang the virtues of the archbishop with warm, trenchant style, substantiating his words                     with touching episodes.                          These were the relations between the Father and Msgr. D'Arrigo.                        Notes                                                                                                                  806                           (l) The various witnesses on this subject refer to the last years of the Father. They                     mean that usually, he didn't carry money. It is obvious that while traveling alone, he had                     it; but sooner or later it ended into the hands of the poor.                           (2) With these words the Father is ahead of the \"Perfectae caritatis\" (l4):  \"Far from                     lowering the dignity of the human person, religious obedience leads it to maturity by                     extending the freedom of the sons of God. -                           (3) I read on a paper of the Father a few notes about the persons who always find                     faults in the superiors.                           \"This superior behaves badly!\"  \"And you?... Now, if you behave badly, how do you                     dare to censure others?\"  You can say,  \"If I held that office, I wouldn't take that action,                     I would behave differently in that case!  \"You are","wrong!\"  Everyone knows that people who see things from outside and calmly, have a                     different sight from those who are involved. Now, even though your judgment may be                     right,  you  judge  in  cold  blood  what  position  you  would  take;  but,  you  are  not                     considering the superior who is in the midst of opposite predicaments, and absorbed by                     the  whole  business.  In  such  a  situation  you  too  would  fail!  Who  assures  you  the                     contrary? Or at least, you would be right in one action, but wrong in so many others.                     And yet, you do not pay attention to the right actions of your superiors. In fact, you do                     not talk of them, but are on the look out to catch their faults! Be cautious! It may be that                     your being on the look  out  to  censure has  caused some damage to  the sight  of  your                     spirit, and therefore you judge everything wrongly, censuring what you should praise,                     the good! Are you perhaps one of those who always see things upside down, and are                     never satisfied? If the superior is zealous, you call him an imprudent; if he is a prudent,                     you call him a shy; if he punishes someone, you blame him for his rigor; if he forgives,                     you charge him with weakness; if he hurries, you say that he is ruining everything by                     rushing; if he lingers, you say that he doesn't take care of repairing; if he does nothing,                     you say that many things should be done; if he eventually does something good, you                     remember what he failed to do. Don't you see that you are never satisfied, never bridling                     your mordent tongue? You fancy how people must do good and avoid evil; which are                     the  limits  of  the  virtue,  the  rules  of  moderation,  the  duties,  etc.  In  short,  you  fancy                     handling the scales of the just and the honest, and in this scales of your imagination you                     weigh the actions of your superiors. Don't you see that your daring makes you the only                     guilty, while you think of yourself as the judge? Don't you see that your arrogating a                     right of others' business proves that you are an ignorant of the right and duty?  While                     you judge things, you are like a sick who calls the sweet bitter, and the bitter sweet,   807                     because his palate is sick. So, because you have lost the sense of right and honest - it is                     not  right  nor  honest  to  freely  judge  and  censure  your  superiors  -  you  are  unable  to                     distinguish truth from falsehood\" (Vol. 27, page ll9).                              (4) According to traditional ascetism, the Father often speaks of blind obedience,                     against  which  people  rebel  today.  The  only  speaking  of  it  is  a  scandal.  We  need  to                     understand the significance of the terms. Dialogue may be ample, open at the highest,                     but the authority of the superior belongs to the nature of obedience.  It is his duty to                     decide what to do.  If the superior makes a decision contrary to the perceptions of the                     subject, the subject - if he wants to obey - must obey blindly, or better yet, enlightened                     by faith. It is faith that makes us see the superiors as representatives of God; and the                     sacrifice of our obedience unites us to his will more strongly and safely (P.C. no. l4).                              (5) We like quoting the continuation of the letter containing fatherly warnings to                     the cousin who had forgot the interest of his soul:                          \"You should not forget the days of your childhood when you grew up a Christian                     educated by good principles, being even a monitor in the school of catechism. How long                     has it been since you have gone to confession and holy Communion?...                          The perverse world has surrounded you. They show the lucre, sing your praise, and                     inebriate you. But they betray you completely by making use of you for their purpose!                     When they needed a typography and a skilled printer, they looked at you, a poor youth!                     I am  deeply pierced by  pain  for  you! You cannot  be happy  while walking this  way.                     Don't believe that you will be rich or get a prized reputation. The wicked never prosper,                     and true reputation is","achieved with the wise, the honest, nor with the dupes, unhappy, perverse cheaters!                          Dearest Eugenio, think of your soul, of the hanging death. Sooner or later we will be                     called to the tribunal of God; therefore, avoid the risk of loosing yourself for ever!                          Listen to my word. I am an affectionate relative who knows the risk you are running!                          I understand that when a person has walked a long way unfortunately, it is hard to go                     back at once. At least, begin thinking of your state, fearing it. Lift your eyes to heaven                     when you are alone, and pray to the Most High, the Immaculate Mother of God. Beg                     forgiveness, time, and grace to return to the right way! Pray to God that he may prevent                     you from doing anything against his most holy will and law.                          I will never stop praying for you every day so that you may walk another way and                     free yourself from the slavery of the world! May you be again a good Christian and a                     Catholic according to the traditions of our families, as you were before!\"                           Postscript: \"Hold this letter as a warning from God, who wants you saved!\"                                                                                                                        808","ENDING                                                                                                                                               809","A                             t the end of our work we deem to listen to the generic, comprehensive                             opinions of the persons who knew the Father.                               First of all let us recall that the judgment on the virtues of a Servant of                     God is reserved to the holy Church.  Only the Church is in the position to value                     the virtue of its children and pronounce an exclusive, final sentence upon it.                           However, the Church permits private opinions; it rather requires them in the                     process, demanding the witnesses to freely open their thoughts.  But we must be                     aware  that  such  opinions  are  private  ones.    Furthermore,  if  people  want  to                     publish them, they have to declare that such opinions are not meant to anticipate                     the decision of the Holy See. We made no declaration of this kind at the opening                     of  this  work;  because  it  is  reserved  to  the  private  use  pro  manuscripto  of  our                     communities.  But we do so now to  remind ours that we accept the reported                     evidences  about  the virtues  and holiness of the Father with the reservation that                     we submit  them  with  perfect  obedience to the  authority  of  the Church.                           Therefore, let us read the evidences.                           \"As for me, the Father's heroic practice of the virtue chiefly lies in the charity                     he practiced readily, continuously, and with delight in an absolutely exceptional                     way.\"                                                                                     810                           \"The heroic manifestations of charity imply the heroism of the other virtues,                     as for instance,                          His  patience  in  suffering  the  insults  launched  against  him  because  of  his                     charitable  mission.  His  patience  was  such  that  not  only    he  never  told  us  his                     suffering,    but  also  delighted  in    it,  thinking    that    it  was  an  indispensable                     requisite for the life of the institution.                          His Fortitude,   the Christian, apostolic perseverance in making up   the ranks                     destroyed,  or  almost  destroyed  by  the  previous  storms.  He  did  so  all  his  life                     long.\"                           \"The  heroism  of  the  virtues  practiced  by  the  Father  is  the  outcome  of  his                     profound, interior life. He ever sought to please God with his actions aiming at                     the greatest glory of the Lord, while concealing himself.\"                           \"His virtues were not of shallow roots; they were deeply rooted.   I saw him                     slightly run the virtues leading to holiness. Any","time  I approached Canon Di Francia,  I did  so  with  great enthusiasm  because I                     was always edified.  My impressions turned out to be convictions. They are: he is                     a holy priest forgetful of himself, humble and meek, poor as a Franciscan, full of                     interior  life  and  of  a  singular  piety.  His  charity  for  the  poor  was  such  a                     characteristic that to point out to a charitable man, the citizens said, and still say:                     'He is like Canon Di Francia'.\"                          \"I noticed the heroism in several virtues, especially poverty, humility, trust in                     the Lord, fortitude, and love for God and neighbor.\" \"His virtues were heroic.                     Only the heroism of his virtues can explain his various, great works. His practice                     of the virtues appeared spontaneous.\" \"Today's people's opinion on his holiness is                     like yesterday.  To say 'Canon Di Francia' in Messina is like mentioning a saint.                     It happens for his virtues, and is a public opinion.\"                          \"Taking into consideration his life, I affirm that he lived the virtues almost                     spontaneously and in full.  I would say that his brightest virtues were faith in God                     and charity for our neighbor.  God was always present to him, and the feelings of                     the Servant of God for such a presence appeared from his words.  On the other                     hand, his charity for our neighbor was almost the reason of his existence.  Owing                     to these virtues I hold him a saint.\"                          \"I deduce the heroism of the Father's virtues from his way of talking to us.  He                     almost  changed,  became  more  eloquent,  his  eyes  shone,  and  our  souls  were                     absorbed in following him, in his spiritual ascensions.\"                                                                                                               811                          Some more flowers.                           \"Every time I approached the Servant of God, I saw a man of God in his pale                     features, in his meditative appearance.  When  I listened  to  him  talking to his                     community in a  hall  near  the refectory,  my  opinion  was  corroborated.  In that                     evening he repeated the saying of Saint Paul,   `The Spirit too helps us in our                     weakness, for we do not know how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself                     makes  intercession  for  us  with  groaning  that  cannot  be  expressed  in  speech'                     (Rom. 8, 26). After thirty years I still  feel  listening  to  the fervent emphasis                     with  which  he pronounced  the  words  'grownings that cannot  be  expressed                     in speech'!\" (Father Cosimo Spina).                           \"I was impressed by the Canon as by a man pervaded with the spirit of God,                     enflamed  with  charity,  and  enamored  of  the  unprivileged  and  the  needy.    His                     institutions prove it.  His talk was sober, his hint of smile was suffused with mild                     reserve, and an angelic perfume surrounded him\" (Father Peter Elia).","\"When I opened my heart to him and asked for advice, I felt I was before a man                     of God.  I found him serene,  upright,  meek, humble,  generous,  charitable with                     everyone,  enlightened by the Holy  Spirit,  ready to foster any good initiative for                     the  poor, the  orphans,  and  the suffering\" (Canon  Treasurer  Dominic  De                     Candia).    Don  Joseph  Rinaldi,  well  known  as  the  founder  of  the  Vocation                     Institution in Rome, remembers the Father \"as a person full of zeal and love for                     our Lord.\"  The Servant of God sent  to him  \"a  generous  alms for the institution                     through  His  Eminence Cardinal  Pompili,  who speaking of Di Francia showed                     his  great esteem  for him,  holding him as a saint.  Knowing the cardinal's way of                     judging, I was amazed.\"                           Says Msgr.  Caruso,  Bishop of Cariati, \"I learned to admire this  singular man                     through the works of his  prodigious  charity; but, some years ago I happened to                     meet him in the bishop's palace of  Cariati  and I felt I was in the presence of a                     saint.  Since then I nurtured aveneration for him.\" Msgr.  Raphael Faggiani, a                     former provincial of the Passionists and successor to Msgr. Caruso, recalls the                     Father when he was a guest of his community in Manduria. \"I remember very                     well both his behavior and his talk which edified all the community.  On that                     occasion  I  made  this  consideration,  'How  this  soul  rises  quickly  from  the                     terrestrial things to the heavenly ones'!\"                          Msgr.    Costa,  Bishop  of  Lecce:    \"I  saw  the  Canon  only  twice  for  a  few                     moments, and I was struck by him as I was by his renown.  His person, face, and           812                     glance revealed holiness.\" Msgr. Taccone, a former bishop of Bova: \"I knew him                     at the Eucharistic congress in Palermo in l924.  Because I listened to his talk in                     the priestly section, I can bear witness to the general emotion aroused by his holy                     words in the assembly, which was edified and convinced of his holiness.  The                     name of the Servant of God is so venerated in Sicily, Calabria, and Apulia that it                     seems to be an anticipation of his glory.\"                           Let us quote Msgr. Paino's farewell to the Servant of God on the funeral day:                           \"O Saint, O Saint, let me say my last word to you.  Let me send my good-bye                     and that of the whole city...  O Saint,  accept the  last good-bye,  the last blessing,                     and the gesture  of  the crowd,   the  likes  of  this  perhaps  never  seen  in                     Messina, especially the","spectacle of this excited crowd that has come here to  say good-bye to you and to                     thank God who wanted to reward you in this way even on earth.                           We,  who  do  not  know how to  deprive  ourselves  of  you, recommend  us                     and our city to you.  The city will find the best realization of its ideals in the                     continuance  of  your  work.    Hence  our  communion  of  life  remains:    you  pray                     from there, while from here we will cry aloud: glory, glory, glory; and you will                     answer: charity, charity, charity...\" (Father Mary Hannibal Di Francia, page 372).                           We conclude with the opinion of two Servants of God.  Don Lorenzo Berteco,                     of the Pious Society of Saint Paul, writes that Don James Alberione preached to                     his clerics in Alba, the fall of l924, this way,                           \"Do you want to meet living saints?  Go to Turin and visit Canon Allamaro                     and Don Rinaldi; go to Liguria and will find Father Semeria; venture as far as                     Sicily and you will find Canon Di Francia.\"                           Don Orione:  for him the Father \"was absolutely a saint.\" Read his telegrams.                     At the death of the Servant of God he wrote:                           \"Deeply grieved for the death of the great priest of God, Canon Di Francia,                     apostle  of  charity,  glory  of  Messina  clergy,  and  honor  of  Sicily,  Italy,  and   813                     Church.  I  hug  his  Religious  and  orphans,  brotherly  comforting  them  in  the                     crucified Jesus.
